                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description">Our leaders have jeopardized the future of our nation and our society is starting to feel the consequences of such reckless decisions. They probably thought that they could actually get away with it. They believed they could create, borrow and spend giant piles of money without facing any issues. But, of course, that plan has backfired. Since the creation of the United States, there have been many governments that have surrendered to the temptation of creating massive amounts of dollars, and every single time, things have ended badly. So by now, those who are leading this country should've learned their lesson. <br />More money is not the cure for a financial system terminally broken, and they should know that by now. Those policies caused so many imbalances in our economy that, at this point, no one stops talking about inflation. On the mainstream media, the alleged specialists seem mystified that things have gotten so bad so quickly. But anyone with a shred of common sense should have been able to see that this was coming.<br />You just need to go to the website of the agency that started this whole process. And, in there, the latest data will show you that something is clearly off. Money has been created at an exponential rate. What is happening to our money supply is complete and utter lunacy. It's even worse than what happened during the Weimar Republic, or at any moment in history. This undoubtedly will annihilate the dollar eventually. Our leaders clearly deceived themselves into thinking they wouldn't deal with the consequences of creating money so recklessly. But things have escalated very quickly and people have started to notice. And they are getting increasingly angrier with what they're seeing.<br />Americans have been facing very painful inflation everywhere they go. Last week, the Labor Department reported inflation across a wide range of products that consumers buy on a daily basis was even worse than expected in October, hitting its highest level in more than 30 years. The consumer price index, which tracks the price of a basket of products, ranging from gasoline and health care to groceries and rents, shot up by 6.2% from a year ago, the biggest jump since December 1990 and significantly higher than the 5.9% Dow Jones estimate.<br />If the inflation rate was still calculated the way it used to be, we would already be well into the double digits right now. Estimates released by John Williams of shadowstats.com, point that if we used the same formula we used during the 80s, the official rate of inflation would be around 15 percent right now. And as opposed to what the Fed says, this is not going away any time soon. In fact, it is evolving into a major national crisis as we speak. <br />One of the components that led to this staggering surge in the overall rate of inflation is the price of gasoline. Last month, gasoline prices climbed almost 50% from the same month a year ago, the highest level since 2014. Even the President admitted that gas prices are “exceedingly high” and that the surge is causing &quot;a lot of anxiety&quot; in sour society. As the winter approaches, Americans should brace for even more expensive energy prices too. Last month, U.S. consumers had already faced the biggest jump in their energy bills in more than a decade, but prices are going to soar higher in the coming months.<br />In October, the price of electricity rose 6.5% from the same month a year ago while consumer expenses paid to utilities for natural gas increased 28%, according to numbers released Wednesday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Fuel oil faced a dramatic jump of 59%, and costs for propane, kerosene, and firewood shot up by about 35%, the data show.If wages were inflating at the same pace everything else is, then those increased costs would be offset by higher paychecks. But that is definitely not what's happening.   <br />Economists have been warning for quite a long time that this was coming, and sadly, what we've faced so far is just the very start of a much deeper crisis that will linger for decades. There's nothing the &quot;experts&quot; who are running the economy can do to reverse this crisis. In fact, Congress just passed another gigantic spending bill that will only make things worse. It is truly soul-crushing to admit but our course has been set and, at this point, there is no turning back. We're headed to the second stage of the economic collapse that started in 2020. And you can mark our words: America will never, ever be the same again.<br /><br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epiceconomist.com​">https://www.epiceconomist.com​</a>
