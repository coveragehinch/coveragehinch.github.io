Gathered in Castle Square carrying green and yellow balloons and ribbons, they handed out leaflets and chanted &quot;Free Dai Morris&quot;.<br /><br />The notorious Clydach murders<br />The Clydach murders were the most brutal multiple killings in Welsh history.<br />The brutal murder of three generations of a Swansea Valley family shocked the nation back in 1999 and led to one of the biggest murder investigations South Wales Police has ever seen.<br />Mandy Power, aged 34, her daughters Katie, 10, and Emily, eight, (all pictured) and their grandmother Doris Dawson, 80, were killed at their Kelvin Road home in Clydach.<br />First the killer entered his victims’ home, went upstairs and smashed a heavy fibreglass pole repeatedly into the face of 80-year-old invalid grandmother Doris Dawson.<br />When Mandy and her daughters arrived home, he killed them in identical, sadistic fashion.<br />The killer set fire to incinerate all trace of his actions.<br />Three years after the crimes, builder David Morris, now 55, was handed four life sentences for killing Mandy, 34, and her family.<br />The group's ultimate aim is to raise political awareness in the hope of forcing the case back open.<br />Geraint Evans, who helps to run the group, said at Sunday's rally: &quot;There's massive support for him, not only in Swansea but across the UK.<br />&quot;We are here to raise awareness in Swansea for the people who are not on social media.<br />&quot;The members just keep growing and at the moment we are getting between 200 and 300 a day.&quot;<br />Donna Hayes, from Penlan, was at the rally to &quot;raise awareness&quot; of the campaign.<br />&quot;I believe that Dai is innocent,&quot; the 49-year-old said.<br />&quot;I don't know the family but I feel strongly that he should not be where he is.<br />&quot;I'm here to raise more awareness and to hopefully see if anyone can come through with more evidence that can help to get him released.&quot;<br /><br />A lesbian affair<br />In the days and weeks after the Clydach murders, the public became gripped with the revelations about Mandy Power's lesbian relationship with a married police officer.<br />It emerged that Mandy's lover was a former women police sergeant married to a male officer who was the identical twin brother of a local police inspector who was the first officer on the scene.<br />All three police officers were arrested and repeatedly interviewed however none were charged.<br />It was only three years later that David Morris (pictured) faced court and was jailed for life.<br />Also at the event in Swansea was Michael O’Brien, who spent more than 11 years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit.<br />In recent weeks a social media group calling for Morris's release has gone from hundreds of members to almost 13,000.<br />David Jones, 65, from Penlan, said that the increase in the number of members and the turn-out on Sunday morning &quot;shows how strong the feeling is&quot; for Morris.<br />Darren Protheroe had travelled from Carmarthen to attend the rally as he has been supporting the campaign since it began.<br />The 41-year-old, originally from Gendros in Swansea, said that he is &quot;hoping to see Dai Morris's case reviewed by the Criminal Cases Review Commision (CCRC).&quot;<br />The group of campaigners met in Castle Square before heading to Maggie Dicks in Brynhyfryd where their previous public meeting was held.<br />Present at that meeting was former solicitor John Morris, who wrote the controversial 2017 book, The Clydach Murders: A Miscarriage of Justice.<br />&quot;Whether you like Dai Morris or not doesn’t really matter,&quot; he had told the meeting. &quot;Looking at the case from a totally objective point of view I can only come to the conclusion that he must be innocent.
