                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description">Jimmy has been a hard worker for the many years I’ve known him. He’s worked hard in college, he’s worked hard as an employee and he’s also been an incredible worker on Youtube, always trying to make sure that his content is enjoyed by everyone. I believe that he more than deserves this. When we were looking for places to live, I wanted to be able to give him that space, a place for him to film and to explore his own creative interests. And who’s to say that place couldn’t be pretty? <br /><br />Amazon Affiliate Links to Gear I use:<br />Sony A7S III: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jD0fxC">https://amzn.to/3jD0fxC</a><br />Vanguard Alta Pro 263AB Tripod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2O7V8Yn">https://amzn.to/2O7V8Yn</a><br />M1 Macbook Air: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3rV5Zru">https://amzn.to/3rV5Zru</a><br />Philips Hue Light Strip: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VZq2EV">https://amzn.to/2VZq2EV</a><br />Godox SL-60W: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/37LsdT0">https://amzn.to/37LsdT0</a><br />Rode VideoMic NTG:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2RKHVrL">https://amzn.to/2RKHVrL</a><br />Shure SM7B: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/30Dxji7">https://amzn.to/30Dxji7</a><br />Logitech MX Master 3: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/30G1GV2">https://amzn.to/30G1GV2</a><br />Logitech MX keys: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bHytQ8yo">https://amzn.to/3bHytQ8yo</a><br /><br />TimeStamps:<br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:19 Planning the Space with Jimmy<br />6:24 Designing the Space<br />8:58 Reveal<br />10:02 What's Inside<br />14:42 Closing Thoughts<br /><br />So before I show you what we both did to make this space his own, we’re going to go over some of the things he wants in his room. It all depends on the person which is why we will be discussing it together in order to be on the right page. <br /><br />This is the result of planning and experimenting with colors and furniture pieces that resulted in Jimmy’s new studio space. It’s been an interesting journey and I’ve had fun planning this with Jimmy every step of the way. We’ve had to change our ideas a few times, but at the end of this project, we created this wonderful space to work in, relax in, and film in. I’ve never decorated a guy’s space before and I’d like to think I did pretty well in creating this for Jimmy so without further ado, lets take a look around at some of the pieces and bumps in the road that we had along the way<br /><br />One of which was actually the standing desk that we planned to make. Unfortunately, the Karlby countertop has been completely sold out in the Houston Ikea that we go to. So we had to find another way to get the counter top that Jimmy wanted. Jimmy came to the decision that he’d want to get a butcher block from like Home Depot or something, but I remembered that my parents had recently disassembled a kitchen island that belonged to my grandmother that had a butcher block counter top. We sanded it down, stained it and even gave it a nice protective coat. We placed the wooden top on the pair of standing legs which wasn’t too difficult but it was pretty heavy, and it looks insanely nice. <br /><br />The next part of our room make over journey was painting the walls in Jimmy’s room I was a bit nervous about the black wall Jimmy wanted for his room. I didn’t think it’d be nice to look at and I thought it would make the room smaller. But Jimmy was very clear he really really wanted it, so I let him have it this one time. We ended up choosing the paint color Black Ink by Benjamin Moore paint, as his color for the one black wall he wanted. As for the other walls those were in the paint color Chantily Lace which was also by Benjamin Moore. <br /><br />As far as storage goes, we had tons of fun with that. First we have this beautiful bookcase from Target. It’s relatively inexpensive and comes in three different shelf colors. There is a ladder version that screws into the wall if you want that, and it’s cheaper too. In his closet we’ve added a few storage pieces like the Ikea Skadis peg boards. These are cheap and very popular since they come in a variety of colors, sizes, and accessories to make your pegboard your own. On his SKADIS he’s been using storage containers and straps to hold his smaller equipment, making use of the narrow closet to the best of his abilities. <br /><br />And finally we have this exceptionally large Husky Tool chest. The tool chest is more functional in this space. It works as a product workbench and storage for equipment that’s fragile since the drawers have built in mats to help minimize damage. It looks actually well in the room despite it being a piece most people place in their garages. And it’s been incredibly useful with its built in power adapter, allowing him to charge his equipment in a secure space. <br /><br />In his corner spot of his room he has a lounge chair that we got from west elm. This one is the Lucas Swivel Chair and it’s probably one of the more expensive pieces in this room. Retailing for about 1,399 USD, it’s not something I would pressure anyone into buying. If you’re really into the style of this chair and you don’t mind getting it in fabric rather than leather the EKENÄSET, from Ikea has similar mid century vibes for only $200. <br /><br />Besides that we decorated the space out with ambient lighting, sheer linen curtains, and a throw blanket, just in case. I was so happy to really give Jimmy a place to work in. He really is super generous and patient with me and he works so hard that I really wanted our newest place to feel like a home.
