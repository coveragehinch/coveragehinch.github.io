From the mesmerizing clown triggerfish to the almost cartoon looking Picasso Triggerfish, these are the 10 most beautiful Aquarium Fishes in the world that will make you keep some of these as pets. Let’s begin...<br /><br />Body <br /><br />10<br />Lionfish<br />You can also call them Dragon Fish, Scorpion Fish or Tiger Fish. By the way, they are native to the Pacific Ocean and are actually considered invasive in North America. It is all because they eliminate native species and don’t have any natural predators. In fact, they are known to reproduce quickly as they release up to 30,000 eggs every week! People love to add them in their aquariums because they can easily adapt to new environments. <br />Lionfish have the most striped bodies that make them look beautiful and their bodies are arranged in a zebra-like pattern and can be  found upto 2 to 16 inches long. The smallest fish got attracted towards their feathery like fins therefore they easily lure them in. You might be thinking that they are harmless but actually they have venomous spines that they use for self-defense. In fact, they sting humans, and it’s side effects are vomiting, dizziness and nausea- a kind of small price to pay to keep it in your tank by the way, its venom is not fatal. ) <br /><br />09) Clown Triggerfish<br />This fish is very easy to recognize as their lower half of their body is dark blue with white large spots and their upper half body comes with yellow skin and blakc dots over it. This striking species of fish has a yellow or white stripe across their face with a yellow snout. Just like Juveniles, they are also often reclusive but with time when they get mature they become a bit more territorial. Don’t ever keep them with any other semi-aggressive species but you can keep them with other larger fish. They require a large tank that can easily contain 120 gallons of water so they can easily swim in their space and can hide when needed. Clown triggerfish in the tank are often compared with dogs in the house and are considered equal as pets. <br /><br /><br />08) Regal Tang<br />This Regal Tang Fish got all the popularity from the Film, Finding the Nemo. In which there’s a character Dory which is exactly a cartoon version of the Regal Blue Tang which is also known as the Palette Surgeonfish, or you can call it common Surgeon, Hippo Tang or Pacific Blue Tang. With a bright blue color, their bodies have an oval shape that comes with a yellow tail and pectoral fins. The Adults ones do have a dark blue line over their bodies that runs across their dorsal fin and the curves at the back of their tail. In fact, this fish which was propelled into popularity gets mature, their color changes with time and their body becomes bluer.  And, just like Juveniles they come with bright yellow color with blue spots near their eyes and light blue at fin tips. <br /><br /><br /><br />07) Moorish Idol<br />This beautiful fish is also called the pin-up poster fish of coral reefs and is found in almost every underwater photographer’s portfolio. The Moorish Idol is native to the coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific Ocean and have large thick vertical stripes in contrasting black and white and also have a sunlight yellow patch that goes towards the back of their body. Their long snouts with a vibrant yellowy/orange mask running across make them look more attractive. And because of their long extravagant filament which trails out from the tip of the dorsal fin make them look astonishing among others. Did you know? That they closely resemble Butterflyfish, but they don’t belong to the same family despite having similar feeding habits. <br /><br /><br /><br />06) Picasso Triggerfish<br />Are you familiar with the Humuhumu Triggerfish? If yes congrats, you will be happy to know that its another name for Picasso Triggerfish. This beautiful fish has a wacky vibrant painted appearance that can easily grab your attention and with its tan colored body and blue/black stripes it does look almost like a cartoon character. They are native to the Indo-Pacific Ocean. In the aquarium they are such an outgoing species and can easily learn to recognize their beloved owner. But, never put a triggerfish with other triggerfish because they are aggressive and should be kept with other large fish or similar size of fish that should be around 10 inches in the tank.
