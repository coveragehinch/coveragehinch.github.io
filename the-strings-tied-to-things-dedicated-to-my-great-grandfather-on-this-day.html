                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description">The strings tied to things.<br /><br /><br />On the 27th of August 1915, Corporal William Barrows’ young wife Ettie, gave birth to a girl, Catherine Frances, (My Grandmother). A child that William would never hold, because he, along with a Second Lieutenant Coke &amp; a Corporal Wilson, were killed in action along with the eleven ‘cut-off’ Canadians they were trying to reach on the morning of the 2nd of June 1916, on this the first day of the Battle of Mont Sorrel.<br /><br />A battle that is regarded by many as ‘The day it turned’. A battle that would foretell the horrors &amp; unrelenting massacre of The Somme exactly one month later… The game had changed!<br /><br />More is known about the fate of his chum Lieutenant ‘Coke’ Thomas, as he was the son of Reverend David Thomas, of Garsington Rectory Oxford who was professor of mathematics at Trinity College.  <br /><br />Lieutenant Thomas worked at the Evesham branch of Lloyds bank (which is still open today). He went to Bromsgrove school where his record stated: ‘He was too capable and cheery to be left in the ranks permanently and he justified his promotion. Death came to him instantaneously, a shell busting at his feet’. If that account is true, and wasn’t merely written to soothe the recipient, then I like to assume therefore that the same fate befell the others. One blink here, one blink gone.<br /><br />All 14 brave Lions of men are laid to rest in one special corner of the Bedford House Cemetery in Belgium, with Arthur Coke Thomas in grave number 11, &amp; William Barrows in grave number 12…  now forever at each others’ side.<br /><br />This film is dedicated to the memory of a man without whom I would not exist, &amp; the memory of many without whom neither would our freedom. <br /><br /><br />Corporal William Barrows 13126. 6th Bn. Oxford &amp; Bucks Light Infantry (My Great Grandfather)<br /><br /><br />So deafening was the echo of this loss, my mother was named Astrid after The Queen of Belgium, &amp; my Grandmother herself was named ‘France’ (Frances) after the place where her father, a man she would never meet now rests.<br /><br />I only discovered my Great Grandfather was one of the fallen on Wednesday 5th February 2020, after research by my Aunt Carol. This was where I discovered that whist his long-term memory lives on with the naming of children, such was the pain, there seems a simultaneous attempt to ‘pretend it didn’t happen’ within the family.<br /><br />I have done all I can, &amp; even a kind client has helped with research (thank you Mr Flain), &amp; as a result, I now have in my possession dated copies of most of the Battalion diary, but the one thing I crave… is a photo. If anyone can help with this I would be eternally grateful… I need to know if I have his nose?<br /><br />To my knowledge, there aren’t any other musicians in my family, but I romantically assume that the young William could also pull a tune out of thin-air… when the spirit required.<br /><br /><br />_________________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br /><br />I only wrote the music for this on the 8th November. It ended up evolving into a complete &amp; much longer operatic song named:  ‘I will see you again’. Because it is performed from the perspective of my Great Grandfather who is ‘holding onto hope’ of seeing his wife again, &amp; kissing his daughters’ forehead for the first time. This hope being the source of his strength, as was the case with all those sweethearts and mothers. These boys who signed up for adventure… some merely for a lark, quickly realised they were standing at the gates of hell. A generation of Boys who became ‘Men in a moment’.<br /><br />_______________________________________________________<br /><br />I cannot wait for this to be uploaded for some respite from the sadness. Because delving into this subject over the last year has been a dark chapter, each time I come up for air more bruised than the time before… I truly THANKFULLY cannot imagine what it must have been like to be there. <br />However, this deep-dive has caused me to check myself &amp; realise all that I regularly take for granted, as I sit here often whining about the small stuff in front of a big fire from a comfortable sofa with comparatively all the world &amp; opportunity at my finger-tips.<br /><br />I have not been to this place before, but there is much music there!<br /><br />In this films hurried edit, I realised that a narration on top of lyrics was a mess, so the music here represents only an instrumental ‘teaser’ of a much longer circular piece with vocals, which I will perhaps soon allow a sneak peak.<br /><br />As I always say, “My aim is never to polish, but to try and capture some magic in a jar!”<br /><br />I have been writing music for twenty years longer than I have been making armour. As I mentioned in my previous video, armour is my obsession, but making music is my passion, though now I recognise that each fits beautifully in the hand of the other.<br /><br />All armour, props, music, filming, sounds, writing &amp; narration by me, Nigel Carren ©<br /><br />Recorded at The Ruin Studios, France.<br /><br />All Copyright Nigel Carren ©<br /><br />#history #armour #ww1 #music #song #poem #poetry #trench
