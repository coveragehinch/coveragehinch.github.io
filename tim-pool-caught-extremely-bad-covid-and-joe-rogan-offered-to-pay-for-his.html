                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description">As was inevitable, YouTuber @Tim Pool caught Covid-19. When he called a clinic seeking medical attention, he learned that they would not treat him with Ivermectin. Upon hearing this, Pool called Joe Rogan, as one does when faced with a dire medical emergency. Joe Rogan stepped up to the plate and put him in touch with a doctor who would prescribe him Ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies, and whatever random weird things these people think cure Covid nowadays. Pool says he only took the antibodies, which is a legit medical treatment. He says that it super cured him.<br />(We say it was inevitable because he didn't quarantine properly when it was most vital, inviting Sam Seder to travel to debate him in person in his studio, and also because he himself said that he is unvaccinated. Unvaccinated, undistanced, not careful, and in a job that involves different people coming in and out of your space is a good way to catch Covid-19. Oh! And he had an indoor event with hundreds of people and there were zero precautions in place. We are not glad that Tim Pool caught Covid; we hope he recovers quickly.)<br /><br />We stream our live show every day at 12 PM ET.<br /><br /><br /><br />We need your help to keep providing free videos!

About Tim Pool? <br />Matt Binder: Oh yeah, it was reported by the Daily Beast and he said it himself. He put out a video yesterday to explain his almost week-long absence. Tim Pool, who's never taken a a day off from streaming for like two years has been M.I.A. for the past couple of days. And his fans were starting to wonder what the hell was going on, and he had to put out a statement via video that he was very, very ill thanks to Covid. <br />EV: And he is unvaccinated according to him. <br />Matt Lech: He said he is unvaccinated? <br />EV: Yes. And that's probably why he has to take off time from streaming because the symptoms are a lot worse if you are not vaccinated.<br />MB: The story gets a lot better by the way. He went to, he called a facility, like a a clinic, for help and they wouldn't give him Ivermectin when he asked about it. So he called Joe Rogan, and Joe Rogan forwarded him to the people to get his kitchen sink from uh which includes the whatever they're called. The monocle antibodies.<br />EV: Monoclonal. Maybe same homeopathic doctor that Aaron Rodgers has on speed dial. MB: And the Ivermectin and another thing and another thing and according to Tim Pool, he only took the antibodies. He didn't take the Ivermectin because he didn't want people to accuse him of taking horse dewormer. But he said he spent something like 3,000 plus dollars on all this. <br />ML: All right, can we just stop a little bit here? So in parts of the story. So one, he wouldn't give him Ivermectin so he went to Joe Rogan?<br />MB: Yes, he called Joe Rogan. He said he went to Joe Rogan not to get the doctor's information, but just to speak with someone who has been through this the illness.<br />ML: Right, that's what he says. Let's just say like, that's something that most people can't do. They can't just say, &quot;Hey Joe — can you talk me through this and give me whatever doctor you had uh that gave you the Ivermectin?&quot; So when we say the horse paste thing, and people are like, &quot;Well actually, it has some human application.&quot; It does, but when doctors aren't prescribing it, people are going to the vet to get it. And that's why there's a run on the supplies for it. So that's one thing. And also if your doctor prescribes you Ivermectin I think you should probably take it. I think it is still being studied for some sort of effect for treating Covid. I mean the stuff about prophylaxis turned out to not be the case and be dangerous to repeat for people. Same with hydroxychloroquine.
