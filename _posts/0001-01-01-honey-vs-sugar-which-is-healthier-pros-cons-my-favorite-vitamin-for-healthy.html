My research keeps giving me contradictory results. I don‚Äôt sweeten my foods much, but when I do, I want to know what‚Äôs better for my health. Thanks‚Äù<br /><br />This is an interesting question and a good one since both honey and sugar are the two most commonly used sweeteners. <br /><br />Now, some will say honey is better for your health because it‚Äôs more natural. But then again, sugar cane is also natural. <br /><br />So, what‚Äôs the difference between the two, and is one a more healthy option?<br /><br />Similarities<br />Let‚Äôs first discuss what they have in common with each other.<br /><br />First, they are both carbohydrates. This means 1 gram has 4 calories, similar to protein. While 1 gram of fat has 9 calories.<br /><br />Second, both contain two forms of sugar: glucose and fructose.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: Just for learning purposes of if you want to sound smart around your friends, typically, when something ends in an ‚Äúose‚Äù, it‚Äôs a sugar. But if it ends in an ‚Äúase‚Äù, it‚Äôs an enzyme.<br /><br />For example, lacTOSE is the sugar found in milk. LacTASE is the enzyme that digests this sugar.<br /><br />FRUCTOSE is typically found in fruit. And GLUCOSE is typically found in complex carbs such as rice.<br />The proportions of glucose and fructose in honey and sugar slightly differ:<br />sugar is 50% fructose and 50% glucose<br />honey contains 40% fructose and 30% glucose<br />The remainder of the 30% of honey consists of:<br />water<br />pollen<br />Small amounts of minerals &amp; vitamins, including magnesium and potassium<br />These additional components may be responsible for some of the health benefits of honey.<br /><br />I'll also talk about:<br />- the negatives of sugar<br />- the postivies and negatives of honey<br /><br />==============¬≠<br />Thank you for watching.
