{% raw %}In this 'pro coaches amateur' video, join me for a morning training session with GB Climbing Coach Be Fuller. I headed down to Volume 1 to get the scoop on Be's best tips and techniques for more efficient climbing. She very kindly introduced me to some of her techniques for efficient climbing movement and shared some exercises and drills I can be incorporating into my training to see improvement in my climbing. <br /><br />A huge thank you to Be for sharing her wealth of climbing training knowledge. If you're thinking about looking into climbing coaching, I highly recommend booking a session with Be.
