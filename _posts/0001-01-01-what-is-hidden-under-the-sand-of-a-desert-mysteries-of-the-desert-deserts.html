{% raw %}Deserts have always been a topic of great debate among historians and theorists. For some people, deserts are little more than a barren wasteland. However, for others, deserts can be seen as beautiful landscapes. For the most part, we often differentiate between different types of deserts, depending on whether or not the desert sand is made up of gravel, salt, stone, ice, or normal sand. Though there is one thing in common with all of these areas - there is very little vegetation to be seen, if there is any at all. <br /><br />#TheUnknownList{% endraw %}
