{% raw %}Weâ€™ve said it before when Chinese officials warn the public about something, it means that the problem can no longer be contained. <br />After the Chinese government released the economic data for the third quarter of 2021, the official Chinese media warned the public to be careful about the risk of &quot;stagflation&quot;, which means that the economy is stagnating while unemployment and inflation continue to rise. <br />The Chinese people are quickly finding themselves in a situation where prices for everything are rising. At the same time, China is experiencing an unprecedented wave of unemployment.<br /><br />Have questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
