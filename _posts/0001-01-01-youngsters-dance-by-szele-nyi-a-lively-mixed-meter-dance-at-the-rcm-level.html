{% raw %}A lively mixed-meter dance at the RCM Level 6 and ABRSM Grade 6, which I play here without the accompaniment. It's often played by students on the string, but I think that bow has got to come off the string for the eighth-notes! For help with various kinds of spiccato, look at my #violinpracticetip series for several short  spiccato videos.{% endraw %}
