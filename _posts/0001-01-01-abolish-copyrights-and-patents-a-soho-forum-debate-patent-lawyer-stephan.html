Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.<br />----------------<br />The United States Constitution explicitly calls for copyright and patent laws to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful arts&quot; by &quot;authors and inventors.&quot; But would getting rid of all intellectual property laws actually encourage more creativity and innovation by inventors, writers, and artists?<br /><br />That was the topic of a November 15 Soho Forum debate held in New York City.<br /><br />Stephan Kinsella, who's spent 28 years as a practicing patent law attorney, argued in favor of the proposition that &quot;all patent and copyright law should be abolished.&quot;<br /><br />He believes that government-created intellectual property laws empower patent and copyright trolls and powerful corporate interests while limiting the free flow of information, thus reducing the rate of innovation and creativity.<br /><br />Richard Epstein, the Laurence A. Tisch professor of law at New York University School of Law, says that our current system isn't perfect but sees copyright and patents as a natural extension of private property rights and believes that it should be defended by libertarians accordingly.Â <br /><br />The debate took place in front of a live audience and was moderated by Soho Forum director Gene Epstein.<br /><br />Narrated by Nick Gillespie, edited by John Osterhoudt, produced by Caveat, photos by Brett Raney.{% endraw %}
