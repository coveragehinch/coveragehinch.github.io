{% raw %}All Rights Reserved to Disney.  This is the original scene with the original music (by Robert/Kristen Lopez and sung by Zoey Deschanel) from Winnie the Pooh (2011).  <br /><br />I OWN NOTHING.<br /><br />As far as I can tell Disney has yet to release singalong versions of any songs from Tangled except &quot;I See the Light&quot; and &quot;I've Got a Dream&quot; so I am posting these to try to fill that void.<br /><br />For anyone curious the font I am using for these Tangled vids is FairyTaleJF.  It's a shame that the actual Tangled inspired font that someone created was never finished and lacks at least half of the capital letters making it fairly unusable.{% endraw %}
