{% raw %}PEGGY LEE<br /><br /><br /><br />LYRICS:<br /><br />I'm feelin' mighty lonesome <br /><br />Haven't slept a wink <br /><br />I walk the floor from nine to four <br /><br />In between I drink <br /><br />Black coffee <br /><br />Love's a hand-me-down brew <br /><br />I'll never know a Sunday <br /><br />In this weekday room <br /><br /><br /><br />I'm talkin' to the shadow <br /><br />One o'clock 'til four <br /><br />And Lord, how slow the moments go <br /><br />And all I do is pour <br /><br />Black coffee <br /><br />Since the blues caught my eye <br /><br />I'm hangin' out on Monday <br /><br />My Sunday dreams to dry <br /><br /><br /><br />Now man was born to go a lovin' <br /><br />But was a woman born to weep and fret <br /><br />And stay at home and tend her oven <br /><br />And down her past regrets <br /><br />In coffee and cigarettes <br /><br /><br /><br />I'm moonin' all the mornin' <br /><br />Moanin' all the night <br /><br />And in between it's nicotine <br /><br />And not much heart to fight <br /><br />Black coffee <br /><br />Feelin' low as the ground <br /><br />It's drivin' me crazy <br /><br />This thinkin' 'bout my baby <br /><br />Might maybe come around <br /><br />Come around<br /><br /><br /><br />Artist: Peggy Lee<br /><br />Album: Black Coffee<br /><br />Year: 1953<br /><br />Song: Black Coffee{% endraw %}
