This film unpicks the most momentous days of Hitler's early life, each of which had a profound influence on his mental make-up. It begins with a look at the period when his ambitions to be an artist were crushed after he was rejected from an art academy. This set in motion a chain of events that led to further personal tragedies and triumphs as he became swept up in world events that seemed to be completely out of his control. The film gets under Hitler's skin to expose the seven most influential days of his life. It reveals how these seven days created the perfect personal storm which would create the FÃ¼hrer, the man who would lead the world into the most devastating war in history.<br /><br />This film was first broadcast: 18 Nov 2013<br /><br />Watch More Documentaries<br />Our Life - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3A8xRMJ">https://bit.ly/3A8xRMJ</a> <br />Our History - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3rUpdhL">https://bit.ly/3rUpdhL</a> <br />Our World - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ftuckM">https://bit.ly/3ftuckM</a> <br />Our Stories - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ynfFyk">https://bit.ly/3ynfFyk</a> <br /><br />Start your journey of discovery with Our History, as we bring you eye-opening documentaries and educational programmes about our world history.
