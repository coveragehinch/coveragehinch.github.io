{% raw %}Chainsaw Buying guide.  What size of chainsaw is best suited for you?<br /><br />Chainsaw's come in all different shapes and sizes, but what size is best for you?  There are several factors to consider, economics, land size, and primary use. <br /><br />Recommendations:<br /><br />Everyone - Husqvarna eSeries saws, like the Husqvarna 235e are terrific small saws that pack a big punch.  These saws are great for all users because of their power and maneuverability. <br /><br />Homeowner - Craftsman 16 Inch 42CC chainsaws are a great economical choice for homeowners that don't need a professional grade saw, but would like something strong and dependable. <br /><br />Farmer Rancher - Best all around chainsaw for landowners is probably the Husqvarna 450 Rancher.  This is a powerful saw but isn't too big to handle for most projects. <br /><br />Hardwood Firewood - Any of the Husqvarna Rancher series chainsaws. You need something with a little more power to cut up larger hardwood logs. <br /><br />Best Combination - It's often better to have two chainsaws, one for clean up and one for larger projects.  The Husqvarna 235e with a 14&quot; chain and bar is a great option for a small saw, and the Husqvarna 460 with a 24&quot; bar and chain is an ideal semi-professional chainsaw for the larger tasks.  The combination of these two saws can cover almost any task for large landowners. <br /><br />Economical Larger Saws - If you need to stay cheap, go old. Saws like the Craftsman 3.7 18&quot; 60CC are incredible older saws that have been built tough to last.  They may not have the RPMs of some newer saws, but they will outlast and thus outperform cheaper new saws.  Don't sacrifice quality for money if you don't have to.<br /><br />#chainsaw #husqvarna #craftsman #chainsawtips{% endraw %}
