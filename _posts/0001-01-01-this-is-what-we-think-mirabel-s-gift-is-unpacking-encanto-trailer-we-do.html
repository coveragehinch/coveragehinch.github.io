{% raw %}We do see Bruno in the trailer telling Mirabel that the fate of the family is going to come down to her, and it's interesting because Bruno doesn't seem &quot;evil&quot; when he's speaking, but maybe he leads Mirabel into a trap somehow? He's not on the family tree, so he could be trying to get revenge on his family for disowning him? I guess we'll have to see what happens when the movie is released in a couple of weeks!
