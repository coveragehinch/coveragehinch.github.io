As you put me to bed<br />I wouldn't just sleep, I'd dream to be half the man I saw you to be.<br />I'm proud to be your boy. I love I bring you joy.<br />And I'm honored one day, I get to do the same and pass on our last name.<br /><br />I'm proud to be your boy. I love I bring you joy.<br /> <br />All roads lead to roaming.<br />But I never would have grown if I never left home.<br /> <br />300 miles is nothing too far. In my life you're that guiding North Star.<br />You're here when I look in the mirror.<br />Everything you give for this family. Your wife and us three.<br />You live and you love true. <br />I can be just like you, cause father you used to be just like me.{% endraw %}
