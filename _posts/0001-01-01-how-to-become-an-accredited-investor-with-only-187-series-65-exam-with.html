These include bringing in an annual income of $200,000 or more for both of the last two years, or, having a net worth over $1 million, not including the value of your home.<br /><br />However, I recently learned of a new update to this rule that expands the definition of accredited investors, giving people access to the status without meeting the net worth or income requirements. With these changes, certain licensed professionals are now considered accredited investors regardless of their net worth or income. This is particularly exciting because this includes individuals who are Licensed Investment Advisor Representatives, or IARs, which requires passing the Series 65 exam.<br /><br />Unlike other licensing exams on this list, the series 65 exam is open to anybody, which means you can take it without any professional experience or affiliations.<br /><br />Let me clarify - anyone, regardless of education or professional experience, can sign up and pass the Series 65 exam to become a licensed investment advisor representative, and subsequently an accredited investor. The best part is, the exam only cost $187 at the time of writing. But, this isnâ€™t quite as easy as it sounds.<br /><br />In this video, Iâ€™m covering the step-by-step process of becoming an accredited investor through the Series 65 exam. It is true that you can get started with only $187, but the process might be longer and more expensive than you expect depending on how you approach it. It all starts with the Series 65 Exam, which as it turns out, might be the easy part of the process. After passing the exam, youâ€™ll need to register for your license to officially become accredited. This is easy for people working at an investment firm, but if youâ€™re someone like me who only wants the license for the accreditation, youâ€™ll have to create your own investment firm to register under. Weâ€™ll talk about the processes and costs involved in getting started this way, as well as how you maintain the status. Finally, weâ€™ll consider whether the designation of being an accredited investor is actually worth all the trouble. I personally sunk a couple hundred dollars into the process before I realized it wasnâ€™t the right path for me, so hopefully this video can help point you in the right direction of what to do next. <br /><br />#AccreditedInvestor #Investing #Series65<br /><br />â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢<br /><br />This video is meant for informational purposes only, and is not a recommendation to buy or sell any security or cryptocurrency.
