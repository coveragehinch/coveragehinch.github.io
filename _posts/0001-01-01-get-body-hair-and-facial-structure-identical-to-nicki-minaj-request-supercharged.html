How often do I need to listen to the subliminal?<br />As often as you like - the more the better. It’s entirely up to you. However, when using the subliminal as a dedication for change in your life, the most important thing is to set up a rhythm, listening for a set period at a certain time on the day. At least once a day is good for at least 30 mins. Your mind and body will become accustomed to the routine making it easier for you to relax and get the full benefits of the affirmation.<br /><br />2. I got this uncomfortable headache after listening to subliminal, what should I do?<br />The headache suggests that you are playing the audio too loudly or too loudly for your level of sensitivity to ultrasonic audio. Try dropping the volume 10% for an hour, and then see if the headache persists. If it does, drop it another 10% and repeat until the headache is gone.<br /><br />3. Why can’t I hear the affirmations/messages?<br />The messages are embedded in the music and beach waves at a level just below conscious perception. This is the nature of a subliminal recording.<br /><br />4. When is the best time to listen to the subliminal?<br />When you are most relaxed – in the morning or evening but you can pop them on anytime you feel is best.<br /><br />5. Can I listen to more than one subliminal in the same period?<br />Yes, you can – not at the same time but at different times in the same day or week.<br /><br />6. Can I play them while going to sleep?<br />Yes certainly. Some people like to play them at very low volume while sleeping.<br /><br />7. Can I play them while working or going about my business in the home?<br />Yes.<br /><br />8. Do I need to use headphones?<br />No, it's not necessary.<br /><br />9. How long will I have to listen to the subliminal before I experience any results?<br />Some people will get results right away – for others, it may be weeks.<br /><br />+------------------------------+<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This subliminal doesn't substitute any type of professional healthcare and all of my subliminal are permanent.<br /><br />Become a Patron and support the channel for $1<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ancientpower">https://www.patreon.com/ancientpower</a><br /><br />WARNING!<br />This subliminal contains frequencies, make sure you listen at a comfortable volume. Exposure to loud frequencies over a long period could damage your hearing, I'd highly recommend listening at 25% - 40%.<br /><br />Tags:<br />#Subliminal #NickiMinaj #AncientPower{% endraw %}
