{% raw %}A Toyota Master Diagnostic Technician covers Essential Mechanic Tools for DIY mechanics and Beginner mechanics in the field. These are recommendations specific to working on Toyota, Lexus and Scion products.<br /><br />I made a list of some tool recommendations in my amazon affiliate store which can be found in the link below:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/shop/thecarcarenut">http://www.amazon.com/shop/thecarcarenut</a><br />*as an Amazon associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.<br /><br />In this much requested video by my viewers and patreon community I'll cover the very basics of tools. There's no way I can cover every single little detail of tools as tools have somewhat of a personal touch but I tried my best to convey as much information as possible in a single video which will help you make better decisions when it comes to tools.<br /><br />I am a big advocate of experience over tools. I see this in the shop where the mechanics that do the least amount of work have the most amount of tools and the mechanics that do the biggest jobs have the least amount of tools. This theory only works in a single brand dealership. Mechanics in independent shops are forced to have a very large tool set because of the nature of their work.<br /><br />DIY mechanics often start with the most basic tools and end up over buying or buying the incorrect sets and finding out later they need more tools. If you already know which type of cars you'll be working on you'll be able to narrow down which key tools you need to have in a particular set you're buying.<br /><br />Follow the channel on Social Media :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/thecarcarenut">http://www.facebook.com/thecarcarenut</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/thecarcarenut">http://www.instagram.com/thecarcarenut</a><br /><br />Check out the channel Merch store<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKt2bUDBoRUw3wpPpDOUaA/store">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKt2bUDBoRUw3wpPpDOUaA/store</a><br /><br />Support the channel on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/thecarcarenut">http://www.patreon.com/thecarcarenut</a><br /><br />Make a one time donation to the channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.paypal.me/CCNdonate">http://www.paypal.me/CCNdonate</a><br /><br />Check out the amazon store:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/shop/thecarcarenut">http://www.amazon.com/shop/thecarcarenut</a><br />*as an Amazon associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.<br /><br />#thecarcarenut #toyotamechanic #toyota #lexus #tools<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:42 Tools Overview<br />2:02 Basic Hand Tools : Sockets<br />8:36 Power Tools<br />15:34 Wrenches<br />20:14 Pliers and Screwdrivers<br />21:52 More Tool Recommendations<br />23:28 So which brand should you buy?{% endraw %}
