{% raw %}Today was a BIG day in Escape from Tarkov we got the first iteration of daily quests as a surprise and they are very intriquite. We also got a lot of new info and specifics from Nikita, the lead dev from Battlestate Games during a community livestream with Lvndmark, Glorious, HyperRat, Gingy and RedSeven. The next Tarkov Wipe was accidentally confirmed by Nikita in this cast. <br />Podcast Vod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1183927747">https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1183927747</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Become a FORNICATING Member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3eQQmMw">https://bit.ly/3eQQmMw</a><br />JOIN THE DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/noiceguys">https://discord.com/invite/noiceguys</a><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3077dnz">https://bit.ly/3077dnz</a><br />LATEST Tarkov News: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/39XY1Yo">http://bit.ly/39XY1Yo</a><br />EFT Like a PRO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2YVPEGs">http://bit.ly/2YVPEGs</a><br />Support the Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/noiceguy">https://ko-fi.com/noiceguy</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Although I do sometimes get a hand from BSG and occasionally get to talk to Nikita or other members of the team, I do not work for BSG. I also work entirely off public information and past experiences of working in game dev myself, as well as following this game closely for several years. Unless I state very clearly otherwise, the information you're about to hear should be taken as speculation. You can either get no information or speculation, that's all we have to go off of these days unfortunately which is why it's easier to just say Thursday whenever anyone asks for dates. If you want hard facts and dates you won't get them, period.{% endraw %}
