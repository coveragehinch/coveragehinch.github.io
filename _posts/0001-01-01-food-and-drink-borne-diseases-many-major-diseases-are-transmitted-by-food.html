{% raw %}Many major diseases are transmitted by food or drink. Cholera (water), brucellosis (milk), BSE/nvCJD, typhoid and many parasites are ingested as part of a normal diet. The more exotic the diet, the greater the range of possible infections. Water technology, sanitation, pasteurisation and animal husbandry can substantially reduce but not eliminate these diseases.<br /><br />A lecture by Chris Whitty<br /><br />The transcript and downloadable versions of the lecture are available from the Gresham College website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/food-diseases">https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/food-diseases</a><br /><br />Gresham College has offered free public lectures for over 400 years, thanks to the generosity of our supporters.
