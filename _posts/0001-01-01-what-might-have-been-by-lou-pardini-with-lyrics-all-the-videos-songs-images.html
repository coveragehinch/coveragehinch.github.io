What might have been<br />Trace of forever lingering<br />Drawing me closer to you<br />A new beginning<br />Now I know<br />There is no doubt<br />I understand<br />Just how fragile love can be<br />I can't forget<br />Your memory found me<br />Now I know where I belong...<br />I'm ready this time<br />I know that I'm<br />No longer undecided<br />Don't want to be a fool wondering...<br />... What might have been<br />Through every day<br />And into the night<br />With only love to guide us<br />I'm ready to go<br />'Cause I've got to know...<br />What might have been<br />Let the lovin' decide<br />I can't run I can't hide...<br />I want you to know<br />My heart will show<br />That I'm...<br />Ready this time<br />I know that I'm<br />No longer undecided<br />Don't want to be a fool wondering...<br />... What might have been<br />I've searched everywhere<br />And nothing compares<br />When we've got love to guide us<br />I'm ready to go<br />I've got to know...<br />What might have been<br />I'm wondering...<br />What might have been<br />I want to know<br />What might have been<br />We're gonna find<br />What might have been<br />Oh... I want to know<br />What might have been<br />Oh...<br />What might have been<br />We're gonna find<br />What might have been<br />I want to know<br />What might have been<br />... What might have been...{% endraw %}
