To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid tiny house that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. Hit with constant delays and building price increases, realizing our dream of building our own home has taken longer than anticipated. With travel starting to reopen again, we've learned so much about the importance of having a home base. and are excited to continue our build this dream here while also doing what we love most, exploring and seeing the world!<br /><br />More about AG: <br />Athletic Greens is multiple nutritional supplements bundled into an ultimate all-in-one nutritional formula.
