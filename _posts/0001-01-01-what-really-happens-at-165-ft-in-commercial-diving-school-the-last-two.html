{% raw %}The last two weeks of training and certification to be a commercial diver at CDA Technical Institute take place at our Deep Water Training Facility in Ocala, Florida. This is when the students get a chance to experience a real world work environment and test out what it is like to really go deep water diving in a dry suit. While we would like to claim that it is all hard work to be a commercial diver we wanted to show you what really happens at 165 ft at the CDA Deep Water Training Center in Ocala, Florida!<br /><br />Find out more about CDA Technical Institute here:<br />Commercial Diving<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cda-socialmedia.com/cdaguide">https://www.cda-socialmedia.com/cdaguide</a><br />Welding:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cda-socialmedia.com/weldingprogram">https://www.cda-socialmedia.com/weldingprogram</a><br />Veterans:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cda-socialmedia.com/optin19185812">https://www.cda-socialmedia.com/optin19185812</a><br /><br />Follow us on:<br />Facebook:<br />CDA Commercial Diving: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CDA.EDU/">https://www.facebook.com/CDA.EDU/</a><br />CDA Welding: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/WeldingProgram/">https://www.facebook.com/WeldingProgram/</a><br />Twitter: @CDATechnical<br />Instagram: CDATech<br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CDA8137">https://www.youtube.com/user/CDA8137</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cdatech/">https://www.instagram.com/cdatech/</a>{% endraw %}
