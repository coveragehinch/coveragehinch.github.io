It’s actually not a diet with restrictive rules. Founded by Gwen Shamblin Lara, this program focuses on your connection with God not the food. Thousands of people have kept their weight off permanently by following the principles of Weigh Down. Gwen received her undergraduate degree in Dietetics and Master’s Degree in Nutrition with an emphasis in Biochemistry from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. Her first book The Weigh Down Diet was published by Doubleday, Inc. The book quickly became a million-seller as people discovered the secrets to losing weight quickly and permanently while finding a new relationship with God. Gwen Shamblin Lara has appeared on The Today Show, Tyra, Larry King Live, 20/20 and The View. Weigh Down has been featured in Good Housekeeping, Ladies Home Journal, People, Prevention, and Woman's Day. Gwen’s dream of helping people turn away from the love of food and toward a love of God has turned into a ministry and continues even stronger today. Through Weigh Down Workshop classes, Weigh Down Radio, You Can Overcome Shows, books and audios, thousands of people are ending their struggle with overweight and the pain of addictive strongholds. Weigh Down works!{% endraw %}
