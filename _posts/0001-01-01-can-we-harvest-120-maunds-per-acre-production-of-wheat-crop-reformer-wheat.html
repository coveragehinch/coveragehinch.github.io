{% raw %}Wheat is the most important of the cereal crops worldwide. It is a staple food of people of Pakistan and grown on millions of acres every year. Current cultivated wheat varieties and recommended production technology have the potential of sixty to seventy maunds under our present agricultural and climatic / weather conditions. Production of one hundred and twenty maunds wheat by making use of seed rate of fifty kg in not possible with current conditions. Because so thickly populated crop has a higher tendency of lodging in case of high inputs in the form of fertilizers like dap fertilizer (diammonium phosphate, diammonium phosphate fertilizer, mono ammonium phosphate, monoammonium phosphate fertilizer), SOP fertilizer (sulphate of potash, potassium sulfate fertilizer, potassium sulphate fertilizer, sulphate of potash fertilizer, sulphate of potash price ,Urea fertilizer and resource management practices. However, if it is cultivated through spaced planting method along the sides of the beds, very high fertilizer inputs are applied and short statured varieties are developed, then 120 maunds per acre yield can be obtained. By making use of modern machines and other agricultural machinery, we can enhance the overall yield potential of our current varieties of wheat crop. Technical reasoning of this statement according to our ground realities have been given in this video.<br /><br />#Wheat<br />#CropReformer{% endraw %}
