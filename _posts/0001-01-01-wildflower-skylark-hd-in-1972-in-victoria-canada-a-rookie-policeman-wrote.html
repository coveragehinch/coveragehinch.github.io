Dave &quot;the Cop&quot; Richardson gave the poem to his friend David Foster, a young aspiring young musician looking for material for his new band, SKYLARK. Foster passed it along to Skylark guitarist Doug Edwards who set it to music. It was the first song Edwards had ever composed.<br /><br /><br /><br />WILDFLOWER is one of the most performed songs in the history of Canadian popular music.
