{% raw %}Today weâ€™re going to review Somiâ€™s comeback with XOXO, weâ€™ll tackle why itâ€™s familiar, my thoughts on the music video, the song, and honestly everything in between. <br /><br />Somi recently came out with her first album, also titled XOXO and featured all the songs sheâ€™s released since debut from Birthday to What you Waiting for and of course Dumb Dumb. And though sheâ€™s under the black label, I feel as though sheâ€™s starting more and more to get comfortable with her own sound, which I would describe as angsty teen crush. And this era in particular of Somi seems more refined, more detailed and even grungier than before, so Iâ€™m really excited to get into it. <br /><br />Jay B ''B.T.W&quot; &amp; SOMI ''XOXO'' Comparison<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/fpW0VUwCZD8">https://youtu.be/fpW0VUwCZD8</a><br /><br />âœ§<br /><br />ðŸ’— CONNECT WITH ME ðŸ’—<br />MEMBERSHIPS Â» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2WNCVWo">https://bit.ly/2WNCVWo</a><br />INSTAGRAM Â» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/moluccensis/">https://www.instagram.com/moluccensis/</a><br />2ND CHANNEL Â» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/angelina2">https://www.youtube.com/c/angelina2</a><br />BUSINESS Â» moluccensis@aol.com<br /><br />become a COCKA2 by subscribing to my channel 'angelina' &amp; hit the bell for more kpop shenanigans Â» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Boj1bW">https://bit.ly/2Boj1bW</a><br /><br />âœ§<br /><br />ðŸ’— CREDITS ðŸ’—<br />OUTRO Â»  vhs - montreal <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/sDTJU2Aqhlg">https://youtu.be/sDTJU2Aqhlg</a><br /><br />FUNKY TRANSITION Â» Kpop Shake<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3672GCK">https://bit.ly/3672GCK</a><br /><br />âœ§<br /><br />Timestamps<br />0:00 Intro<br />1:33 MV Explained<br />7:10 MV Similarities<br />9:43 TeddyApologizeToJayB<br />11:01 Song Review<br />13:48 the Choreography<br /><br />#JEONSOMI #ì „ì†Œë¯¸ #JEONSOMI_XOXO{% endraw %}
