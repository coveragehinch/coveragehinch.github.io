{% raw %}In our video &quot;Food Chain for Kids&quot; we learn all about the different food chains and food webs. All of us eat.  You may eat meat or only eat vegetables but one way or another every living thing eats. When you eat something it gives you energy. In a way, the energy comes from the food you eat, but the energy actually came from the Sun first. You are simply the last organism in the food chain to eat the food. A food chain is a path that energy takes from producers to consumers all the way down to decomposers.<br /><br />Throughout this fun scientific video we will will walk with you through the energy cycle... from the sun to plants, plants to animals and humans, and much more!  We will learn about producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, and decomposers and how each of these living things play an important role in the food chain. <br /><br />If you're looking for even more food chain resources we invite you to download our comprehensive 9 page food chain lesson plan that comes with more content pages, worksheets, food chain activities and more!
