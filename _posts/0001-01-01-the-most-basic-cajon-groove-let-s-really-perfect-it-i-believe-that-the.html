{% raw %}I believe that the very first groove you learn to play on the cajon is beautiful in its simplicity. Having a good feel for basic cajon grooves is such a valuable skill that I wanted to share that feeling with you. A good understanding of how to subdivide notes and properly count music is also essential for our job. So in this video, you'll learn what 8th and 16th notes are and hear how they both sound against the same piece of music. There are 4 tracks that we'll play in this video ranging from 60bpm (a good goal speed for a beginner) and 120bpm (a nice challenge for an intermediate player).  <br /><br />üè°10min Practice Tracks, Complete Courses &amp; More: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/rosslmccallum/join">https://www.youtube.com/rosslmccallum/join</a><br /> <br />üëãDiscord Community:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/cpmsA6k">https://discord.gg/cpmsA6k</a><br /><br />üëïTeespring Store:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rosslmccallum">https://teespring.com/stores/rosslmccallum</a><br /><br />üìïChapters:<br />0:00 - Welcome to another cajon lesson<br />0:39 - Counting and subdividing<br />2:07 - Basic 8th note groove (beginner goal tempo)<br />3:39 - How to get from 8ths to 16ths<br />4:23 - Basic 16th note groove (beginner goal tempo)<br />5:56 - One tempo, two subdivisions<br />6:39 - Basic 8th note groove at 80bpm<br />7:31 - Basic 16th note groove at 80bpm<br />8:31 - Basic 8th note groove at 100bpm<br />9:15 - Basic 16th note groove at 100bpm<br />9:59 - Which subdivision feels best?<br />10:27 - Basic 8th note groove at 120bpm<br />11:03 - Basic 16th note groove at 120bpm<br />11:42 - Good simplicity is an art<br /><br />üõíEquipment:<br />Cajon Backpack - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bW8qEC">https://amzn.to/3bW8qEC</a><br />MEINL Artisan Cajons - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/390GIW7">http://amzn.to/390GIW7</a><br />Audix D6 Mic - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39ScSC6">https://amzn.to/39ScSC6</a><br />Audix i5 Mic - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35TOJKo">https://amzn.to/35TOJKo</a><br />Beyerdynamic DT770 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39Hsmc4">https://amzn.to/39Hsmc4</a> <br /><br />üé¨About My Channel:<br />High quality cajon lessons for beginners, intermediate and advanced players.
