{% raw %}It's finally Christmas!! I’m definitely the “Christmas Music Before Thanksgiving'' kind of person… and with all the holiday spirit, it has me beyond excited! Special thanks to Canon for partnering with me on this video!  ✅ The EOS M50 Mark II Content Creator Kit I am giving Rylan is CURRENTLY $100 OFF until 12/12/21! 👉🏻 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.canon.us/kamri">http://www.canon.us/kamri</a><br /><br />As a college student, holidays also mean finals, so I’m soaking up all the positive vibes I can get, wherever I can get them! This last week, I flew home and FINALLY got to see my family after several months! Rylan gets excited anytime I come home… though she won’t say it out loud.😉  She always volunteers to pick me up at the airport, even though I fly in at 1am every time. That ought to tell you how much we enjoy each other, right?<br /><br />In our family, it seems Rylan and I always get stuck wrapping all the presents for the entire family. It was because our parents offered to pay any kid for each present that we wrapped, so Rylan and I were always the first to volunteer and wrapped the fastest, since we liked earning/saving money. So we decided to get a head start on it all this year! Plus, I got Rylan a SPECIAL GIFT this year that I wanted to keep a secret (she won’t watch this vid haha trust me), so the earlier we get it wrapped, the better! When Rylan stepped out, I show you her special gift!<br /><br />I also asked y'all to share your favorite funny family holiday memories and MAN y'all have some crazy stuff going on hahaha! I thought our family stories were crazy until I heard many of yours!
