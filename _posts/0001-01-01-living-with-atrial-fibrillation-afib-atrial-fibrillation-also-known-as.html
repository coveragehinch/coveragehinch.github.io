{% raw %}Atrial Fibrillation, also known as AFib, is the most common type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat. An estimated 5 million Americans are currently living with AFib, and it becomes more common with age. AFib significantly increases a person’s risk of stroke, so it’s important to recognize its signs and symptoms and to seek treatment to reduce risk.  However, it’s important to keep in mind that some people with AFib never experience symptoms, and are diagnosed when a health care professional detects an irregular heartbeat during a routine exam or during a visit for another health condition.  Watch this short film to learn about the risk factors, causes, symptoms, and treatment options of AFib.
