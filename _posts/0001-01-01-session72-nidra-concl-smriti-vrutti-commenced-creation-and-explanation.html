{% raw %}Creation and explanation of creation<br />1. According to science<br />2. According to mysticism. Swapna sṛṣti. In dream state the formations of images are not real but like a laser show. The material of these objects is not physical as in our physical world. They are only light effects. Hence it is Prajñya. Dreamless sleep=nidrāvastha.<br />3. Acc to Vyasa: 'sukham' is the reason why we say &quot;I had a very good sleep&quot;. So what is that sukha? It is the embrace with the divine. Wealth, gold and diamonds cannot give that happiness and delight that sleep can bring. No one will be ready to exchange wealth for giving up sleep. Sleep is a date for the essential ‘I’ with the beloved which is divinity. This brings an enormous degree of happiness. This is Brahmananda, which is beyond the joys of heaven. It is beyond the pleasures of the terrestrial plains. This happens in swapna s̍ṛṣti.<br />4. Quotes from: Kaivalya Upaniṣad; Bruhudāraṇya Upaniṣad; Sāṅkhya sūtra.<br />5. In state of sleep, we go to the abode of the creator. But gross body (sthula s̍arīra) is unable to realise or recognise this difference because it is boxed in its own limited conditioning, a sleepy state. But the kārana (causal) and sukṣma (subtle) s̍arīra takes a dip into that bliss of going to the divine abode and enjoys enormous delight and joy in the dreamless sleep. Therefore, dreamless seep is not a state of void.<br />6. S̍ramaṇa siddhanta: Theory of fatigue. Sleep due to tiredness of body or of intellect, of senses. Laya siddhānata: Theory of absorption. Subtle getting absorbed into subtler and subtler till everything is absorbed in prāṇa. Prāṇa is the dissolvent.<br />7 Smṛti: it is not memory as misunderstood by most.{% endraw %}
