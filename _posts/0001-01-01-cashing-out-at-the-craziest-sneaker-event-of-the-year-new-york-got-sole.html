We traveled from Phoenix/Tempe Arizona all the way to New York / New Jersey to come cash out and buy sneakers at the second Got Sole, which was the craziest sneaker event of the year for us. Our main buys in this video are the Off White Nike Dunk Low &quot;Lots&quot;,  Nike Dunk Low Panda or Black / White, Jordan 1 Mocha,  Jordan 1 Low Starfish, Nike Dunk Low University Red and more. Sellers and vendors at GotSole were charging decent prices. We were able to cash out or buy $8,000 worth of sneakers for STEALS, and we show you / give you sneaker reselling advice on how. Watch the full video to find out what we bought at New York Got Sole and the prices we paid. This was one of our favorite and funniest sneaker lowballing segments thus far. We also gave tons of resell advice and tips in this video. We will be at  SneakerCon Phoenix this next weekend. The sneakers and clothing we pick up are our best selling sneakers in our sneaker store. We hope you all enjoy the videos and thank you for the continued support!<br /><br />If you guys are in the Phoenix, Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Tempe or Scottsdale area in Arizona, come check out our shop located in Tempe!<br /><br />Help me hit 20K followers on Instagram<br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thecommonhype/">https://www.instagram.com/thecommonhype/</a><br />Store IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/commonhypeaz/">https://www.instagram.com/commonhypeaz/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/thecommonhype">https://twitter.com/thecommonhype</a><br />Cook Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thegoodchefs/">https://www.instagram.com/thegoodchefs/</a><br /><br />Music By: Valious and Depo on the Beat{% endraw %}
