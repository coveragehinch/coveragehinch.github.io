{% raw %}In the brief video, Hunter Smith demonstrates the power and simplicity of the Elasticity Toolkit, developed by Timothy Straiton.<br /><br />The Elasticity toolkit was created to obtain maximum gains in both sideways and trending markets with minimum risk. Developed by Timothy Straiton, the system performs with incredible results in almost all equity markets with a daily periodicity.<br /><br />The Elasticity trading system focuses on short-term market fluctuations and takes advantage of deviation or &quot;elasticity&quot; from the mean price. Imagine the action of a rubber band being stretched and at the moment where the expansion loses momentum, a contraction takes place, forcing movement in the opposite direction. The Elasticity trading system signals a trade at the moment the deviation from the mean loses momentum.{% endraw %}
