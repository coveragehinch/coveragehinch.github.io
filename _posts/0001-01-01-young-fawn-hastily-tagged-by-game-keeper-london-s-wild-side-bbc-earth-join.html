But looking again, with the right eyes, you can see that nature is actually here in abundance. This surprising film meets the people who have followed their own call of the wild to establish relationships with city animals, and meets those creatures that have adapted to thrive in this urban jungle.<br /><br />Welcome to BBC EARTH! The world is an amazing place full of stories, beauty and natural wonder. Here you'll find 50 years worth of entertaining and thought-provoking natural history content. Dramatic, rare, and exclusive, nature doesn't get more exciting than this.<br /><br />This is a commercial channel from BBC Studios.
