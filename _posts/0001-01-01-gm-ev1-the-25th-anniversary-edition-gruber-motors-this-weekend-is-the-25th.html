{% raw %}This weekend is the 25th Anniversary of the short lived General Motors electric vehicle, the EV1.<br /><br />Our video is a tribute to this groundbreaking car, and a short historical account of why it no longer exists.<br /><br />The EV1 was a short-lived GM attempt at mass producing an electric vehicle, after developing a proof of concept Impact EV.  <br /><br />Continuing production, could have placed GM in the forefront of the EV revolution, a distinction that ended up going to Tesla, who had more vision, and saw the future much more clearly than GM.<br /><br />For reasons still hotly debated, GM refused to sell this electric sedan, allowing only leasing, and after a few years, recalled almost all of them, and crushed them here in Arizona, despite strong protests from owners who loved the cars, and wanted to buy them.<br /><br />Ironically, decades later, GM finally seems to understand where the future in transportation is going, and pledges to now convert to 100% EV production by 2035.<br /><br />The video references our tZero video link which can be viewed:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0-z423zPswc">https://youtu.be/0-z423zPswc</a><br /><br />For more information on what we do here at Gruber Motor Company, please visit our website at: <br />www.grubermotors.com<br /><br />You can also check us out on our Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok pages below. <br /><br />Instagram<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/grubermotorcompany/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/grubermotorcompany/?hl=en</a><br /><br />TikTok<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@grubermotorcompany?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@grubermotorcompany?lang=en</a><br /><br />Facebook<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.facebook.com/pages/category/Personal-Blog/Gruber-Motor-Company-103041371349271/">https://m.facebook.com/pages/category/Personal-Blog/Gruber-Motor-Company-103041371349271/</a><br /><br />#tesla #gm #ev1 #grubermotors{% endraw %}
