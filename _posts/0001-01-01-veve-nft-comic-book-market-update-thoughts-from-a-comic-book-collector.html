{% raw %}In this video I revisit my NFT Comic Book Portfolio and give my updated opinion on the VEVE NFT Marketplace. I very much enjoy the NFT world - though for me I'm just having fun with it as opposed to going &quot;all in&quot; as far as an investment is concerned. But it is really cool to see how much my portfolio has grown. Having only put $120 into the app I currently have over $700 of equity. That's a pretty ridiculous gain of 7x in only 3 months time. Even though I am mostly sticking to the &quot;blue chip grails&quot; when it comes to Veve buying, I will 100% be picking up the Darkhawk #1 drop for myself just because I'm such a fan. What are you guys' current thoughts on Veve and Digital Comics?<br /><br />Hope you enjoy the video!<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br /><br />0:10 - Intro<br />1:07 - What Is Veve?
