{% raw %}It's February...how's your New Year's Resolution going? A lot of people want to eat better, so they decide to do a new diet, and the one you're probably tired of hearing about (or tired of hearing other people tell you how it's garbage while you're losing weight) is the Keto Diet. Well, one of the things people on the KETO diet do is remove carbs by replacing them with healthy alternatives. Then someone said &quot;Hey, Let's make fake noodles using zuchinni!&quot;<br /><br />You've seen Spiralizers for a long time and frankly, they're dumb. I wanted to try some zoodles using a simple, small gadget that wouldn't take up much space in my kitchen cabinet or drawer. So, I bought the OXO Hand-Held Spiralizer.<br /><br />If you're on Keto, should you get one of these? Let me know what you think in the comments.<br /><br />******<br />OXO Hand-Held Spiralizer - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WsMwzc">https://amzn.to/2WsMwzc</a><br />******<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/randoreviews1">http://www.twitter.com/randoreviews1</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/randoreviews1">http://www.facebook.com/randoreviews1</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/randoreviews1">http://www.twitch.tv/randoreviews1</a>{% endraw %}
