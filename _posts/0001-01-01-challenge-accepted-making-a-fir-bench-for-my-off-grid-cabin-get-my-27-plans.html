{% raw %}Get My 27 Plans Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rlnk.cc/27plansthesamuraicarpenter">https://rlnk.cc/27plansthesamuraicarpenter</a><br /><br />Thanks for the challenge Jon Peters!  This bench turned out amazing and I can’t wait to take it up to my off grid property.  I used Douglas fir to build this bench and it will fit in well with my off-grid cabin.  You can get Jon’s plans for his original design of this bench as well as his full video tutorials through the link above at the Makers Mob!
