{% raw %}Title: The Crowd<br />Year of Release: 1928<br />Director: King Vidor <br /><br />The Crowd is one of my favorite silent films of all time. Nominated for the  Academy Award for Unique and Artistic Production and being one of the first films selected for preservation in the National Film registry, The Crowd deals with the dangers of the urban life. MGM was skeptical that a story about ordinary people could be successful at the box office. However, the film ended up making back twice what it cost to make it. The story deals with John Sims and his struggle to be somebody and make it to the top while living among the crowd of people in NYC.<br /><br />This scene serves as an introduction to King Vidor's vision of what was then modern day New York. It does a great job in showing the viewer the environment that John will have to contend with throughout the movie. Although a short scene, I always saw it as a very important one to the film. It's also one of my favorite scenes in the movie.{% endraw %}
