{% raw %}In this new video you are not going to see clips, but just one solid video of this Cuterebra that has grown much to occupy a large space in this Maltese dog's foot. Something unusual happened while taking this Cuterebra out is due to the pressure is has been put on it, it has popped up and a liquid came out of it, the vet tech then was fast enough to remove the hard rest of it before it gets inside and would be hard to get it out.<br /><br />See more of this veterinary association here, and more animal's rescues from it:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/johnstownvets">https://instagram.com/johnstownvets</a><br />Note: All Videos Here On This Channel Have Been Allowed To Be Uploaded On It(except Commentary, it's Original And Added By Me With My Own Voice)<br /><br />Love Animals?
