{% raw %}Join my British Pronunciation Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etjenglish.com">https://www.etjenglish.com</a><br /><br /><br />Learn how to pronounce these two easily confused short vowels,  /Ã¦/ and /e/. A lot of my students don't even know they make mistakes with these two sounds, so this modern RP British pronunciation lesson will be very important for all accent enthusiasts<br /><br /><br />Remember, you don't NEED an RP British accent to speak English well (or even an English accent at all!). There are loads of accents out there! I'm just here to help people who have a love for modern versions of RP and want to speak it clearly.<br /><br />DONATE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=CH4W5T79WQCZY">https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=CH4W5T79WQCZY</a><br />Your kind donations help me upload videos frequently, thank you ðŸ–¤<br /><br />MY PODCAST: Search &quot;Journeys With Elliott&quot; on your favourite app Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0PQ46j8...â€‹">https://open.spotify.com/show/0PQ46j8...â€‹</a> <br /><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/etjenglishâ€‹">https://www.facebook.com/etjenglishâ€‹</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/etjenglishâ€‹">https://www.twitter.com/etjenglishâ€‹</a><br /> Instagram: @etjenglish (this is where I am most active!){% endraw %}
