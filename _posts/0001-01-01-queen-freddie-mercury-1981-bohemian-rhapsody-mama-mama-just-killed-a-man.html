{% raw %}Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head,<br />Pulled my trigger now he's dead<br />Mama, life had just begun<br />But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br /><br />Mama oooh... Didn't mean to make you cry<br />If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br />Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters<br /><br />Too late, my time has come, sends shivers down my spine<br />Body's aching all the time<br />Goodbye everybody, I've got to go<br />Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br />Mama oooh (any way the wind blows)<br />I don't want to die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all<br /><br />I see a little silhouetto of a man<br />Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the Fandango<br />Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening thing<br />Galileo (Galileo)<br />Galileo (Galileo)<br />Galileo figaro (Magnifico)<br />But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me<br />He's just a poor boy from a poor family<br />Spare him his life from this monstrosity<br />Easy come, easy go, will you let me go<br />Bismillah! No, we will not let you go, let him go<br />Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go<br />Bismillah! We will not let you go, let me go<br />Will not let you go, let me go<br />Will not let you go let me go<br />No, no, no, no, no, no, no<br />Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go<br />Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me<br /><br />So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye<br />So you think you can love me and leave me to die<br />Oh baby, can't do this to me baby<br />Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here<br /><br />Nothing really matters, anyone can see<br />Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me<br />Any way the wind blows.{% endraw %}
