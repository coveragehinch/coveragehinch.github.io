{% raw %}In this video, I will show you a couple of methods to compare two Excel sheets for differences or compare two Excel files.<br /><br />There are some in-built features in Excel, such as View side-by-side and New Window that make the comparison of sheets easy. It allows you to open each sheet as a separate file and view these side-by-side.<br /><br />This is a good method when you want to manually compare the sheets.<br /><br />In case you have huge datasets, you can also use the conditional formatting method, or the formula method covered in this video.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:27 Compare Two Sheets in Different Excel Workbooks<br />03:48 Compare Two Excel Sheets in the Same Workbook<br />07:14 Compare Two Sheets in Highlight Differences<br />11:03 Compare Sheets in Fetch the Differences<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Subscribe to this YouTube channel to get updates on Excel Tips and Excel Tutorials videos - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/trumpexcel">https://www.youtube.com/c/trumpexcel</a><br /><br />This YouTube channel is managed by Sumit Bansal (who also runs the TrumpExcel website). <br /><br />This channel is meant for people who want to learn Excel.
