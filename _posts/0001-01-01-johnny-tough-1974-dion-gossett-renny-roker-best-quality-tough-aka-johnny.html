{% raw %}Tough! (aka Johnny Tough) holds special memories for those who saw it during its original release. There has never been an official home video release.  The opening song, &quot;Capricorn's Theme&quot; and three other tunes that appear in the movie were composed and performed by Dennis Coffey And The Detroit Guitar Band (Black Belt Jones) and appear on their 1973 LP, Electric Coffey . The closing song, We The People, is a remix of the title track from The Soul Searchers (feat Chuck Brown)’s debut LP from 1972.<br /><br /> This upload was transferred from Charles Wood’s personal 35mm archival print and is shared for historical purposes. I do not own the rights.<br /><br />#####<br /><br />Johnny (Dion Gossett) continually rebels against the white establishment. The boy finds he can expect no back-up of his attitude at home, where his parents wallow in self-indulgence, so he feels that a show of force is his only option. Written &amp; directed by Horace Jackson (The Bus Is Coming).  - IMDb<br /><br />Great article by Michael Gonzales about the film <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ebony.com/entertainment/blaxploitation-johnny-tough/#axzz4AZGV9kiv">https://www.ebony.com/entertainment/blaxploitation-johnny-tough/#axzz4AZGV9kiv</a><br /><br />#####<br />Reelblack's mission is to educate, elevate, entertain enlighten, and empower through Black film.
