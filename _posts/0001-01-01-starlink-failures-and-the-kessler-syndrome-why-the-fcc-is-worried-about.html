{% raw %}SpaceX is launching the largest constellation of satellites in history. Every time one of those satellites fails, there is a concern that a failed satellite could hit something else in space causing a field of debris. If there is enough debris it can lead to an effect called the Kessler Syndrome - a runaway cascadde of collissions that could fill Low Earch Orbit with debris for years!<br /><br />References:<br />European Space Agency, Time to Act: Credit: ESA â€“ CC BY-SA IGO 3.0 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/igo/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/igo/</a><br />FCC File: SATMOD2020041700037 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-MOD-20200417-00037">https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-MOD-20200417-00037</a><br /><br />Contents:<br />0:00 Intro to the Kessler Syndrome<br />0:34 SpaceX Authorizations and Modification with the FCC<br />1:32 SpaceX's BIGGEST change to Starlink<br />2:43 Starlink Failures<br />3:23 The Kessler Syndrome!<br />4:03 Starlink Failure Analysis<br />6:16 Starlink Maneuvering without Propulsion<br />7:16 Why is everyone objecting to Starlink?<br />7:58 SmallSat videos?<br />8:17 ESA Time to Act<br />8:38 Closing<br /><br />#SpaceX #Starlink #KesslerSyndrome{% endraw %}
