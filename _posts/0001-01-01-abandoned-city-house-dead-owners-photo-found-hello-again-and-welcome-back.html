{% raw %}Hello again and welcome back to another video! Read Below :)<br /><br />The tenant lived in the upper floor of the house and was forced to leave because of the bad condition of the house, and Pentti, last resident of the house was so old and also in a bad condition that he was no longer a housekeeper or landlord. He died in old age and the house was left to the children. children did not care about the plot or renovation of the house and they sold the house after many many years to the city. The city will build an apartment building on this plot soon.<br /><br />Visitors' book from -96 says 01:46:<br />We came to Pentti's house to the evening cafe straight from the mushroom forest. (Was not much mushrooms). Kaisa said Pentti's garden was &quot;a paradise in the middle of the city&quot;. We also heard that there has been &quot;snake&quot; in the Paradise. We planned to go to the Suvis cottage. More stuff after a trip!  -Kaisa and Matti and &quot;Kessu&quot; )maybe a dog?)<br /><br />Photo of Pentti: 02:58<br />Photo of &quot;Paradice in the city&quot;: 02:14<br /><br />- Checkout my Instagram:<br />- INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/Exploringwithpertti">https://instagram.com/Exploringwithpertti</a><br /><br />Want to make an Donation?<br />www.paypal.me/perttivaris<br />Thank you!{% endraw %}
