{% raw %}No seasoning required! Nonstick cookware companies don't want you to know this trick. Heating a pan properly is the easiest way to cook eggs on stainless steel cookware without sticking, and allows us to ditch the toxic nonstick&quot; cookware that rarely lasts more than a couple years, anyway. Since learning this technique, I'm never going back to nonstick pans again. We're not professionals or experts on this topic, so we always recommend getting advice from the pros before attempting yourself.
