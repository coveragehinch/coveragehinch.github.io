{% raw %}Hi there! It's been a while since the last time I've uploaded a video. I'm doing fine, I'm just super busy at school–perks of being a junior in College. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the video.  <br />I just got my 1st dose of Moderna vaccine, thankfully I didn't experienced any side effects aside from the swelling of the part where I got jabbed. (人 •͈ᴗ•͈)<br /><br />Please consider getting vaccinated, I'm afraid at first also because I am not that healthy as I seem. I suffered from a disease last 2018-2019, but I'm fine now. Prevention is better than cure.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />I do not own any of the music used in the video, all credits to Oak Studio.<br /><br />#treasure #teume #deco #journal #journaling #trending #doyoung #kpop{% endraw %}
