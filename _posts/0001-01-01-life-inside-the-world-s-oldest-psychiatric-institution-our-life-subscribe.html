At Lambeth Hospital in south London, the Trust has pioneered the use of short-stay emergency wards for patients in crisis. It's effectively run like A and E but for those with mental illness. Cameras are granted access for the first time to a world where critical decisions about risk are taken every day by psychiatrists and nurses. It works like a sorting office. Over the course of a few days clinicians assess patients and decide whether they are stable enough to return home or whether they need to go on to a longer stay psychiatric ward. Most patients are considered a danger to themselves or others and have either been sectioned under the powers of the Mental Health Act or have come in voluntarily. <br /><br />This film was first broadcast: 31 Oct 2013<br /><br />Watch More Documentaries<br />Our Life - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3A8xRMJ">https://bit.ly/3A8xRMJ</a> <br />Our History - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3rUpdhL">https://bit.ly/3rUpdhL</a> <br />Our World - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ftuckM">https://bit.ly/3ftuckM</a> <br />Our Stories - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ynfFyk">https://bit.ly/3ynfFyk</a><br /><br />Our Life brings you fascinating stories of social interest from around the world.
