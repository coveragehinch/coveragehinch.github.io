They have created a Southern Raised trademark sound where classical meets bluegrass and city streets meets country roads. SR has morphed a progressive sound that spans Christian Country/ Bluegrass, Celtic and Classical. They’re talented, they’re energetic, they’re Southern Raised. <br /><br />shop for our CDs and Merchandise <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://southernraisedbluegrass.com">http://southernraisedbluegrass.com</a><br /><br />FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA<br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SouthernRais...">https://www.facebook.com/SouthernRais...</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/southernrai...">https://www.instagram.com/southernrai...</a>  <br /><br />FOR BOOKING<br />srb@southernraisedbluegrass.com<br />southernraisedbluegrass.com<br /><br />Video Directed by: Matt Reith<br /><br />CREDITS <br />lead - Matt Reith<br />harmony - Emily Reith<br />harmony - Lindsay Reith<br />violin - Emily Reith<br />mandolin - Emily Reith<br />guitar - Matt Reith<br />banjo - Alex Clayton<br />bass - Lindsay Reith<br />audio - Michael Palmquist<br />audio - Joe Carrell{% endraw %}
