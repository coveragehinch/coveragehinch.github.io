{% raw %}At Michelin-starred NYC restaurant The Musket Room, chef Mary Attea draws on her own Lebanese heritage, as well as the ideas of other chefs in her kitchen, to make an inspired winter menu. Here we see her test out a mackerel with citrus vinaigrette, prawn-stuffed tortellini topped with lobster roe, and a play on barbecued pork in Middle Eastern spices. <br /><br />Credits: <br />Producer/Director: Daniel Geneen <br />Camera: Connor Reid, Michael Latchman <br />Editor: Michael Imhoff<br /><br />Executive Producer: Stephen Pelletteri<br />Development Producer: McGraw Wolfman<br />Supervising Producer: Stefania Orrù<br />Director of Audience: Terri Ciccone <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more episodes of 'Mise En Place,' click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://trib.al/cygRFDj">https://trib.al/cygRFDj</a><br /><br />Eater is the go-to resource for food and restaurant obsessives with hundreds of episodes and new series, featuring exclusive access to dining around the world, rich culture, immersive experiences, and authoritative experts.
