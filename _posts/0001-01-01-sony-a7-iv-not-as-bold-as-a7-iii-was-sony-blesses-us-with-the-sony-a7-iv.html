{% raw %}Sony blesses us with the Sony A7 IV.  They were more cautious than they were with the A7 III.  The new basic is now pretty basic again, and expensive.  Solid camera, just not quite as innovative.  A7 III destroyed the A7S II.  They were careful to keep the A7S III better than the A7 IV.  Here's my review of the specs and new features that better be coming on the A7S III!  4k 60p has a big crop.  No new slow mo just 120fps in 1080p.  But some interesting new features like animal eye detect autofocus in video, and focus breathing correction sound exciting!<br /><br />How will it perform vs Canon R6 and other hybrid full frame mirrorless cameras?  It has worse specs than the Fuji XT4 lol. <br /><br />If you buy today's gear instead of the Sony A7 IV through my affiliate links, you'll realize it has better specs, and cost 90 million dollars less with excellent Panasonic level autofocus.<br /><br />Fuji XT4 (big sale!) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vvP0ia">https://amzn.to/3vvP0ia</a><br />Fuji 16mm f1.4 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3G7KgnX">https://amzn.to/3G7KgnX</a> or cheaper refurbished <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3B2ZJC7">https://amzn.to/3B2ZJC7</a><br /><br />All my gear and recommended products can be found in my affiliate shop, thanks for shopping around! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/vegetablepolice">https://www.amazon.com/shop/vegetablepolice</a><br /><br />Patreon for Monthly Q&amp;A Videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/vegetablepolice">https://www.patreon.com/vegetablepolice</a><br />T-shirts and merch! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vegetablepolice.threadless.com/">https://vegetablepolice.threadless.com/</a><br />My Monkey Strength ebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://payhip.com/b/VyEG">https://payhip.com/b/VyEG</a><br />My Music from videos!
