{% raw %}Hey guys it's Jentzen Ramirez. Today's video is one of the most difficult videos I've ever filmed. No, this isn't click bait. Sadly Elliana and I have broken up, and in this video we explain why, and what or current feelings are. Elliana has been a HUGE part of my life, and I'm so grateful to have such a beautiful powerful person by my side for the last year. Elliana has taught me so many lessons, and most importantly she taught me how to love someone with all my heart. Just because our relationship is over doesn't mean our friend ship is. Jelliana will still live on, and Elliana thank you for being a beautiful soul in my life, and i'll have your back forever. Stay tuned to see us explain our feelings and what's going on.
