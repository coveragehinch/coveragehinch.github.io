{% raw %}I have already looked into the role of dime westerns, old west shows, and western movies in shaping the new narrative in the first part of the series; and in the second part I looked at the role of candy, dime museums, circuses, the early movie industry, and daredevils.  <br /><br />In this third-part, I look at about early radio and television in what now is going to be a four-part series focusing on how we came to the place where we are today related to the origins and development of a new culture and a new narrative about our history.<br /><br />Website/blog:  www.piercingtheveilofillusion.com<br />Patreon:  www.patreon.com/PiercingtheVeilofIllusion<br />UnGuru:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.unguruyourlife.com/educational-broadcasters/">https://www.unguruyourlife.com/educational-broadcasters/</a>{% endraw %}
