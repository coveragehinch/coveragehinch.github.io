{% raw %}What do you get when you have a Malaysian married to an American? Maggi Pizza! Since Malaysians are passionate about their Maggi, and Americans are obsessed with pizza, we thought we would combine them and see what happens. Watch as the Kumaar Family work together to create their own recipe to make a Maggi Pizza. Will it be terrible? Will it be delicious? Will it redefine food as we know it? Watch this video to find out!<br /><br />Malay (Bahasa Melayu) and English subtitles available.
