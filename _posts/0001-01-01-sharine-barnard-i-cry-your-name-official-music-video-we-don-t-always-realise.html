{% raw %}We don’t always realise that the feeling of love and the idea of being loved could make a person feel so vulnerable. This is a story of the inability of being able to love someone or be loved back. Even when worlds are apart, the emotions still linger and the heart will always remember. And that is still enough. <br />21-12-2020<br /><br />Someone’s love story. A song for you.{% endraw %}
