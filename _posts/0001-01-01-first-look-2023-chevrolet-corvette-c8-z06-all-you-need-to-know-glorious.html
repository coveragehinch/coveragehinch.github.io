{% raw %}This is the new Corvette Z06, and we’ll get the big news out of the way first: it’s being made in right-hand drive. It marks the first time we might be able to buy the most athletic ‘Vette officially in the UK. But with 670bhp,  it’s also the world's most powerful nat-asp V8 you can get. And in Z07 spec it has carbon wheels and a ginormous wing. Oh, and it also makes a fabulous noise. So allow Top Gear’s Ollie Marriage to geek out about it so you know the score before it hits our shores<br /><br />Subscribe to Top Gear for more videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear">http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear</a><br /><br />MORE ABOUT TOP GEAR:<br />Want to watch a bit of Top Gear on the internet?
