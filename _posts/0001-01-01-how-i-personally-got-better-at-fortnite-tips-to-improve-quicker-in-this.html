{% raw %}In this video, I talk about what I personally did to get better and improve at Fortnite. Many of you guys have noticed how better I have gotten at fighting, as well as how much my mechanics have improved recently, so I thought I should make an in-depth video showing everything I did to improve my building, editing, and aiming in such a short period of time. This practice routine is not as much of a training program as it is an overview or improvement guide that just shows what I actually did to get better. These include different creative maps like Finest 2v2 realistics, different ways I practiced including against my friends that were better than me, looking back at my own mistakes, and of course, some late game arena. So, let me know if this video helps you impr<br /><br />Finest 2v2 Realistics: 6570-5231-1418<br /><br />As always, if you enjoyed the video feel free to leave a like on the video and subscribe to the channel to stay up-to-date with my content.
