Although my life may not mean much to You,<br />it’s only You I wish to dedicate it to.<br />Though men may be unworthy to love You,<br />and though their love and hearts are ultimately worthless,<br />You can see their good intent.<br />And though men’s flesh doesn’t meet Your acceptance,<br />I wish for You to accept my heart.<br />Because I’m much, much less than dust,<br />there’s nothing I can do<br />but dedicate this loyal heart to You, oh God, to You.<br /><br />Oh God! Although my life may not mean much to You,<br />it’s You who I will dedicate my whole heart to.<br />Though I’m unable to do anything for You,<br />I will devote myself to You to loyally satisfy You.<br />I know that You must look upon my heart.<br />I ask for nothing in my life, but for my heart’s desire,<br />my thoughts of loving You to be accepted.<br />Because I’m much, much less than dust,<br />there’s nothing I can do<br />but dedicate this loyal heart to You, oh God, to You.<br /><br />Oh God! Although my life may not mean much to You,<br />it’s only You I wish to dedicate it to.<br />I was with You for long yet didn’t know You.<br />This is my biggest debt that I have never loved You.<br />I even said something behind Your back—<br />words, oh dear God, I should never have spoken.<br />Things like these make me feel forever in Your debt.<br />Because I’m much, much less than dust,<br />there’s nothing I can do<br />but dedicate this loyal heart to You, oh God, to You.<br /><br />from Follow the Lamb and Sing New Songs<br /><br />Please note: All videos on this channel are available to view free of charge.
