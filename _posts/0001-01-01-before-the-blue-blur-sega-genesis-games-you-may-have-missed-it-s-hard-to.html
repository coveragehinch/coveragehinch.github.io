{% raw %}It's hard to imagine in hindsight, but the Genesis was on the US market for nearly 2 years before Sonic showed up. Even longer in some other regions. In this one, we look at some games you may have missed around that time. <br /><br />I'm now on Patreon!

Captured via the Mega SG.<br /><br />2. The Genesis had numerous games in the RPG/Simulation/Strategy genre that people rarely talk about. There are the Warrior of Rome games mentioned here, plus stuff like Shadowrun, Buck Rogers, Traysia, Kings Bounty, Rings of Power, Battlemaster and many others. <br /><br />3. Sonic came out in Japan a bit later with some improvements over the US version. These differences are mainly in the backgrounds and the water effects in some stages. <br /><br />4. There were a number of 2 megabit games on the Genesis, but I consider Rambo III the better of that group. <br /><br />5. Early Genesis/Mega Drive games(88,89,90) tended to often have simple visuals and sound. To compare the early games on the platform to the later stuff is like seeing a generational shift all its own. I don't feel there is any other 2D platform out there that improved its library as much as the Genesis did in regards to graphics. <br /><br />6. My best friend who owned Air Diver was Tyrik, who also lent me games like Ninja Gaiden, Contra, Jackal, Shadow Dancer and R-Type for the various platforms he owned. Friends like him kept my broke ass in games for years, and if you're listening, brother, I've never forgotten it.{% endraw %}
