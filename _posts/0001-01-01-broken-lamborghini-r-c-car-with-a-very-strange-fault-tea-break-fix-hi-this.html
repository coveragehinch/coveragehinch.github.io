{% raw %}Hi, this little car has a very unusual fault. When you power it on it only works for 3 seconds. Every single time it will only last for 3 seconds!!! What could be causing this.<br />It was sent in by Stuart from infinitebargains4u over on eBay. This was faulty from new. Let's take it apart and try and fix it.<br /><br />My Mate Vince merch which goes towards supporting the channel<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.puddlt.com/my-mate-vince">https://www.puddlt.com/my-mate-vince</a> Check out the latest Christmas mugs.<br /><br />I have a PO box here in the UK, so if you would like to send something in that MAY be featured in a repair video, then here is the address. No items will be returned, so only send it in if it is of no value to yourself.<br /><br />PO Box 2597<br />Watford<br />WD18 1HT<br />UK<br /><br />I don't think couriers send to PO boxes, so in the UK it would need to sent via Royal Mail.<br /><br />Remember that this is just for entertainment and I am not an expert in these repairs. The processes in the video may not be the best way, the correct way or the safest way to fix these things. I do love fault finding and trying to fix broken things, so I hope that comes across in this 'Trying to FIX' series. Many thanks, Vince.{% endraw %}
