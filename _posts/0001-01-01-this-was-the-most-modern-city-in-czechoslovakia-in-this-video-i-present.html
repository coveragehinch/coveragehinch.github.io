{% raw %}In this video I present to you the history of a man called Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a who was a successful entrepreneur during the Czechoslovakian times. I Take you all with me on a journey to Zlin which was the most modern city in Czech Republic, to discover how a mans vision would change the world by his own shoe business which expanded in 20 countries across the world which then would provide more work opportunity‚Äôs in this city and education also housing for the workers that worked in the Ba≈•a factories. While I was out touring this town I buy some home produced chicken eggs and Vietnamese food. I will show a uncompleted railway project Ba≈•a started and I show the old tower Ba≈•a style buildings which are still standing. Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a was a Czech entrepreneur and founder of the Bata Shoes company. It became one of the world's biggest multinational retailers, manufacturers, and distributors of footwear and accessories.{% endraw %}
