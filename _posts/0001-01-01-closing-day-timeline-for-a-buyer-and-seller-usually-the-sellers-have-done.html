{% raw %}Usually, the sellers have done all of their hard work before the closing day with their packing and being moved out. Any and all repairs need to be completed before closing and the home needs to be left in Good or BETTER condition. <br /><br />On the day of closing, you need to do your final walkthrough and confirm what conveys and what does not. <br /><br />You need your Valid Photo ID at the closing and all signers need to attend. NC is a One to Buy, Two to sell state - so your spouse needs to be present to SIGN at closing. <br /><br />After you leave the closing office, you need to wait until you've been notified that the Deed was officially recorded. Congrats, now you have sold your home!<br /><br />Schedule A Closing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thomasandwebber.com/schedule-a-closing-with-thomas-and-webber/">https://thomasandwebber.com/schedule-a-closing-with-thomas-and-webber/</a><br /><br />Listen to our podcast on:<br />Apple Podcasts:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-home-lkn/id1457267215">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-home-lkn/id1457267215</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/51PNBq8USZ8Cfa8PlhifTJ">https://open.spotify.com/show/51PNBq8USZ8Cfa8PlhifTJ</a><br /><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/LawAtTheLake">https://instagram.com/LawAtTheLake</a><br /><br /><br />Thomas &amp; Webber<br />514 Williamson Rd. <br />STE. #431<br />Mooresville, NC 28117<br /><br />704.663.1600<br /><br />Real Estate Attorney Mooresville, NC<br />Closing Attorney Mooresville, NC<br />Ben Thomas - Real Estate Lawyer 31 years<br />Tiffany Webber- Real Estate Lawyer 5 years<br />Helping clients handle both residential and commercial real estate closings in Mooresville, NC.{% endraw %}
