Squats: This full-body compound move will tone your muscles, burn fat, and build lower body strength. It can also improve your balance and coordination, boost your overall endurance, and make you stronger. Squats create an anabolic environment that promotes muscle growth. If thereâ€™s one exercise you should do everyday for 4 weeks, itâ€™s the squat.<br /><br />2. Plank: The plank hits nearly every muscle in your body, especially your abs. This simple exercise will strengthen your core muscles and lower your risk for lower back pain. If you do planks regularly, youâ€™ll develop a strong back and abs. This exercise has multiple variations, such as the side plank, knee plank, rocking plank, single-arm plank, reverse plank, and Bosu walking plank.<br /><br />3. Push Ups: Most people hate push-ups. However, nothing beats this exercise when it comes to increasing body strength. This complex compound move works on your delts, pecs, and triceps. It also strengthens your legs and core muscles, improves sports performance, and makes daily activities easier.<br /><br />4. Jumping Rope: Jumping Rope is a great exercise which engages a lot of muscles, particularly your leg muscles. It burns more calories per minute than any other exercise. According to research, jump rope for a minimum of five minutes a day can improve physical fitness. Ten minutes of nonstop jumping can provide the same benefits as 30 minutes of jogging.<br /><br />For more information, please watch the video until the very end.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Medical Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i">https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i</a>{% endraw %}
