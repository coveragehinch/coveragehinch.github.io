Over the years I have gain a lot of experience dealing with teams and managers all around the world, so I think I’m pretty knowledge when it come to know the qualities of a leader. <br /><br />There are some core values that leaders have that must be instilled from the start of their leadership journey. <br /><br />So, let’s discuss more about what are the core values of a leader below:<br />One of the most important leadership traits every leader must have is commitment. You need this in order to maintain a solid work ethic, as things might get tough at times but you need to keep going. In previous videos we spoke about resilience and that stand even more true for commitment.<br /><br />Next, I want to talk about empathy as it can go a long way and is one of the core values of leaders. You need to be able to treat your team or staff with respect and understanding if you wish for them to look up to you. Without empathy you could be faced with a lot of troubles ion the work place and it create a few disgruntled employees.<br /><br />Honestly is one of the essential qualities of a leader and it can be the make or break of your business or team dealings. This needs to come from your heart and if you are not an honest person only bad things will happen to you. When dealing with team members it’s best to not sugar coat the truth if you or them are in a bad situation.<br /><br />The qualities of a leader don’t end there though because you also need transparency and patience. These important leadership core values are crucial to finding leadership success as they show your dedication to the team or business. <br /><br />Transparency with staff members and management can help you grow and flourish your leadership role as well as your company. Another core value of a leader is having patience as it can help you see through projects you deal with unscrupulous individuals.<br /><br />If you apply just these few qualities of a leader you will already see a big improvement in the way your team looks up to you. There are a few more qualities of a leader I would like to briefly discuss with you below so keep reading to learn more.<br /><br />It is important to have integrity when dealing with people in your team as well as clients or future prospects. That helps you build a rapport for yourself and your company, and makes people respect you more.<br /><br />Remember it's imperative that all communication is clear and concise, so that you team are aware of what needs to be done. Without clear and concise instruction staff could fail to complete task or at worst do them incorrectly. The simple act of talking proper can help to boost your confidence as well as the confidence of your employees.<br /><br />Another thing to include in the qualities of a leader is having influence. What do I mean by this? Well, it pairs with communication, and it all boils down to be likeable and authentic. If people see you lack confidence or vision why would they want to work for you? <br /><br />Remember people feed off each other’s energy, so it’s critical to be aware of body language when feeling down on a bad day. <br /><br />Lastly you need to be focused on what your company goals are and make everyone aware that they are working towards the same thing. Don’t be afraid to award staff for performing well. It can be taking them out to a lovely dinner or adding a little bonus to their pay check at the end of the month.
