{% raw %}We are tokenizing history &amp; cultural NFT using 3D scans on the Morpheus Project marketplace.<br /><br />Our project has official NFTs from museums and top organizations like the UN.<br /><br />1. All the NFT on the platform will be holographic type and will need the red-blue glasses to view. Though we're working to develop the tech so hopefully, we won't need the glasses anymore in the future.<br /><br />2. Anyone with the 3D model can join our platform and upload the model on our software to generate holographic content.<br />More on this link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.community.morpheus.art/post/making-your-first-holo-nft-art">https://www.community.morpheus.art/post/making-your-first-holo-nft-art</a><br /><br />3. Yes, we do have agreements with museums and other organisations. <br />We have the Holo-MUSEUM platform: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.holo-museum.com/">https://www.holo-museum.com/</a> for museums' artefact collection online exhibition. Besides preserving history, the Morpheus Project is a financial tool for museums and galleries to support their digitisation projects. <br /><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.morpheus.art/">https://www.morpheus.art/</a><br />SDK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.holo-museum.com/">https://www.holo-museum.com/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MorpheusHoloNFT">https://twitter.com/MorpheusHoloNFT</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/YwSbYUgEj5">https://discord.gg/YwSbYUgEj5</a><br /><br />❤️ Your kind support means everything!
