{% raw %}The Marvel Cinematic Universe is known for its cohesiveness. A plot line that began in the original &quot;Iron Man&quot; can develop through a dozen Marvel movies, and reach a satisfying conclusion without missing a beat. We've watched characters like Captain America become a hero, fight a ton of supervillains, and eventually get a happy ending.<br /><br />But because Marvel's movies spin off in so many directions, with so many characters, not every plot line gets a real conclusion, and some are still waiting for their resolution. Here are a few MCU storylines that completely disappeared without explanation.<br /><br />#MCU #Marvel #MarvelCinematicUniverse<br /><br />The Leader | 0:00<br />Darcy's romance | 1:18<br />Pepper and Tony's break | 2:13<br />Erik Selvig's problems | 3:13<br />Justin Hammer's revenge | 3:56<br />Betty and Bruce's relationship | 5:02<br />Nick Fury going rogue | 6:07<br />The planet Xandar | 7:09<br />The fate of Bobbi Morse | 8:14<br />What happened to Ghost? | 9:21<br />The Scorpion's revenge | 10:20<br /><br />Read Full Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.looper.com/473304/mcu-storylines-that-disappeared-without-a-trace/">https://www.looper.com/473304/mcu-storylines-that-disappeared-without-a-trace/</a>{% endraw %}
