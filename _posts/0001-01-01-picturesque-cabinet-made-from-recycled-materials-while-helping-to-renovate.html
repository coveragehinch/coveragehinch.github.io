{% raw %}While helping to renovate my parents' house, I kept some old ash boards, such as old window sills, thresholds, and some railings. I tried to rework all this material and create something interesting. I always wanted to use hexagons in my design, and wooden bark, so I took a chance and experimented.<br />As a result of my efforts, this cabinet is made entirely of recycled ash boards.<br />In this project I tried to show that even old materials are suitable for creating new, in my opinion, expensive things.<br />This time I also tried not to use any nails, screws or pins.<br />Maybe this cabinet will find a place in my son's or daughter's room, and I hope it will bring them only positive emotions.<br />It was a lengthy project, but the cost of effort and time is rewarded by the result. Do not be afraid to experiment and allow your fantasies to rein!  Take care of yourself and stay safe.<br />Thank you all for watching!{% endraw %}
