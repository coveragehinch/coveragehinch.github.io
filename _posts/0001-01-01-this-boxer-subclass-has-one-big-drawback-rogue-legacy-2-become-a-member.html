In this game, your legacy defines you. Spend your parents’ inheritance and grow the family manor to give your children a better fighting change. Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities. Your daughter could be an archer. She could also be a Vegan. Also play how you want to. Go hard and fast, or take it slow and steady, and build your character up until you’re ready for greater challenges.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />End card Music: Peacock by 7 Minutes Dead<br />#RogueLegacy2<br />#Letsplay<br />#Boxer{% endraw %}
