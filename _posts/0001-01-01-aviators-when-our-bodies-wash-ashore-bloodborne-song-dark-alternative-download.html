This time, as a spiritual successor to &quot;No One Will Save You,&quot; I've told another sad tale of unfortunate encounters with a higher power. Long ago, an unnamed fisherman hears voices beneath the waves and wanders from his decrepit village out into the Deep, to find ascension in death and to have audience with the mother of the ocean. &quot;When Our Bodies Wash Ashore&quot; is a Lovecraftian tale of madness and unholy infatuation with the deep wonders below.<br /><br />It's also very nearly a 10 minute song, so I may have gone a little mad myself.<br /><br />Artwork by the wonderful SeanSoong:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.deviantart.com/seansoong/">https://www.deviantart.com/seansoong/</a><br /><br />For more music or to get in touch, find me on<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Aviators">https://www.patreon.com/Aviators</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Aviators84">https://twitter.com/Aviators84</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/aviatorslivestream">https://www.twitch.tv/aviatorslivestream</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/JWqXshB">https://discord.gg/JWqXshB</a><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Are you waking up afraid<br />Are you brave enough to glance behind the curtain<br />To use the eyes inside<br />Have you felt them in your sleep<br />Have you seen them in a vision that's uncertain<br />A dream outside your mind<br /><br />Once come upon in and ancient land<br />I've heard the tales of an unseen hand<br />Myths of the otherside that took my breath away<br />Out in the deep I've seen something real<br />The mouth of the void that the waves conceal<br />Speaking low, as my thoughts draw near the fray<br /><br />When the currents carry on<br />Lifeless waves we float along<br />There's a solemn depth below<br />Deeper truth I cannot know<br />Our own hastened time has come<br />In this death our minds are young<br />When our bodies wash ashore<br />Sorrow's children nevermore<br /><br />Are you scared to look behind<br />Do you feel the breath of sunken apparitions<br />Awake, impure, divine<br />Now I'm sure they're coming soon<br />In the blackness my unholy friend has spoken<br />Through a shiver in my spine<br /><br />My own senses wash away<br />I've let go of my eyes<br />Grant me life beyond the veil<br />For this humble sacrifice<br />You're the next to float along<br />As we all grow insane<br />Let the dream pull you below<br />No more watchers will remain<br /><br />So bring me close to you<br />I want to be consumed<br />I'm transcending yet alive<br />Grant me vision deep inside<br />Transformed and unafraid<br />This earthly vessel fades{% endraw %}
