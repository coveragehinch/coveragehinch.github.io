{% raw %}A flagship synth from 2011, the John Bowen Solaris is both vintage and modern at the same time. It's all digital, but it can mimic both old analogs as well as the 80s hybrid synthesizers and more.<br />High quality&amp;24 Hours Build Time: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pcbway.com/">https://www.pcbway.com/</a> <br /><br />Support this channel on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/espenkraft">https://www.patreon.com/espenkraft</a><br /><br />Check out the synth here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.johnbowen.com">https://www.johnbowen.com</a><br /><br />The idea to use a Compact Flash card to store patches, presets, Wav-files and even the OS is a great concept in my opinion. Yes, it means you can loose everything if not careful, but as long as you have a backup of the card you can put it into another Solaris and boot it up to reveal YOUR Solaris.<br />Using the CF card does not mean the Solaris boots the OS from the card, you flash the Solaris from the card when there's a new OS update you want to install into the synth.<br />You do need to have the CF card present to have your presets and patches available though.<br /><br />The demo song was made to showcase what I feel is the best part of the Solaris, the ability to mimic the classic hybrid synths like the Prophet VS, the PPG, and also synths like the Yamaha FS1R which uses formant shaping. The drum loop that comes up at the end is also out of the Solaris as you can create patches based off your own Wav-files.<br />The first part of the demo song is all recorded by hand, with a free flowing tempo. I also play an arpeggiated part on top of this.<br />The second part is recorded to tempo.<br />Some of the patches are part of this Solaris' preset bank, while some of the sounds are either edited presets or my own makings.<br />External FX used in the demo track: Valhalla VintageVerb, GFI Specular Tempus.<br />The demo track has been mixed and mastered using my well documented workflow and gear.<br /><br />Find my music here:<br />iTunes Apple music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/35ZTdfR">https://apple.co/35ZTdfR</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/38aoWMB">https://spoti.fi/38aoWMB</a><br />Bandcamp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://espenkraft.bandcamp.com/">https://espenkraft.bandcamp.com/</a><br />Google Play: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2NrgXD9">https://bit.ly/2NrgXD9</a><br /><br />Find my patches and sample packs through these links:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thepatchbay.co.uk/product/tal-sampler-the-digital-collection-vol-1-by-espen-kraft/">https://thepatchbay.co.uk/product/tal-sampler-the-digital-collection-vol-1-by-espen-kraft/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sound7.co.uk/products/italo-disco-synth-pop">https://sound7.co.uk/products/italo-disco-synth-pop</a><br /><br /><br />Please join me on social media:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/espenkraftmusic">https://www.facebook.com/espenkraftmusic</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/espenkraft/">https://www.instagram.com/espenkraft/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EspenKraft">https://twitter.com/EspenKraft</a><br /><br />I use DistroKid for all my releases onto streaming services. <br />Try out Distrokid yourself and get a 7% discount off your first year by using this link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://distrokid.com/vip/espenkraft">http://distrokid.com/vip/espenkraft</a><br /><br />Growing up I listened to so much synth-pop and it's only natural that my own music takes inspiration from many of the acts I loved back then. I still love them and listen to them!<br /><br />Howard Jones, Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, New Order, Erasure, Thompson Twins, Tears for Fears, The Human League, Propaganda. FGTH, Ultravox, OMD, Eurythmics, Duran Duran, Giorgio Moroder, Jean Michel Jarre, Jan Hammer, Alphaville, A-ha  as well as loads of artists doing what is now called Italo Disco. And many more great acts like Nik Kershaw, Spandau Ballet, Wham, Dire Straits ++{% endraw %}
