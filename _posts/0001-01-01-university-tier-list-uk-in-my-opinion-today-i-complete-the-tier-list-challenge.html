Now, I don't know about you, but it all seems a bit mad to me so I thought I should put it all out there on the internet (I bet you can relate to it!).<br /><br />ABOUT ME:<br />I'm Dylan (21), an Economics and Finance Graduate from the University of York (with a year studying abroad in Australia at USYD). After discovering Investment banking and Economics wasn't my desired career while studying at university, I decided to audition to do a MA (Masters) in Professional Acting at top drama schools across the UK, eventually landing a spot at ALRA - Where I am training for the next 15months... Despite the career change Economics and University life was the most valuable experience I've ever had. My 2 biggest hobbies Travelling and Investing in the Stock Market arose out of it along with many other great things.
