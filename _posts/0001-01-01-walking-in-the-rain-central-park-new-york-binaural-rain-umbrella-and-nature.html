{% raw %}Evening walk in the rain in Central Park, New York. This was filmed around 7:30PM and features a walk around Central Park on a rainy summer evening. Central park is the most visited urban park in the United States and also the most filmed location in the world. Sounds of people, birds, and thunder can be heard throughout the video as well. Toward the end, I got a little lost and had to make my way back toward the south entrance.
