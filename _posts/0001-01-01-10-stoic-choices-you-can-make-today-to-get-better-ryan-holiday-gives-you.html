{% raw %}Ryan Holiday gives you 10 Stoic inspired choices that you can make today to live a better life. <br /><br />The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t. What we have influence over and what we do not. The same is true for us today. If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.<br /><br />00:00 Intro<br />01:07 Say yes to what matters<br />01:40 Be disciplined<br />02:36 Don't suffer in advance<br />03:09 Stop wasting time<br />03:43 Control your emotions<br />05:25 Focus on how far you have left to go<br />06:20 Stand up for others<br />07:19 Focus on what's in your control<br />08:06 Be willing to look stupid<br />09:03 Seek challenges<br /><br />FREE GUIDE to Stoic philosophy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dailystoic.com/freeguide">https://dailystoic.com/freeguide</a><br /><br />Strengthen the community: <br />1.
