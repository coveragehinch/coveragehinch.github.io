TURK BACK IN STOCK!<br /><br />Will Smith's brand new YouTube show 'Best Shape Of My Life' has recently gone live, and in episode 4... he gives up. Yup! One of the most famous faces on the planet decides he doesn't want to go to the gym or eat well anymore, especially after a weekly check-in where he's put on weight. THIS IS IMPORTANT!<br /><br />While I'm sure there's an element of intent with this to add to the series, what matters is this is multimillionaire and super celebrity Will Smith acting how we all do, proving that no matter what your circumstances, at times trying to stay and get in shape feels almost impossible.<br /><br />That shouldn't deter you – far from it – but hopefully seeing someone like this go through the worst can inspire you to get back on track as and when you need a kick up the butt!<br /><br />#WillSmith #WillSmithBestShapeOfMyLife #SimonMiller<br /><br />Cameo! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cameo.com/simonmiller316?utm_campaign=profile_share">https://www.cameo.com/simonmiller316?utm_campaign=profile_share</a><br />Patreon! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/SimonMiller316">http://www.patreon.com/SimonMiller316</a><br />Power13 Cookbook today!
