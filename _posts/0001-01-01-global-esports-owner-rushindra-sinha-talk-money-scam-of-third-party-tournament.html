{% raw %}​@Global Esports  founder-owner @Rushindra Sinha  tweeted out regarding his frustration with certain tournament organizers. He mentioned how the behavior of certain organizers is absolutely unacceptable and stated,<br />In response to the replies to his tweet, Dr. Sinha repeatedly mentioned how certain tournament organizers don’t pay teams their winnings and instead resort to avoiding the teams and shifting the blame onto the sponsors.<br />He later added further context to the story by sharing his respect for @Skyesports , @The Esports Club , and @NODWIN Gaming , who have been working hard to help the growth of the esports industry in India. Furthermore, he warns upcoming teams to be very selective about participating in tournaments.<br />In response to a Facebook post regarding the matter, Dr. Rushindra Sinha mentioned that it is regarding an organization they have been working with for more than a year and that it was not Loco, @UPTHRUST ESPORTS , Penta, or @Villager Esports .<br />It is unfortunate how, due to the dishonesty of certain tournament organizers and brands, the entire esports scene in the country is adversely affected. From the small regional to large-scale international level, many brands and organizations are taking an interest in the growth of Valorant and esports. However, such situations create distrust between teams and tournament organizers, which ultimately holds back the Indian esports scene from further growth.<br /><br /><br />My second channel - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA</a><br /><br />Sponsored By - <br />Extra0rdinnary is sponsored by GemWire - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/">https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/</a><br /><br />BECOME CHANNEL MEMBERS - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLFsRmpJtYMvEjoxgl0fEw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLFsRmpJtYMvEjoxgl0fEw/join</a><br /><br />Contact And Follow me on -   <br /><br />Follow me on Instagram  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/extra_0rdinnary/">https://www.instagram.com/extra_0rdinnary/</a><br />Follow me on Facebook  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Extraordinary997">https://www.facebook.com/Extraordinary997</a><br />Follow me on Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EoOfficial99">https://twitter.com/EoOfficial99</a><br />My DISCORD - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/X8fFZYg">https://discord.gg/X8fFZYg</a><br />You Can Send Me News on Instagram. <br /><br />About My channel -<br /><br />Extra0rdinnary is an esports and gaming news platform that puts a focus on pro players, teams, creators, and the games that make it all possible. <br /><br />DISCLAIMER -<br />If you need a song removed on my channel, please message me on Instagram . <br />© Copyright: We / I do not own any of the material in this video.<br />I upload videos for promotional and preview purposes only!<br />If you are the Producer or Photographer and would like the Video taken down please Email me and we / I shall remove it immediately.<br />Please do not issue a &quot;Copyright Strike&quot; against the Channel as it affects all previous work.
