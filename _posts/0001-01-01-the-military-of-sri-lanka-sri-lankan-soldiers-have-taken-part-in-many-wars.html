In the course of the civil war, the military has been transformed from a ceremonial force to a modern army. Since 2004, Sri Lankan troops have been a part of the UN peacekeeping force in Haiti, which is the country's first major overseas mission.<br /><br />The military of Sri Lanka is organized into three branches: Army, Navy, and Air Force.
