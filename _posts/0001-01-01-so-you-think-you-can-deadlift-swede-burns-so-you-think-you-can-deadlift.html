{% raw %}So you think you can deadlift?  Tim thought he could, then we posted an absolutely disgusting video of him pulling 315lbs on Instagram.  It was so bad, in fact, that we had to get one of our top team members and inventor of the 5th Set Method Swede Burns to come to our S5 Compound and fix Tim's deadlift.<br /><br />Watch how Swede implements just a few slight queues to the deadlift to make it look great!<br /><br />Add these to your deadlift and let us know how it works!<br /><br />Buy Swede Burns' 5TH SET FOR POWERLIFTING: METHODOLOGY FOR TRAINING AND COMPETITION (EBOOK): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.elitefts.com/5thset-for-powerlifting-methodology-for-training-and-competition.html">https://www.elitefts.com/5thset-for-powerlifting-methodology-for-training-and-competition.html</a><br /><br />#deadlift #fixmydeadlift #eliteftsmobile{% endraw %}
