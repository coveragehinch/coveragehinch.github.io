Despite what the conventional medical model has taught us about cognitive decline and Alzheimerâ€™s, these disorders are actually within our power to stop, slow, and reverse. <br /><br />In this video, Dr. Dale Bredesen shares inspiring stories from patients who have reversed cognitive decline and are now thriving. He also discusses the contributing factors that lead to cognitive decline and much more. <br /><br />Dr. Bredesen is internationally recognized as an expert in the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, and the author of the New York Times bestsellers The End of Alzheimer's, The End of Alzheimer's Program, and his latest book The First Survivors of Alzheimer's: How Patients Recovered Life and Hope in Their Own Words.<br /><br />He has held faculty positions at UC San Francisco, UCLA, and the University of California San Diego. He has directed the Program on Aging at the Burnham Institute before coming to the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in 1998 as its founding president and CEO.
