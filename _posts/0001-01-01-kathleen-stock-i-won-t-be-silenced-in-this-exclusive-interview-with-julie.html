{% raw %}In this exclusive interview with Julie Bindel, Dr Stock says:<br />➡️ She's not giving up<br />➡️ Gender theory is a pseudo-philosophy<br />➡️ Trans people should be legally protected<br />➡️ She had to stay at home for her own protection<br /><br />Kathleen Stock was forced to resign from Sussex University professor after an aggressive campaign of targeted harassment over her gender critical views.<br /><br />The campaign to push Prof Stock out of Sussex began when she self-published a number blog posts critical of extreme transgender ideology. She was concerned that the majority of academics, including philosophers such as herself, were reluctant to criticise campaigns to introduce self-identification for transgender people.<br /><br />Although Kathleen is understandably upset by the conduct of the small number of abusive students, she is adamant that many of them are taking a cue from the influential adults around them. “I don’t think they’ve actually read what I think. There’s a lot of enabling, or inciting, of individuals in this story,” she says.<br /><br />// Timecodes //<br /><br />00:00 - 00:55 - Introduction<br />00:55 - 02:31 - Kathleen Stock tells her story<br />02:31 - 03:39 - The anti-Stock Sussex protests<br />03:39 - 07:24 - Where did Katheen’s trans ideology journey begin?<br />07:24 - 13:34 - Julie Bindel and Kathleen Stock name names<br />13:34 - 17:47 - Is trans ideology rooted in misogyny?<br />17:47 - 20:10 - Julie Bindel: This debate is being stifled<br />20:10 - 23:52 - How does this affect young lesbians?<br />23:52 - 24:58 - Katheen Stock’s book, Material Girls<br />24:58 - 26:39 - Stonewall has taken over our national institutions<br />26:39 - 33:48 - Kathleen’s battle with her Sussex University union<br />33:48 - 37:52 - Maria Miller MP began the self-identification process<br />37:52 - 40:45 - Julie Bindel on prostitution and the end result of self-ID<br />40:45 - 47:19 - The human cost of trans protests<br />47:19 - 49:13 - What’s the future for women’s rights, Stonewall, LGBTQI+, in the UK?<br />49:13 - 49:30 - Julie's conclusion<br /><br />#KathleenStock #Trans #AcademicFreedom{% endraw %}
