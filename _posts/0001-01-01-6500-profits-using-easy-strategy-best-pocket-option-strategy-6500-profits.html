{% raw %}$6500 profits using easy strategy | best pocket option strategy<br />Hello, my name is Katie and you are on the channel Katie tutorials. Todayâ€™s video has a special strategy as this method consists of three simple indicators and can have a big impact on market actions. It is very easy to use and at the same time very effective. In the strategy I use two Moving Average with different periods and Parabolic sar also with different periods. I set the candles for 30 seconds and trade at 1 minute intervals.<br /><br />Platform Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3hnDHCM">https://bit.ly/3hnDHCM</a><br />For bonus 50% use promo code: 50START<br /><br />My Official Telegram Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/katietutorialsofficial">https://t.me/katietutorialsofficial</a><br /><br />Friends, remember that your trading account is only yours, and do not write me about being your account manager.
