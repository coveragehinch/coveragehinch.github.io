{% raw %}Comet Leonard is the comet of the year. It will be visible to naked eyes in December 2021. Comet A1 Leonard was discovered on 3rd January 2021 and at that time, it was about 5 astronomical units away. But now, the comet has come closer to the Earth and will be easily visible to naked eyes in December from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. <br /><br />It will reach an apparent magnitude of +4 and hence can be seen through unaided eyes and even binoculars or a small telescope. Comet Leonard might reach an apparent magnitude of +1, which means it might become way brighter than predicted. The best day to see comet Leonard with naked eyes is 6 December with it will be just 5 degrees away from Bootes' brightest star, Arcturus. This video explains in detail how to see comet Leonard with naked eyes.<br /><br />Space apps: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/space_apps_2021">https://bit.ly/space_apps_2021</a><br /><br />Basics of Astrophysics series: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3xII54M">https://bit.ly/3xII54M</a>{% endraw %}
