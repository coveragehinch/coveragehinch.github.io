{% raw %}Even though he is only 16 yéars óld, he is already feared by gangsters<br /><br />Yue Feng is a young thug with exceptional streetfighting abilities. He will stop at nothing to defeat all challengers - until, in an tragic accident, he kills a fellow competitor and is sent to prison. Eight years later, Yue Feng emerges a changed man. He no longer fights, and is looking for a new life of peace and fulfillment. But it's brutal on the streets, and redemption doesn't come easy. His brotherhood is destroyed, family members murdered, and a loved one humiliated - a deadly chain reaction that leaves him no choice but to unleash his power in the name of justice. The King of the Streets, China's first street-fighting movie, pits real-life martial artist Yue Song against more than 10 of the world's top contenders in MMA, Jiu-jitsu, Jeet Kune Do, Sanda, and Muay Thai boxing.<br /><br />Movie: The King of the Streets<br />Year of Release: 2012<br />Production companies: <br />Watch the full movie here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/King-Streets-Kang-En/dp/B07FYLV719">https://www.amazon.com/King-Streets-Kang-En/dp/B07FYLV719</a><br /><br />Thank you for watching. <br /><br />sci fi movies, romance movie review, sci fi review, sci fi summary, storyflix, movie review, movie summary, movies under 10 minutes, science fiction movie, movie trailer, full movie, daniel, trailer, daniel cc, daniel cc movie review, Netflix, story recapped, movie recapped, story, recapped, story recapped channel, movie recap, story recap, movie recaps, horror movie review, true scary stories, horror stories, mr. nightmare, creepypasta, creepy stories, true horror stories, horror, scary, stories told, movie review, Daniel, daniel CC, science fiction, trailer, Daniel CC movie review, daniel cc movie channel, movie explain channel, movie recap and explain, daniel movie, movie review, movie trailer, story recapped, story recapped movie review, story recapped channel, movie explained, movie recap, story recap, movie recaps, ending explained, storyflix, movie storyline, suspense movies, netflix movies, daniel cc, movie review channel, daniel cc movie, daniel cc review, story recapped glass, recap king{% endraw %}
