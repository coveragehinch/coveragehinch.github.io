{% raw %}My eBook and Training Program: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com/product/superfunctional/">https://www.thebioneer.com/product/superfunctional/</a><br /><br />My physical book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com/product/functional-training-and-beyond/">https://www.thebioneer.com/product/functional-training-and-beyond/</a><br /><br />The term functional training comes with a lot of baggage. The term is often maligned for being meaningless, or being a &quot;buzz word.&quot; While there are many interpretations, however, one simple way to think about this question is: does your training aid you in your every day activities?<br /><br />Of course, for an athlete, functional training might mean something entirely different. For everyone else, however, it should improve the ability to move well and without pain. Functional training should make everything easier, and it should prepare you for unexpected situations.<br /><br />Doesn't any training do that? Not necessarily. If you purely focus on strength training, or cardio, you might be lacking in endurance or power, respectively. Many &quot;strong&quot; individuals struggle to climb stairs without getting out of breath. Mobility issues, likewise, are rife. Many ostensibly &quot;fit&quot; people still cannot get into a deep, resting squat, or touch their toes.<br /><br />These issues impact our ability to perform daily tasks, and they open us up to potential injuries and accidents. And we haven't even considered the role of cognitive fitness!<br /><br />This video is not in any comprehensive, but the aim is to help you determine if your training is functional - at least by this definition. This is a starting point to help you potentially find weak areas, or issues that you could address. To me, this is what it really means to be &quot;fit.&quot;<br /><br />I certainly have areas here that I need to focus on! (After making this video, I tweeked my back, again!)<br /><br />And anything beyond that, is SuperFunctional  :-P<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />The website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com​​">https://www.thebioneer.com​​</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thebioneer​​">https://www.facebook.com/thebioneer​​</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thebioneer​​">https://www.patreon.com/thebioneer​​</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thebioneer​​">https://www.instagram.com/thebioneer​​</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/thebioneer">https://www.twitter.com/thebioneer</a>{% endraw %}
