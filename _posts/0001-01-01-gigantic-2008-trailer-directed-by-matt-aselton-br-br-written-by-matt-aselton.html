The afterthought child to elderly parents, and the youngest son in a trio of successful brothers, a shady oil man and a surgeon, Brian is searching for his place in the world. Unfulfilled by his work he spends a good portion of his day pursuing his goal of someday adopting a baby from China. He gets swept up in a romance with the lovely but misguided Harriet Lolly when she comes in to his store one day and falls asleep on one of the beds. To win her over, he must compete with her bear of a father, Al Lolly, an art-collecting loudmouth with a bad back and deep pockets...<br /><br /><br /><br />Visit The Movie Planet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://themovieplanet.wordpress.com/">http://themovieplanet.wordpress.com/</a><br /><br />Official site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thegiganticmovie.com/">http://www.thegiganticmovie.com/</a><br /><br />IMDB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1176251/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1176251/</a>{% endraw %}
