{% raw %}Welcome to Lympia, Skarinou, and Ayios Theodoros villages. Together, we will discover street art, incredible food, adorable donkeys, and breathtaking nature and hiking spots<br />When I first took on my travel show Tia Does Agrotourism, I thought I knew Cyprus. But noooo. not really. Although local, how many of you truly know your country off by heart? <br />My birthplace, the insanely beautiful island of Cyprus, held so many hidden treasures deep within it, and the minute I started touring it, I realized that all these years...well I hadn't even scratched the surface! <br />Stick with me, while I peel off yet another layer of Cyprus, and hand it to you on a beautiful Greek plate. <br /><br />COPY MY TRIP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/LympiaandSkarinouTia">https://bit.ly/LympiaandSkarinouTia</a><br />FOLLOW ON INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tia_does_travel/">https://www.instagram.com/tia_does_travel/</a>{% endraw %}
