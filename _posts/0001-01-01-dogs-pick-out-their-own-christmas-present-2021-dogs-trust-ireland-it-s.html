{% raw %}It’s finally #SantaPawsDay - the day all our dogs get to pick their own Christmas present! We couldn’t squeeze them all in, but we hope you smile as much watching this as we did recording it. <br /><br />To all our supporters and everyone who sent a Santa Paws present for the dogs, thank you so much, we hope you have a very Merry Christmas, from all the dogs and the humans at Dogs Trust!{% endraw %}
