{% raw %}Human beings' addiction to greed and pleasure is putting the planet itself at a risk. A seeker asks Paramahamsa Prajnananandaji how are we to live then, so as to not self-destruct? Paramahamsaji agrees that our greed indeed is creating a big problem for us. He shares his perspective and also stories from the life of other spiritual leaders, and then provides us with guidance on how to change our own lifestyles.{% endraw %}
