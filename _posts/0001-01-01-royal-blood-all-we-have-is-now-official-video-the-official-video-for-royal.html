They quickly made their presence known, with pounding drums and heavily distorted bass guitar defining characteristics of their ferocious blues-rock sound. The band gained many plaudits early in their career, touring with the likes of Arctic Monkeys, Iggy Pop and Foo Fighters, before going on to win Best British Group at the Brits in 2015 receiving their trophy from their musical hero and admirer Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page.<br /><br />Their catalogue boasts the Mercury Prize nominated self-titled debut album released in 2014 that spawned hits such as &quot;Out of the Black, &quot;Little Monster:, &quot;Come On Over&quot; and &quot;Figure it Out&quot;, as well as their second successive UK number one album &quot;How Did We Get So Dark?&quot; released in 2017 which featured &quot;Lights Out&quot; and &quot;I Only Lie When I Love You&quot;.<br /><br />#RoyalBlood #AllWeHaveIsNow #Typhoons{% endraw %}
