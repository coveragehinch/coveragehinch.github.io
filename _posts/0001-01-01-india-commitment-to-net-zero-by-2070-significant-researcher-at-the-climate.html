{% raw %}Researcher at the Climate Council Dr Simon Bradshaw says India committing to a target of net zero by 2070 is &quot;significant&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;The fact that they have made that net zero commitment for the first time and so are calling time on fossil fuels effectively - that is significant,&quot; he told Sky News Australia. <br /><br />&quot;But certainly we'll have to see further increase in that commitment as we're going to have to see from all countries.&quot;<br /><br />He said there is comparatively an argument for Australia moving faster <br />as net zero by 2050 is &quot;in our economic interests&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;So we shouldn't be comparing Australia and India - different countries, different responsibilities but also, fundamentally, Glasgow's about accelerating action through the 2020's, and that's what we're going to be judged on.&quot;{% endraw %}
