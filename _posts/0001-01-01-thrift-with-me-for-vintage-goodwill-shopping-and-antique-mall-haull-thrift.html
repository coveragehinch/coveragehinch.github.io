{% raw %}Thrift Shopping at Goodwill is a great place to search for vintage and home decor. Thrift with me today in Spanaway Washington at a local GW and antique mall where I find a gorgeous vintage velvet dress that looks like something Free People would have for much more! I also score some beautiful turquoise and Mexican sterling jewelry. I love to look for vintage jewelry while I shop to find unique pieces for my website The Vintage Bombshell.<br /><br />Shop my online store The Vintage Bombshell Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thevintagebombshell.com/">https://www.thevintagebombshell.com/</a><br /><br />The wireless microphone system I use: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.saramonicusa.com/products/blink500b4">https://www.saramonicusa.com/products/blink500b4</a><br /><br />#goodwillhaul #thriftwithme #shopgoodwill{% endraw %}
