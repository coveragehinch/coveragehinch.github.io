{% raw %}When we read the local headlines and stick to our own quarantine routines, it might be easy to forget that this virus is affecting the entire world. And as scary as that is, it also means we can collaborate with other countries to gain the best possible understanding of how to treat COVID-19. Since the spring, I’ve been reaching out to different doctors across the world to learn about their various COVID protocols. One of the most valuable contacts I’ve had, Dr. Paolo Tordiglione, has been seeing amazing results with ozone therapy and he is my guest on this episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy. <br /><br />Dr. Tordiglione is a Senior Consultant in Neuroanesthesia in the Neuro-ICU at Policlinico Umberto I University of Rome Sapienza, Italy. He is a specialist in pain medicine and an expert in ozone therapy. He is the former President of Doctors of the World Italy, founder of Physicians for Human Rights Italy, Vice President of the Academy of BioRegenerative Medicine, and a member of the Molecular Medicine Academy. He is currently developing a company called PLEYO, with the goal of scientifically improving the quality of human life, and has been researching ozone therapy since 2000.<br /><br />This episode is brought to you by Simple Mills, Paleovalley, and Apeel.<br /><br />Right now, Simple Mills is offering Doctor’s Farmacy listeners 20% off.
