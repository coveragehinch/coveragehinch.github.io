{% raw %}Boris Kodjoe teams up with Depend® for the launch of its Stand Strong for Men's Health™ initiative, which aims to celebrate men taking charge of their health and destigmatize incontinence. Watching a close friend and mentor battle prostate cancer inspired Boris to start honest conversations around issues like incontinence, a leading side effect of the disease. For every purchase of select products this September and November, Depend will donate a portion of proceeds to the Prostate Cancer Foundation, up to $350,000.<br /><br />To learn more about the Stand Strong for Men’s Health initiative, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depend.com/en-us/stand-strong">https://www.depend.com/en-us/stand-strong</a><br /><br />To learn more about the work of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.prostatecancerfoundation.org">https://www.prostatecancerfoundation.org</a>{% endraw %}
