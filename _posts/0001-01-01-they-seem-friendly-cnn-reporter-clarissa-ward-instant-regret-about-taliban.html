{% raw %}Based.<br /><br />CNN reporter, Clarissa Ward, interviews Taliban, calls the takeover “friendly,” and Joe Biden blames everybody but himself for the collapse of Afghanistan.<br />&quot;[The Taliban are] just chanting 'death to America' but they seem friendly at the same time. It's utterly bizarre,&quot; said Ward in a segment with New Day. <br /><br />Ward said those out on the street are &quot;mainly&quot; Taliban, and that there are notably &quot;far fewer women&quot; roaming about than normal. In fact, Ward said she herself was asked to step back. &quot;They've just told me to stand to the side because I'm a woman.&quot;<br /><br />Original video:<br />CCN &quot;mostly peaceful Taliban&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-zP5zvDu9s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-zP5zvDu9s</a><br />================================<br />CNN: Violent but mostly peaceful Taliban transfer of Power!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7tXGBaZYCs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7tXGBaZYCs</a><br /><br />#memes{% endraw %}
