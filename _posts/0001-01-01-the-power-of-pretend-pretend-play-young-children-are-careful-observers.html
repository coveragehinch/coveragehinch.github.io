{% raw %}Pretend Play: Young children are careful observers of the role models around them and they use pretend play to explore, make sense of and rehearse real life as they know it. In doing so, they create stories. Here, absorbed in being a mother with a baby, one girl leads the action. With baby on her back, she uses available props to help her to step into a grownup world. The book becomes the cellphone - and they record the moment. This kind of symbolic play, where children pretend something 'stands for' something else, underlies literacy learning, where print 'stands for' what the writer means to communicate.<br />Acknowledgement: With thanks to Simunye.{% endraw %}
