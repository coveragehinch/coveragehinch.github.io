{% raw %}The formula for attracting blessings in life is actually quite easy, the problem is most people just don't do it. What is this secret formula I speak of? Well, we will get to that in a minute, but FIRST. Let's see if this hypothetical story sounds familiar to you...<br /><br />Pretend you've been wanting something out of life for a long time now (maybe it's a promotion... a baby... or some other goal) and then, months later, after lots of patience, trial and tribulation, you finally get it! #YAY<br /><br />You should be so happy, right? And maybe you are for a moment or two, but most likely you're already thinking things like this...<br /><br />&quot;Well, it's about time!&quot; or &quot;I'm so relieved that finally happened. Onto the next thing.&quot;<br /><br />Basically, you just take it for granted and then move on with your life.<br /><br />Well, I hate to break it to you, but this is a surefire way to destroy your blessing attraction abilities. Every time you do this, you are lessening your ability to attract more goodies into your life.<br /><br />Subscribe ''Attract Blessings'' to get newest interesting pet video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7QzzvJyWthVwINQhRJ0Qng">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7QzzvJyWthVwINQhRJ0Qng</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Only In God Will You Find True Happiness üíù <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEQIaen3LOCmBQGZbyDjDlapsP91hTdE5">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEQIaen3LOCmBQGZbyDjDlapsP91hTdE5</a> üíù<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />#edlapizpreaching2021 #edlapiz #edlapizpreaching2021latest<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Purpose: We made this collection to share preaching videos for Christians every day.
