{% raw %}UPDATE: This product seems to be half price at most places.

At up to Â£649 ($649) we take a look and see if this is worth paying double the price of an iPad for the reMarkable 2. We also take a look at the essential accessories you should get with your reMarkable, the Marker Plus, and the folio case.<br /><br />0:00 - Intro<br />0:08 - Unboxing<br />0:26 - Battery life<br />0:48 - A look at the pen and eraser<br />2:30 - A look at the case<br />3:28 - Complaints<br />4:03 - E-reader functionality<br />4:33 - Palm rejection<br />4:51 - Core writing experience<br />5:24 - Convert to text<br />6:07 - Syncing with laptop<br />6:27 - Is this a must-buy?<br />8:16 - Is this for you?<br />8:36 - Potential threats<br />9:14 - Try it with its great return policy{% endraw %}
