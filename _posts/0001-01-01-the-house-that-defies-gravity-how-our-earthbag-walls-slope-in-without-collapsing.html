{% raw %}The House That Defies Gravity!? How Our Earthbag Walls Slope In Without Collapsing<br />We go a bit into the physics behind the earthbag corbelled dome. Why our walls won't collapse without any interior support. We also make progress on getting more cob on the outside of the dome.<br /><br />Shirts, merchandise, and digital products (with original designs by us!) <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://green-dream-tees.creator-spring.com/">https://green-dream-tees.creator-spring.com/</a><br /><br />…………………………..Subscribe to our channel…………………………….<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y7oe684o">https://tinyurl.com/y7oe684o</a> <br /><br />…………………………….See more of us online………………………………..<br />Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://greendreamproject.org/">http://greendreamproject.org/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/greendreamproject1">https://www.facebook.com/greendreamproject1</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/greendreamproject/">https://www.instagram.com/greendreamproject/</a><br />TikTok:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@greendreamproject">https://www.tiktok.com/@greendreamproject</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gdproject1">https://twitter.com/gdproject1</a><br /><br />…………………………………..Contact us…………………………………………...<br />Mail: <br />Green Dream Project <br />PO Box 203 <br />McNeal, AZ 85617 <br /><br />Message: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://greendreamproject.org/contact">https://greendreamproject.org/contact</a><br /><br />……………………………………..Questions…………………………………………<br />• Join us Thursdays on YouTube to chat with us and ask your questions live!<br />• Take a look at frequently asked questions about us and what we do:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://greendreamproject.org/faqs">https://greendreamproject.org/faqs</a><br /><br />………………………………..Ways to help………………………………………<br />Helps our daily off-the-grid expenses, video making, and future projects<br />• Remember to like and share videos, and subscribe if you haven’t<br />• Become a Green Dream Project channel member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_7n21RGpsAo9i2N7hN_uAA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_7n21RGpsAo9i2N7hN_uAA/join</a><br />• Jessica and her mom have a shop with hand-made art and jewelry:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gdp.storenvy.com">https://gdp.storenvy.com</a><br />• Shirts, merchandise, and digital products (with original designs by us!) <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/green-dream-tees">https://teespring.com/stores/green-dream-tees</a><br />• Our Amazon wish list:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3LFZW14HPY5VQ?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3LFZW14HPY5VQ?ref_=wl_share</a><br />• Paypal:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/GreenDreamProject">https://paypal.me/GreenDreamProject</a><br /><br />……………………………Help Support our Non-profit……………………<br />Helps with business expenses and future programs that support our mission of educating and helping others to live sustainably<br />• Make a donation (click the donate button on our home page):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://greendreamproject.org/">https://greendreamproject.org/</a><br />• Set your Amazon Smile account to support Green Dream Project:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smile.amazon.com/ch/47-4852319">https://smile.amazon.com/ch/47-4852319</a><br /><br />We are Jim and Jessica, a husband and wife team who made the leap from city life to an off-grid homestead in Southern Arizona. We've started this lifestyle equipped only with two Permaculture Design Certificates and a whole lot of determination.  <br /><br />We’d like to share our journey of starting a sustainable homestead from scratch with all its ups, downs, and lessons learned.  Watch us take on the challenge of modern homesteading, off-grid life, and turning this barren piece of land into a desert oasis.<br /><br />#greendreamproject #earthbagbuilding #offgrid{% endraw %}
