{% raw %}The second Catch B-side, A Chain Of Flowers is also included here. &quot;Towards the end at Miraval, &quot; recalls Smith, &quot;I was getting a bit stuck for lyrics, trying to finish 23 songs in a month, so I said to the others, 'please give me some words' Simon slipped some under my door, and they included the line 'all I want is summer.' That was the catalyst for me to write A Chain Of Flowers. it's essentialy a song about the awful fear of losing someone you love.&quot;{% endraw %}
