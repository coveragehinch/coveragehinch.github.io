{% raw %}Can you survive the movie Old by M. Night Shyamalan?<br /><br />Animator: Kim <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Kangmin_kim1">https://twitter.com/Kangmin_kim1</a><br />Editor: Elias<br /><br />With an interesting plot device, Daniel and Elias ventures to the unknown that is Old. This movie explores the concept of fast aging and the repercussions that come with it. I watched this without Elias and thought the idea was fun enough to make a video out of it. Hope you guys enjoy it.<br /><br />DanPlan  ♪ ~ ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ<br />-----------<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/danplan0/">https://www.instagram.com/danplan0/</a><br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/dpMerch">http://bit.ly/dpMerch</a><br />Business email: djgreenapples@gmail.com{% endraw %}
