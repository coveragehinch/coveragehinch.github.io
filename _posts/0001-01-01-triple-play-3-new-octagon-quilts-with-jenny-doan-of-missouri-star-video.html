Once a month, Jenny, Misty, and Natalie each demonstrate their own, unique take on a favorite block, technique, or template. In this episode, the talented Doan ladies show off three fabulous patterns for our brand new octagon templates!<br /><br />Misty's Octagon Blooms quilt is made with the small octagon template, Heat n Bond Lite, and 10 inch squares of precut fabric (layer cake). Her fabric is Sonnet Dusk 10&quot; Stackers by Corri Sheff for Riley Blake. <br /><br /><br />Jenny's Good Vibrations quilt is made with the medium octagon template, yardage, 1.5 inch strips (honey bun), and a layer cake. Her fabric is Between Friends 10&quot; Squares by Shannon Christensen for Windham Fabrics. These pretty blocks are layered like a pineapple quilt, and <br />they're a delight to make! <br /><br />Natalie's Quilt-As-You-Go Octagon Nine Patch quilt is made with the large octagon template, fusible interfacing,  and a layer cake. Her fabric is Happy Chance 10&quot; Squares by Laura Heine for Windham Fabrics. This quilt was inspired by an antique Rocky Road to Kansas quilt, but Natalie's version is so much simpler! <br /><br />Get the supplies needed to make these projects by clicking the link below:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.missouriquiltco.com/pages/octagon-triple-play-quilt-tutorial?utm_campaign=qt_t424&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_content=msqc&amp;utm_term=qt_t424">https://www.missouriquiltco.com/pages/octagon-triple-play-quilt-tutorial?utm_campaign=qt_t424&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_content=msqc&amp;utm_term=qt_t424</a><br /><br />@Missouri Star Quilt Company provides free quick and easy sewing, quilting, and craft tutorials because we love to create.
