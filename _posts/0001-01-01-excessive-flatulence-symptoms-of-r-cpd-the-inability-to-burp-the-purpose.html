{% raw %}The purpose of this video is to introduce those with excessive flatulence (gassiness) to a potential explanation they may not have encountered before: retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction (R-CPD).  Persons with R-CPD typically say that in addition to flatulence, they can’t burp, experience socially-awkward gurgling noises, and experience abdominal bloating. Treatment of R-CPD can dramatically reduce flatulence in this group of persons. <br /> <br />Other sources below the video window as easily found as possible: <br />YouTube “Can’t Burp”  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ryeCv0_qi8&amp;t=5s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ryeCv0_qi8&amp;t=5s</a><br /><br />Original description medical journal article found by searching “bastian belch”:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2473974X19834553">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2473974X19834553</a><br /><br />Resources listed on one page:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://laryngopedia.com/r-cpd-resources/">https://laryngopedia.com/r-cpd-resources/</a><br /><br />If you would like to have an educational / informational call with Dr. Robert Bastian please contact us at laryngopedia@bastianvoice.com.<br />––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br />Educational Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://laryngopedia.com/">https://laryngopedia.com/</a><br /><br />Clinic Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bastianvoice.com/">https://www.bastianvoice.com/</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/bastianvoicedoc/">https://twitter.com/bastianvoicedoc/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bastianvoiceinstitute/">https://www.instagram.com/bastianvoiceinstitute/</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BastianVoice/">https://www.facebook.com/BastianVoice/</a><br /><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bastian-voice-institute/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/bastian-voice-institute/</a>{% endraw %}
