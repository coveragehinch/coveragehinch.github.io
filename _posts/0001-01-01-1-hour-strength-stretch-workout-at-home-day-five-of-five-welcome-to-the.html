{% raw %}Welcome to the last day, day 5 of this 5 day 1 hour at Home Workout Series! <br /><br />Last in the series is an hour stretching workout combined with strength movements. This at home workout will target your entire body, with bodyweight strength and stretching exercises that all contribute towards increased flexibility.<br /><br />This full body stretch focuses on the hamstrings, hips, core, back and shoulders. <br /><br />Find that quiet place, position your mat and enjoy a relaxing stretch combined with some gentle holds and dynamic moves.<br /><br />I have not listed the movements as this was not set and I simply performed the routine as I felt throughout. <br /><br />I hope you enjoy this and maybe think about incorporating more stretching into your weekly routine. <br /><br />Cx<br /><br />#carolinegirvan<br /><br />➞ 5 x 1 Hour Workout Series Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1QCKrfgPXwu9GdPKYGVaprI1ZTMdq2">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1QCKrfgPXwu9GdPKYGVaprI1ZTMdq2</a><br /><br />➞ You can Subscribe to my YouTube Fitness Channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/carolinegirvan/?sub_confirmation=1">https://youtube.com/c/carolinegirvan/?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />➞ I've recently joined Instagram too, follow me here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/carolinegirvan">https://www.instagram.com/carolinegirvan</a><br /><br />➞ Business Contact: info@carolinegirvan.com<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br /><br />If you are new to exercise or planning on embarking on a new fitness programme, you should consult your physician. <br />This video may offer health, fitness or nutritional information and is meant for educational purposes only.
