{% raw %}Do narcissists get better as they get older? Narcissist don’t get better with age <br /><br />Welcome my channel! If this is your first time seeing my face or hearing my voice, my name is Lee and I am a self aware #narcissist. I have narcissistic personality disorder  ( #NPD ) and I've been in therapy for my personality disorder since 2017 and it has definitely changed my life because without it, I would have lost everything. <br /><br />The point of these videos is to help bring awareness from the other side of the narcissistic *buse spectrum. All my videos give perspective on why many narcissists do what they do and the possible different reasons behind them. The victims and survivors get validation and the #Narcissists (those that are willing) get to see that you can get help and that you are not alone. <br /><br />1 on 1's and all my links - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://beacons.page/mentalhealness">https://beacons.page/mentalhealness</a> <br /><br />You can find me on -<br /><br />Tiktok MentalHealness - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mentalhealness?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@mentalhealness?lang=en</a><br /><br />Insta- Mentalhealnesss - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mentalhealnesss/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/mentalhealnesss/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MentalHealness85">https://www.facebook.com/MentalHealness85</a><br /><br />Personalized Vid Responses- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wisio.com/mentalhealness">https://www.wisio.com/mentalhealness</a><br /><br />Click the BEACON up top for direct links.
