{% raw %}Puppy Picks Out His Own Kitten At The Shelter To Take Home<br /><br />Little Raven, a Tamaskan husky pup, needed a friend to grow up with but her human mom Christina knew that you canâ€™t just pick a best friend for someone. Instead, she took Raven to a shelter in Lubbock, Texas to do it herself!<br /><br />Penny and Her Pets - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/raven_and_woodhouse">https://www.instagram.com/raven_and_woodhouse</a><br /><br />====================================================================<br />Copyright issues and other stuff, please contact us by email at shtrixone@gmail.com.
