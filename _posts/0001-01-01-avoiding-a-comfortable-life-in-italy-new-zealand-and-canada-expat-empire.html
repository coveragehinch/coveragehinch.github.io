Much to the surprise of his friends and family, Daniel left his stable job in Italy when he was 27 years old to search for adventure. He got a Working Holiday visa and hopped on a plane to New Zealand before he could even speak English! After attending a language school and acquiring a few IT certificates, he found a job in Christchurch and lived there for 4 years. <br /><br />Once he felt his life was becoming too comfortable in New Zealand, Daniel set off on a brand new adventure in Canada. He soon discovered that moving to Canada was much harder than moving to New Zealand, but he persevered and built a great life for himself over the last few years in Vancouver, even recently receiving his permanent residence.<br /><br />Daniel has followed his passion for adventure to many different countries and never let himself become too comfortable and complacent.
