{% raw %}Stokley leads this R&amp;B ballad with his smooth vocals and his sleek runs and riffs! He takes it to church towards the end enjoy!!!!!  The second song is just a reprise of the first song. These two tracks are off of Mint Condition's album &quot;Definition Of A Band&quot; If anyone has any requests from this CD please inbox me or comment.{% endraw %}
