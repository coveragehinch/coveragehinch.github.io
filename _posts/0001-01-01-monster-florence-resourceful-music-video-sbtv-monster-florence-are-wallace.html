{% raw %}Monster Florence are Wallace Rice, Alex Osiris, Dream Mclean, Tom Donovan, Cameron Morrell, Johnny Poole. <br /><br />SBTV are happy to present the visuals for their new track 'Resourceful.'<br /><br />Luke Davies (Director): &quot;The Monster Florence guys are all very open and trusting when it comes to their films. If they weren’t, this music video would have never been made. The closest thing I could boil it down to was this, and heads up it still doesn’t make much sense… I wanted to take those Grime Daily &amp; SBTV videos, the sort of high paced, direct performance to camera films. And try to mix it with something with the scale and theatrics of Michael Jackson’s iconic “Thriller” music video. I thought that provided a lot of interesting juxtaposition to play with, and instead of trying to mix the two styles nice and neatly, I decided to let them clash. I think it makes for quite a jarring video that reflects the track and can hopefully really hold an audience’s attention for a few minutes.&quot;<br />----<br />Make sure to subscribe &amp; never miss a video! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/NeverMissSBTV">http://bit.ly/NeverMissSBTV</a><br /><br />SBTV is one of the leading online youth broadcasters &amp; is the only place you need to be going to get the best coverage in and out of the music scene.
