{% raw %}One of RuPaul's Drag Race's most famous, controversial, and beloved seasons still wasn't without riggory, as we discussed in the Riggory of All Stars 2. Queens like Alaska and Katya were favored by the judges, while queens like Phi Phi O'Hara, Ginger Minj, and Tatianna were cast aside. <br /><br />So in today's video, we're going to take a look at every episode of Drag Race All Stars 2 and determine how the show would have went if there was no rigging, and everything was fair. Are the Top 4 different? Are the challenge winners different? We're going to break it all down!<br /><br />Let me know in the comments how you think I did with my (mostly) fair results and what decisions you would have changed!<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thedragdetective">https://www.instagram.com/thedragdetective</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DragDetective">https://twitter.com/DragDetective</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thedragdetective">https://www.patreon.com/thedragdetective</a>{% endraw %}
