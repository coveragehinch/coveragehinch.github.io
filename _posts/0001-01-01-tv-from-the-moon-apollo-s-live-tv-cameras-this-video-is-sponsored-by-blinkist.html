In fact it was touch and go as whether of not live TV would be used and it was down to Neil Armstrong as the commander of the lunar lander if it would be used. But to get live TV from the moon was a technical challenge in it's own right, so in this video we look at the TV cameras and the corporate battle to get the landing in to the front rooms of millions.<br /><br />This video is sponsored by Blinkist<br /><br />Written, Researched and Presented by Paul Shillito<br />Images and footage : NASA, RCA, CBS, Westinghouse, Semifluid.com, Kevin Gallegos, EEVblog2<br />   <br /><br />A big thank you also goes to all our Patreons :-)<br /><br />Eριχθόνιος JL<br />Abrakodabra Kobra / 25%<br />Ai<br />Alipasha Sadri<br />Alistair Brown<br />Andrew Gaess<br />Andrew SMITH<br />Brian Kelly<br />Cameron Elliot<br />Carl Soderstrom<br />Charles Thacker<br />ChasingSol <br />Collin Copfer<br />David Gorostiaga<br />Dom Riccobene<br />Dragoncorps<br />Etienne Dechamps<br />Florian Muller<br />George Bishop II<br />Henning Bitsch<br />Henri Saussure<br />inunotaisho <br />james t early<br />Jesse Postier<br />Jim Early<br />Johan Rombaut<br />john edwards<br />Jonathan Merage<br />Jonathan Travers<br />Joshua Rea - Dawn Aerospace<br />Ken Schwarz<br />L D<br />László Antal<br />Lawrence Brennan<br />Leifur Thor<br />Lorne Diebel<br />Paul Gorlinsky<br />Pyloric <br />SHAMIR <br />stefan hufenbach<br />Steve J - LakeCountySpacePort<br />Tawn Kramer<br />Tim Alberstein<br />Tomasz Leszczyński<br />Vincent<br />Will Lowe{% endraw %}
