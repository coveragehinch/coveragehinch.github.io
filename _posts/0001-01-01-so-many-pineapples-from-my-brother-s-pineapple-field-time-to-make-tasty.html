{% raw %}How time flies as suddenly it was the harvesting time of brothers pineapple field. Usually the pineapples will be harvested on the exact time when the fruits are getting yellowish since they are for selling. So by the time they were sent to the market each fruit have become perfectly ripe. Both my brother and Lahiru brother was very busy and worked hard by collecting the harvest from their pineapple field for past week. It’s very common in our village, Dankotuwa to grow pineapple in the coconut plantations. Even grandmother got the pineapple cultivation done when she was in charge of the lands. Now our brother has taken over that role. Infact I requested brother to not to cut off the pineapple crops on the edge of the land but to let them ripe fully. It’s a known fact that the pineapples get sweet and luscious when they get ripen naturally while in the pineapple bush itself with that sweet fragrance intoxicating the entire area. When this heavenly fragrance starts floating in the air, it sends an instant invitations to squirrels, porcupines, pigs and rats to feast on these luscious tropical fruits. These fruits get safe guarded mainly because of the thorns of the pineapple tree barks. Actually these thorns are a nuisance where our hands always gets confronted with them while picking up the pineapples. In our house, there is a special knife with about 2-3 feet in length to cut them off. This special knife is been made with a curve edge in the tip where the pineapple stems get cut off very easily without damaging the hands. <br /><br />Together with about 7-8 ripe pineapples, I brought home two partly raw ones too. I always make jam if there are extra pineapples at home. I always prefer to make my jams by caramelising the sugar so that it gives the jam a rich golden brown in color. I had some kiwi fruits at home which was brought by uncle Siriwardena. I decided to make another batch of jam by cutting the kiwi fruits and mixing them with a portion of already cooked pineapple jam to make another different type of jam. Kiwi and pineapple taste is indeed a match made in heaven.<br /><br />What ever said and done, it’s nothing like having a pineapple slices sprinkled with salt, pepper and a dash of chilli powder. Trust me that taste is indescribable. But when it comes to our brother, his only satisfaction is eating the pineapple core. Upto today I wonder what is so fancy that my brother finds in chewing the hard middle core of the fruit. There were times when Brother used to snatch the hard core of the pineapple and runs off. <br /><br />Brother brought an unusual drink to me while I was making the Jam. As usual it’s not a secret that his unusual imaginations and unusual cooking recipes truly taken us by surprise. When mixed with thick coconut milk, his drink gave a taste buds tingling mango deliciousness. Pineapple is a known tropical fruit which tend to increase the body heat but coconut milk reduce the heat and balances it perfectly. I must have tasted brother's drink so heavenly, may be because of my tiredness after finishing off the jams.<br /><br />Since it’s the rainy season with intermittent showers throughout the day, going out is impossible. So I decided to make a tea time sweets to go with the evening tea. After cutting pineapple in to pieces, I sautéed them in ghee and mixed them with a mixture of semolina and jumbo peanuts. Then put the rich moist mixture into a medium container where I scattered some raisins and sultanas into the bottom. Once the well pressed mixture turns upside down it sure did give a very appealing look and a taste as well. The rich fragrance and the texture of the ghee gave an authentic taste of Indian sweets. But more than that, I was very happy and pleased when I saw how Grandmother and Brother enjoyed the tea time sweets with such a satisfaction on their faces.<br /><br />Love you All!<br />Nadee<br /><br />© All rights reserved<br />So many Pineapples from my brother's pineapple field, time to make tasty Delicacies!
