{% raw %}In this video you will learn about relationships in Microsoft Access. You will learn how to relate data from different tables together, and why it's important for good database design.<br /><br />Simone from Bridgeport, Connecticut (a Platinum Member) asks: I'm a realtor. I'm in the process of setting up my first Access database. I've been using Excel for years to track my customers and the houses they've purchased. Once in a while I get a customer who has purchased multiple houses. Should I make a separate entry for each of them in my customer table? It seems like this would be an awful lot of duplicated data.<br /><br />Silver Members and up get access to an Extended Cut of this video. Members will learn about Self Joins, Global Relationships, and Referential Integrity which is where you can prevent entry of a child record without a matching parent record, or delete a parent if it has children. We'll also talk about cascade updates and deletes and why I personally don't use them.<br /><br />MEMBERS VIDEO: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/F4DLbs__LFQ">https://youtu.be/F4DLbs__LFQ</a><br /><br />BECOME A MEMBER:<br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCl7-jJie4ifOVK87FINIuDg/join">https://youtube.com/channel/UCl7-jJie4ifOVK87FINIuDg/join</a><br />or My Site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/THMember">https://599cd.com/THMember</a><br /><br />LEARN MORE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/Relationships">https://599cd.com/Relationships</a><br /><br />LINKS:<br />Subforms: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/Subform">https://599cd.com/Subform</a><br />Open Form Specific Data: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/OpenFormSpecific">https://599cd.com/OpenFormSpecific</a><br />Blank Template: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/Blank">https://599cd.com/Blank</a><br />Contacts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/Contacts">https://599cd.com/Contacts</a><br />Access Expert 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/ACX1">https://599cd.com/ACX1</a><br />Relationships Seminar: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/RelationshipSeminar">https://599cd.com/RelationshipSeminar</a><br /><br />COURSES:<br />FREE Access Beginner Level 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/Free1">https://599cd.com/Free1</a><br />$1 Access Level 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/1Dollar">https://599cd.com/1Dollar</a><br /><br />FREE TEMPLATE DOWNLOADS:<br />TechHelp Free Templates: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/THFree">https://599cd.com/THFree</a><br />Blank Template: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/Blank">https://599cd.com/Blank</a><br />Contact Management: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/Contacts">https://599cd.com/Contacts</a><br />Order Entry &amp; Invoicing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/Invoicing">https://599cd.com/Invoicing</a><br />More Access Templates: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/AccessTemplates">https://599cd.com/AccessTemplates</a><br /><br />ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:<br />Donate to my Tip Jar: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/TipJar">https://599cd.com/TipJar</a><br />Get on my Mailing List: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/YTML">https://599cd.com/YTML</a><br />Contact Me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/Contact">https://599cd.com/Contact</a><br />TechHelp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/TechHelp">https://599cd.com/TechHelp</a><br />Consulting Help: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://599cd.com/DevNet">https://599cd.com/DevNet</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/LearningAccess">https://twitter.com/LearningAccess</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Access">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Access</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://products.office.com/en-us/access">https://products.office.com/en-us/access</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/access/">https://microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/access/</a><br /><br />KEYWORDS:<br />microsoft access, ms access, #msaccess, #microsoftaccess, #help, #howto, #tutorial, #instruction, #learn, #lesson, #training, #database, lrelationships, relational, one-to-many, one-to-one, many-to-many, relate data, self join, global relationships, edit relationships, referential integrity, parent, child, matching, cascade updates, cascade deletes<br /><br />QUESTIONS:<br />Please feel free to post your questions or comments below.
