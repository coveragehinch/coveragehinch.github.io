{% raw %}RAID Shadow Legend's Best Uncommon Champions<br />Armiger, Saurus, and Shieldguard build &amp; masteries<br />Subscribe here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/36Z4kY6">http://bit.ly/36Z4kY6</a><br /><br />Today in RAID: Shadow Legends we'll review my top 3 uncommon champions. Really, the only three uncommons I'm comfortable recommending maxing out and building. Armiger, Shieldguard, and Saurus for campaign farming will be the spotlight of today's video. They're really great for beginner RAID players but can also scale into the end game.
