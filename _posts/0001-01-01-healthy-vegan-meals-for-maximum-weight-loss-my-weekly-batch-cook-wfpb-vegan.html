{% raw %}Hey Friends! I have some DELICIOUS meals for you today that are fantastic for maximum weight loss, following the starch solution! If you are on a plant based diet these are so tasty and perfect for whatever your goals are. I also am showing you what a weekly batch cook looks like for me, as you know, batch cooking has been the key to my success changing my life. <br /><br />If you're new here, welcome! I created this YouTube Channel to share my experience with losing 70 lbs in 2020 on a whole food plant based diet.<br /><br />I decided very soon after starting my channel to no longer include sponsorships any longer, and want all the products I recommend to be genuine things I love and use. However, making youtube videos is extremely labor and time intensive. If you have found my content at all helpful to your journey, please consider showing your support and making a small donation to help me continue making these videos.

Add in dried fruit if desired, I like a few raisins and dried mulberries (These are my fave: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3oqrgKk).">https://amzn.to/3oqrgKk).</a> Once warm, add in vanilla, cinnamon, plant milk, and any other fresh or frozen fruit I added pomegranates seeds for that holiday zest and a yummy crunch! <br /><br />Lunch: <br />Delicata squash (I like to cut, scoop out the seeds, and cut in slices and cook at 400 until fork tender- about 30 min) with some steamed broccoli. I topped the broccoli with some hickory balsamic vinegar from California Balsamic (discount code coming soon!) and dak's salt free everything bagel seasoning!

It was DELISH! <br /><br />Batch Cook Recipes: <br />Delicata Squash: <br />I like to cut in half, scoop out seeds, and slice and cook at 400 until fork tender. <br />Steam potatoes: I just steamed on the stove until fork tender<br />Japanese Sweet Potatoes: I like to wash, cut off the ends, and cook at 400 F until they are squishy- usually around 1-1.5 hours depending on size (longer if they are large). <br />Cheese sauce: You can find the original recipe in this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/o343ERrAbyY">https://youtu.be/o343ERrAbyY</a><br />I made some substitutions to this one, I added a bag of cauliflower, as well as some different seasonings than usual. It was super tasty! Don't be afraid to try some new combos of flavors if you are feeling adventurous, or just follow my original recipe for a guaranteed yummy sauce! <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE for new videos every Monday and Thursday.<br />Give this video a HUGE LIKE if you are just getting started (or looking to get started) on your health journey through plant based living.<br /><br />Please let me know if you have any questions below, I will do my best to answer each one!
