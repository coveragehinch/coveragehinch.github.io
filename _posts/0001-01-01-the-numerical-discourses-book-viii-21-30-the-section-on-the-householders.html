To this end, I do appreciate whatever financial gifts you may be able to make that will go towards my housing/shelter, food, medicine, and transportation needs. If you like to contribute by supporting my work in teaching and making these online translations and recordings of suttas freely available, you are welcome to offer your financial gifts via Paypal: www.paypal.me/candanabhikkhu<br /><br />Blessings of the Triple Gem.<br />Bhante C.<br /><br />About this project:<br />Over the past 30+ years, in my quest for understanding the Dhamma, i.e. the Teachings of Lord Buddha, I have dedicated countless hours studying the suttas found in the Pāli Canon of the Theravada Tradition (Words of the Elders) as I sat at the feet of many a great teacher, trying to learn and grasp the meaning behind the words. <br />In these difficult times, however, where time itself has become truly constricted in its abundance, the curious and struggling minds of individuals do not necessarily have the same luxuries of sitting down and reading the Nikāyas, let alone exploring their meaning, something that was enjoyed only a generation or two earlier. Instead, one becomes hesitant to even pick up one of the Nikāyas given their massive volume, therefore, the danger of their inaccessibility (by shying away from reading the Pāli Nikāyas) looms in the horizon; this, while considering that many newcomers to the Dhamma are often petrified to tackle the wonderful exploration that would otherwise be awaiting them in those voluminous pages. Thus, as one of my own students expressed of her apprehension despite her love for the Dhamma, to pick up one these precious texts, I saw it necessary for posterity to go ahead and transfer these words onto audio. I realize the amount of work, time and energy this would take, but the necessity for making the Dhamma available in an age of scarcity of time where most of our time is spent driving, sitting long hours in commute, etc., becomes all the more relevant, if not imperative.<br /><br />To this end, I am dedicating my time and energy to do my small part in retranslating and recording the precious words of Lord Buddha digitally for posterity; hoping that listeners would be able to taste them and realize their fruits (through daily practice), by listening to and understanding the wonderful gems within the words of Lord Buddha that have survived the test of time during the last 2600 years. <br /><br />Mettacittena,<br />Candana Bhikkhu<br />(Garbis J. Bartanian, Doctor of Buddhist Ministry, DBMin, LMFT).{% endraw %}
