{% raw %}What’s holding you back from finding love? In this session, behavioral scientist turned dating coach, and Hinge's Director of Relationship Science, Logan Ury, will teach you how to recognize (and overcome!) your dating blindspots. You’ll discover why the spark is a myth, what really matters — and what really doesn’t — in a long-term partner, and why you think you know what you want, but you’re wrong. Logan blends data-backed research with practical exercises to help you find, build, and keep the relationship of your dreams.<br /><br />About SXSW:<br />SXSW dedicates itself to helping creative people achieve their goals.
