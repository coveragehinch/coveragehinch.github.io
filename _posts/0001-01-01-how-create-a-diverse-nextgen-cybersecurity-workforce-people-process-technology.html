{% raw %}From supporting a permanent remote workforce and accelerating digital transformation to preparing for an expanded threat landscape – it is more critical than ever that Security Leaders have the right structure and support in place to face the challenges of a post-COVID world. CISO’s have been integral to organizations surviving the last 12 months where the need to be agile has never been as pressing. Though these added pressures have highlighted the continued shortage of cybersecurity personnel – how do we bridge this gap to create a diverse, NextGen, cybersecurity workforce? <br /><br />During this panel we will hear from senior security leaders as they discuss their experiences and lessons learned for the evolving role of the CISO and their department. <br /><br />About Speakers:<br />Jeffrey Moore: Chief Product Security Officer, Draeger<br />Anne Coulombe: Head of Data Protection, MassMutual<br />Wanda Jones-Heath: CISO, U.S. Air Force<br />Sujeet Bambawale: CISO, 7-Eleven <br /><br /><br />About GDS Summit:<br />Disruption is nothing new. What’s different today is the speed at which disruption is happening – particularly when it comes to technology which is addressed at our GDS Summits. 72% of Fortune 500 CEOs cite the “rapid pace of technological change” as their biggest business challenge going forward. Cloud, mobile, analytics: all are changing the game when it comes to how your business operates and transforming your IT infrastructure to take advantage of those new opportunities remains a critical concern. Discuss these topics and more at our GDS Summit.<br /><br />The question remains: what will your business look like tomorrow, and what role will IT play in driving that transformation? Our Technology GDS Summits will answer these questions.<br /><br />GDS Summits are produced following 100+ hours of research calls with 45+ executives from a range of brands and jobs titles to help us form a well-rounded view of what is the most relevant program for both our Delegates and Sponsors.{% endraw %}
