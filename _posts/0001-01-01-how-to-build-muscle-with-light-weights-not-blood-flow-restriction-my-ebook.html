And no: it's not blood flow restriction training (BFR)!<br /><br />We often think we need big weights to build serious muscle, but the reality is quite different.<br /><br />An alternative method for building muscle, is to train with longer rep ranges. This doesn't build strength in the same way that a heavy weight does, but can have a host of other advantages. That's *especially* true if you avoid locking out and maintain a partial range of motion. This is continuous tension, or continuous time under tension. There are specific benefits to training this in an explosive fashion, or in a very slow and controlled fashion. <br /><br />This helps you to build muscle with light weight, because it causes hypoxia: it prevents fresh blood and oxygen from entering the muscle at the usual rate. With less oxygen available, slow twitch muscle fibre gives in quicker. This lets you fatigue the slow twitch fibers AND lets you target and train the faster twitch motor units. Thus: you build muscle with light weights!<br /><br />This also encourages metabolic stress, as the impeded venous return means metabolites build up in the muscle. <br /><br />And yes, in some ways this does work in a similar fashion to blood flow restriction. <br /><br />I think this is the secret formula to building a lot of muscle with only light weights/bodyweight/bands. It's certainly worked for me, as well as for others that I have trained.<br /><br />Let me know what you think in the comments! Would you train this way?<br /><br />The website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com​​">https://www.thebioneer.com​​</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thebioneer​​">https://www.facebook.com/thebioneer​​</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thebioneer​​">https://www.patreon.com/thebioneer​​</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thebioneer​​">https://www.instagram.com/thebioneer​​</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/thebioneer">https://www.twitter.com/thebioneer</a>{% endraw %}
