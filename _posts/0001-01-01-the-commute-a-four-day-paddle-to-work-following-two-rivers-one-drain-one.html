{% raw %}Following two rivers, one drain, one sea and one creek, it turns out that paddling to work, which ends up being mostly a drag, over four full days, is bloody hard work. <br /><br />After a stripped back walk to work (The Commute: walking 90km to work), I decided to continue experimenting between the lands and seas of home and work. This time by paddling. At least, that was the plan; following two rivers, a canal, the sea, and a creek- all the way to my desk. What usually takes 75 minutes by car took four full days of mostly dragging, burning over 18,000 calories. Sleeping by the river, under a train line and next to a boat ramp, the final drag through the suburbs was a full watershed transect, which is an intimate view into all the goods and bads of humanity- including myself. What was another commuting stunt turned out to be the hardest, most insightful four days of travel Iâ€™ve ever done. <br /><br />-<br /><br />Produced and Directed by<br />BEAU MILES<br /> <br />Produced and Edited by<br />MITCH DRUMMOND<br /><br />Filmed by<br />MITCH DRUMMOND<br />CHRIS ORD<br />BEAU MILES<br /><br />Additional Footage<br />SARAH FOLEY<br />BRETT CAMPBELL<br /><br />Final Sound Mix<br />JAMES DOBSON<br /><br />-<br /><br />MUSIC:<br /><br />The Long Wait by Max H<br />Pushing Boundaries by Oran Loyfer<br />Questions by Bell Always<br />Vuelta Al Sol by Tomas Novea<br />Undertow (instrumental) by Low Light<br />First Puesto by Rafael Rico<br />Dont Cheat by The David Roy Collective<br />Seis Continentes by Tomas Novoa<br />Hold (instrumental) by Sasha Daniel<br />Devotion (instrumental) by Skies Speak<br />Belonging by Muted{% endraw %}
