{% raw %}Victrix, a precision rifle company based out of Northern Italy, brings the Tormentum to long range, tactical shooters looking to push past the 1,000-meter mark.<br /><br />On display at SHOT Show hosted in Las Vegas in January, the Victrix is a beast of a rifle chambered in .375 Cheytac and .408 Cheytak. The rifle features a smooth action with heavy bolt designed to withstand the pressures of the larger 300 to 400-grain rounds. The rifle comes with a 5-round magazine.<br /><br />The Tormentum uses a 30-inch barrel to push rounds downrange, clearing the 1,000-meter mark.<br /><br />“It is built as a tactical rifle for long distance shooting and extra long distance shooting,” said Phillip Jones with Beretta USA, who distributes the Victrix series. “This is the rifle you can use when you need to reach out 3,000 meters.<br /><br />In addition to the Tormentum, Victrix also features a selection of tactical precision and bench competition rifles. Models vary from a 16-inch barrel model in .308 to the Gladius tactical rifle chambered in 6.5 Creedmoor.<br /><br />The Tormentum sports a hefty price, hovering under the $10,000 mark.{% endraw %}
