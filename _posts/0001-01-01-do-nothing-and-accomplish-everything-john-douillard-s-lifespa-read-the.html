The sun, while sitting there doing its thing, doesn’t have a vested interest in whether the flowers blossom or you chop down its trees or kill its cattle.<br /><br />Humans, on the other hand, are hardwired to care about their effect on others. In fact, as children, we are genetically hardwired to need mom and dad’s approval. If children did not care about mom and dad’s approval they would carelessly walk into the jungle and get eaten by a lion – and there would be no people!{% endraw %}
