{% raw %}Magic number, epic set! :)<br />Hope you enjoy this 150 minute sonic whirlpool, centered on the remixed album of 'Over the world's clouds' by Yusuke Teranishi, sprinkled with a few other gems from Silk, Emergent Shores, Decompressive, Amulanga and RockRiver.<br />    In 2020, the melodic progressive world was taken by storm by Japan's own, Yusuke Teranishi. His debut album, Over the World's clouds, having followed a streak of buzz-generating EP's and singles, was a successful and eye-opening release that further ventured this talented artist into the top yearly producers.<br />    Fast forward a year later and we're ecstatic to unveil a project the whole progressive community should be proud of, the remixed album of the aforementioned release. Bringing together no less than 18 remixers for stunning renditions, spanning from pure melodic progressive gems, to deeper organic house cuts and inventive melo ambient pieces, this is a joy to listen to from start to end.<br />    Returning here on Synth, this is Yusuke Teranishi with 'Over the world's clouds' in remixed form, a telltale of both our hemispheres coming together within music.<br /><br />Tracklist:<br />[00:00] 1.
