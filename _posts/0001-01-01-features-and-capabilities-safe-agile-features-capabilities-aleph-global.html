{% raw %}#SAFe​ #agile​ #features​ #capabilities​<br />#Features​ and #capabilities​ a #feature​ is a service that fulfills a #stakeholder​ need. Each #feature​ includes a #benefit​ hypothesis and acceptance criteria, and is sized or split as necessary to be delivered by a single #AgileReleaseTrain​ (#ART​) in a #ProgramIncrement​ (#PI​). A #capability​ is a higher-level solution behavior that typically spans multiple arts. #Capabilities​ are sized and split into multiple #features​ to facilitate their #implementation​ in a single #PI​. Features also lend themselves to the #LeanUXprocess​ model, which includes a definition of the #MinimumMarketableFeature​ (#MMF), a benefit hypothesis, and acceptance criteria. The #MMF​ helps limit the scope and investment, enhances #agility​, and provides fast feedback.  #Capabilities​ behave the same way as #features​. However, they are at a higher level of abstraction and support the definition and #development​ of large #solutions​.<br /><br />#Features​ and #capabilities​ are central to the #SAFe​ requirements model. They are critical to defining, planning, and #implementing​ solution value. #Features​ are maintained in the #ProgramBacklog​ and are sized to fit in a #ProgramIncrement​ (#PI​) so that each delivers new value. #Features​ can originate from either the local context of the #AgileReleaseTrain​ (#ART​) or they may result from splitting epics or #capabilities​. The #program​ and #solution​ #KanbanSystems​ support the flow of #features​ and #capabilities​, where they progress through the funnel, analyzing, #backlog​, #implementing​, validating, deployment, and release states. This process provides reasoned economic analysis, technical impact, and strategy for #incremental​ #implementation​. #Productmanagement​ and system architect/engineering own the #features​ and enablers, respectively. #NonfunctionalRequirements​ (#NFRS​) define system attributes such as security, reliability, performance, maintainability, scalability, and usability. #NFRS​ serve as constraints or restrictions on the design of the system across the different #backlogs​. #Features​ are prioritized using #WeightedShortestJobFirst​ (#WSJF​) and are planned and reviewed at #PI boundaries. They are split into stories, and are #implemented​, integrated, tested, and demonstrated as the functionality becomes available.<br /><br />Most of this article is devoted to describing the definition and implementation of features, as they are the most common description of system behavior. #Capabilities exhibit the same characteristics and #practices as #features. For example, they: are described using a phrase and benefit hypotheses are sized to fit within a #PI, however, they often take multiple #ARTs to implement are reasoned about and approved using the solution kanban.  <br /><br />#Aleph Technologies specializes in providing hands-on classroom-based and onsite IT #certification training courses taught by expert instructors with practical industry experience.
