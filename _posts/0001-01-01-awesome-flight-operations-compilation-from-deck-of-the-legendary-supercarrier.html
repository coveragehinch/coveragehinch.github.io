{% raw %}AWESOME SIGHTS &amp; SOUNDS! Aircraft carrier flight operations compilation from the deck of the LEGENDARY ENTERPRISE!<br /><br />We intend for this to serve as the ultimate flight deck operations compilation tribute video to the recently retired USS Enterprise! The longest actively deployed warship in the world – 51 years!<br /><br />Indeed we challenge our viewers to find a better aircraft carrier takeoffs and landings compilation (apart from our video on the F35) than this one! It's got it all – cockpit vision, plus a multitude of other fantastic angles; featuring F/A-18 Super Hornets, S-3 Vikings, E-2 Hawkeyes and more!<br /><br />And also included is rare footage of a United States Navy nuclear powered aircraft carrier – the Enterprise, of course – steaming at full speed!<br /><br />Many thanks for watching,<br /><br />UMC<br /><br />P.S. if you haven't already, perhaps consider turning on upload &quot;notifications&quot; by clicking on the little bell icon. Thanks again.{% endraw %}
