{% raw %}The United Nations has placed a giant statue in New York that seems to resemble an end-times &quot;beast&quot; from the New Testament's book of Revelation. <br /><br />The U.N. recently tweeted a photo of the statue. <br /><br />&quot;A guardian for international peace and security sits on the Visitor's Plaza outside #UN Headquarters. The guardian is a fusion of jaguar and eagle and donated by the Government of Oaxaca, Mexico.&quot;{% endraw %}
