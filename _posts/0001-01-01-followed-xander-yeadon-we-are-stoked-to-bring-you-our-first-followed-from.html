{% raw %}We are stoked to bring you our first Followed from Asia, the city of Hong Kong to be exact, with Xander Yeadon. Join our day with Xander as we catch some waves, get breakfast before bringing the surfboard home via public transportation (what a mission!), where we get a house tour, talk about Olympic skiing and much more. Followed by that we go skate and get a little culinary tour through HK before we wrap it up at Young Soy, the art gallery Xander is running with his friends Shiv and Hosen. There is a lot happening. Enjoy. <br /><br />Filmed &amp; Edited by Patrik Wallner <br />Also Featuring: Dan Leung, Mikey Silva, Felix Landry Yuan, Elton Fung, Oli Rodgers, Ria Chandiramani<br /><br />Get our books &amp; apparel collection here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pocketskatemag.com/shop/">https://pocketskatemag.com/shop/</a><br /><br />Feel free to subscribe to our channel and follow us on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/pocketskatemag">http://www.instagram.com/pocketskatemag</a> <br /><br />Our Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pocketskatemag.com">http://www.pocketskatemag.com</a>{% endraw %}
