His memoirs tell in detail his experiences during that time...the bitter cold, hunger, loss of life, long marches, and fear of battle. He also includes tales of fishing, hunting, and other activities...including encounters with a &quot;saucy miss&quot;. His narrative reveals much about American life at the time and is one of the fullest and best accounts of the Revolutionary War, presented from a private's point of view.<br /><br />The book has been later republished under the names Private Yankee Doodle and Memoir of a Revolutionary Soldier.
