{% raw %}Following the suspension of his campaign due to security concerns, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the forthcoming Anambra election, Senator #NnamdiUba, finally kicked off his electioneering across the state this week.<br /><br />The former senator and ex-presidential aide, who is better known as Andy Uba, is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that he crisscrosses the length and breadth of the state and convinces the electorate to vote for him.<br /><br />However, the normally taciturn and media-shy politician will certainly have his work cut out, as his party – the APC – has remained hugely unpopular despite past attempts to make in-roads in Anambra.<br /><br />He will also have to contend with political heavyweights such as Prof #CharlesChukwumaSoludo, candidate of the ruling All Progressives Grand Alliance, and #ValOzigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party, who both have more grassroots support in the state.<br /><br />Director, Media and Publicity of the Andy Uba Campaign Organisation, Hon Afam Ogene discusses his plans for Anambra and his chances of winning in his third attempt to govern the state.<br /><br />Hon. Ogene is a member of the APC and a former member of the House of Representatives.<br /><br />#apc #andyuba #TheMorningShow  #ReubenAbati #TundunAbiola  #RufaiOseni #rotusoddiri #michaelwilson #adesuaomoruan<br />#nigeria #nigerians #dailynews #news #globalnews<br />#NIGERIANNEWS #TRENDING #trendingvideo<br /><br />Subscribe to our Channel for high profile interviews.
