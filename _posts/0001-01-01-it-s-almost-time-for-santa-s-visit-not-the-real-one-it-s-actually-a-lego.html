If you've just dropped by, I'm Ellie! Stick around and I'll build for you while I review new sets. I tend to geek out about new pieces, interesting building techniques, giggle too much and just generally ramble. I'm easily distracted so I get stuff wrong which I fix up, mostly, but in the end there is always an awesome model ready for play and display.
