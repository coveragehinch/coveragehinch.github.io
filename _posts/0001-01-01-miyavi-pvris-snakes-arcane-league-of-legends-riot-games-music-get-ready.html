{% raw %}Get ready to fight with PVRIS and Miyavi's &quot;Snakes&quot; off the Arcane Original Soundtrack.<br /><br />Riot Games presents Arcane, a new animated streaming television series on Netflix from the world of League of Legends. In the cities of Piltover and Zaun, unrest stirs as inventors and thieves, politicians and crime lords chafe against the constraints of a society torn asunder. As dissent reaches a fever pitch, two sisters steal an artifact of untold power. Discovery and danger intertwine as heroes are born and bonds are broken. Will this power change the world, or lead it to ruin? This is the world of Arcane. Champions Jinx and Vi struggle to overcome their shared past in a new era of magic and technology.<br /><br />PRODUCTION CREDITS<br />Snakes<br />Featured artist: Miyavi &amp; PVRIS <br />Written by: Lyndsey Gerd Gunnulfsen, Takamasa Ishihara<br />Produced by: JT Daly<br />Vocals by: Lyndsey Gerd Gunnulfsen<br />Mixed by: Adam Hawkins<br />Mastered by: Randy Merrill (Sterling Sound, NYC)<br /><br />PVRIS appears courtesy of Warner Records<br />MIYAVI appears courtesy of Virgin Music<br /><br />LISTEN NOW: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/snakes">https://found.ee/snakes</a>      <br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/snakes-spotify">https://found.ee/snakes-spotify</a><br />Apple Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/snakes-applemusic">https://found.ee/snakes-applemusic</a><br />Amazon Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/snakes-amazonmusic">https://found.ee/snakes-amazonmusic</a><br />Youtube Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/snakes-youtube">https://found.ee/snakes-youtube</a><br />Deezer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/snakes-deezer">https://found.ee/snakes-deezer</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thisispvris">https://www.instagram.com/thisispvris</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/miyavi_ishihara">https://www.instagram.com/miyavi_ishihara</a><br /><br />LYRICS<br />Know you got my blood running<br />Turn the heat to 600<br />Wish I could knock your skull in<br />But I’m rising above it<br />know you’ll crash it and burn it<br />God knows you didn’t earn it<br />My friend karma’s a bitch<br />She’s got some lessons you’ll learn ‘em<br /><br />Now we’re enemies<br />You’re a snake you’re a snake<br />I can see it in your face<br /><br />Do you feel no shame?<br />Can’t you see my rage?<br />You’re a snake you’re a snake<br />Just like a spitting image<br />Fate, how’s it taste?<br />It’s your own medicine<br />Make no mistakes<br />Got 2020 vision<br />If I see your face<br />Don't think I’m forgiving<br /><br />It’s time we had a discussion<br />‘Bout your sorry production<br />Mask your shade and corruption<br />grinning teeth lack seduction<br />know the crime you committed<br />I forget not forgive it<br />Don’t you dare get it twisted<br />I’m nice but I can get wicked<br /><br />Now we’re enemies<br /><br />Do you feel no shame?<br />Can’t you see my rage?<br />You’re a snake you’re a snake<br />Just like a spitting image<br />Fate, how’s it taste?<br />It’s your own medicine<br />Make no mistakes<br />Got 2020 vision<br />If I see your face<br />Don't think I’m forgiving<br /><br />You’re a snake you’re a snake<br />I can see it in your face<br />You’re a snake you’re a snake<br />I can see it in your face<br />You’re a snake you’re a snake<br />I can see it in your face<br />You’re a snake you’re a snake<br />I can see it in your face<br /><br />From Arcane League of Legends, Soundtrack from the Animated Series<br />November 6 // November 13 // November 20<br />The #Arcane soundtrack drops in three releases.{% endraw %}
