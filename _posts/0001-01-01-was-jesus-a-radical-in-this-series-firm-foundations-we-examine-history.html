{% raw %}In this series, Firm Foundations, we examine history and doctrine pertaining to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We examine the LDS (Mormon) faith and culture in order to separate the facts from the fiction in LDS history and doctrine. <br /><br />While the creators of the show are members of the LDS church, this show is not affiliated with or endorsed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We strive to be independent critics, learning about and explaining Mormon culture and history, and sometimes calling for changes to ideas and assumptions we hold as members when the evidence doesn’t back up our long-held myths or ideas about the church, it’s policies, or it’s leaders. <br /><br />Jesus Christ is a very controversial figure?  When he came to earth as the Messiah, he restored principles and doctrine that was new, and in some ways radical to his followers.  So, what did Jesus do to shock his disciples? Find out in this episode. <br /><br />In every video we carefully craft the scripts and fact-check our stories. We examine facts, scriptures, doctrinal sources, historical documents, modern surveys, psychology, and scientific data. Hannah and Stephen, as the writers, interpret this information and crafts it into a factually accurate, but interesting and dynamic episode.  It is important to our mission that we not sugar coat or ignore facts, and that we include all pertinent information and use empathy when examining individuals’ choices. We want to empower you to do the same.  <br /><br />Let’s keep in touch!
