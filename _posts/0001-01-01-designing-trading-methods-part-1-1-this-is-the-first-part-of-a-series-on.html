{% raw %}This is the first part of a series on how to design your own trading methods. These methods can be from what you have observed in price flow, or they can be methods you have learned and want to adapt to your needs the way you see. It's beneficial for us to participate in the authorship of the trading methods we use, and to make them ours. <br /><br />Whatever we design will have to adhere to the principles of price flow. For example, everything moves in contraction/expansion and all market structure is a derivative of gaps and swings. From this observation, we can start to build on solid foundations and come up with numerous methods.   <br /><br />In this video, I want us to get a solid understanding of how price moves in a swing cycle. A swing moves in process and each part of the process has its own components and characteristics. If we understand this, we can design methods and tactics for various parts of that cycle. <br /><br />Shane{% endraw %}
