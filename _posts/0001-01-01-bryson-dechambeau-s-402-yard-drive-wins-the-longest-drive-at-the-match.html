{% raw %}In Capital One’s The Match, Bryson DeChambeau's 402-yard drive wins the Longest Drive.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh">http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka’s well publicised rivalry will come to a head this weekend, as the pair face off in the fifth edition of ‘The Match’. The players head to Wynn Golf Club in Las Vegas for the 12-hole match play exhibition, with both having won eight times on the TOUR. Four of Brooks’ victories have been at major championships, with the most recent of these coming at the PGA Championship in 2019, while DeChambeau’s single major came at the US Open in 2020. World No.7 DeChambeau and World No.16 Brooks appeared to have potentially buried the hatchet at the Ryder Cup in September, with a post-victory hug, however there is no doubt that the two fierce competitors will be wanting to come away victorious when they go head-to-head in this post-Thanksgiving spectacle. <br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to the official YouTube channel of the PGA TOUR.<br /><br /><br /><br />Here you can find everything you need to stay up to date with the world’s foremost golf tour.
