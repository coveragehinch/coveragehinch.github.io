We start out by travelling from our homes to London Heathrow. At Heathrow, we check-in to the Hilton Garden Inn at Terminals 2 &amp; 3 for an overnight stay before our flight. There we give you a room tour, explain the process leading up to our departure regarding Covid-19 testing, vaccination certificates and attestation forms. We get dinner at the The Apron Restaurant inside the Hilton and then wind down with a questionable cup of tea.<br /><br />On our full travel day, we make our way from the hotel over to Terminal 3 via the underground subway. Upon arriving at the Virgin Atlantic/Delta check-in, we proceed to the premium economy line, where we encounter a reasonably long wait. Thanks to some early planning, we had no trouble checking in here as we were 'FlyReady' passengers, having uploaded our documents ahead of time via the Virgin Atlantic booking page and TrustAssure (which became active 72 hours prior to departure).<br /><br />At the check-in desk, I needed to show our 'Fly Ready' confirmation, attestation form confirmation and the address of where we'll be staying in the US. I'd recommend planning to get to the airport 4 hours prior to departure, rather than the recommended 3. Just as the wait was very long. After check-in, we pass through security, pop into a couple of shops and then to No.1 lounge. There we give you a little look at the lounge and tell you whether we thought it was worth the money or not.<br /><br />Our flight was 30 minutes delayed, due to the aircraft getting into the gate later than expected. We flew on an A330 (Goldern Girl) that was in good standing in 18A and 18C (the bulkhead seats for this particular aircraft and layout). We got chatting to the lovely Lora who took great care of us during the flight. Onboard the flight we share an overview of the experience and review the inflight meal. As for masks, we didn't mind them as much as we thought we would. Obviously we'd have been more comfortable without them, but you do forget your wearing paper masks in time.<br /><br />Upon arriving in Orlando we were treated to a very short wait at immigration but about a 30 minute wait for our bags. Aboard the tram we hear the nostalgic announcement by Buddy Dyer, before checking into Disney's magical express. The line was long for magical express but we got through to the coach pretty quickly and were the first stop on the route. This service will be discontinued December 31st 2021 and replaced by the paid Mears Connect service. We're not sure yet which service/transport we'll use on future trips.<br /><br />Upon arriving at Art of Animation, we check-in to our Cars suite and give you a full room-tour of the suite. Once the bags were dropped, we popped into the Ink &amp; Paint merchandise store and enjoyed a great quick service meal at Landscape of Flavors. Gary had chicken tenders and I had a pulled pork burger, both were amazing and mad us super happy!<br /><br />Lots more Disney magic is coming in this series, so be sure to subscribe and set reminders by clicking the bell icon.
