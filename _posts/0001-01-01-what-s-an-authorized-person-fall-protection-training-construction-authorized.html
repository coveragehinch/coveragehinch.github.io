We know that OSHA doesn’t always put things in the clearest terms, so we wanted to make it easy to understand for everyone.<br /><br />In this Tailgate-Safety-Topic we talk about one of the most important roles in a fall prevention program, specifically about the authorized person and how they can make sure your workers are as safe as possible when working from heights. More than 1000 people die every year due to falls from heights on construction sites, and in this video we teach you how to prevent falls and improve your fall prevention program.<br /><br />We hope this tailgate safety video helps you better understand the necessary components of any fall prevention plan and how to prevent falls on construction sites.
