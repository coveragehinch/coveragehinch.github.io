{% raw %}What questions do you ask a living memory cell of the universe? Matías De Stefano is a person I intend to have as many conversations with as possible. In the few days I spent with him, one podcast was not enough, so we invited him to do another podcast (live) to kick off our Fit For Service Summit in Sedona. In this profound conversation, we dive into the concepts of sacred union, the body as a manifestation of spirit, our ancient and current outlooks on death, and so much more. It’s such an honor to be able to access the wisdom of Matías De Stefano and all he has remembered from his cosmic existence. We opened the last part of the podcast for Q &amp; A from the audience, and Matías had answers that will blow your mind. <br /><br /><br />Check out the YOSOY four day event in Egypt | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://yosoy2022.org">https://yosoy2022.org</a><br /><br /><br />Connect with Matías DeStefano<br />Website | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.matiasdestefano.org">https://www.matiasdestefano.org</a><br />Instagram | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/matiasgustavodestefano/">https://www.instagram.com/matiasgustavodestefano/</a><br />YouTube | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ghancaA">https://www.youtube.com/user/ghancaA</a><br /><br />| Aubrey Marcus |<br /><br />► Own The Day, Own Your Life: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2vRz4so">http://bit.ly/2vRz4so</a><br /><br />► Aubrey Marcus Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2ns8zFP">https://apple.co/2ns8zFP</a><br /><br />► Ayahuasca Documentary: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2OrNBTf">http://bit.ly/2OrNBTf</a><br /><br />► Aubrey Marcus Collection: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Mvctc5">http://bit.ly/2Mvctc5</a><br /><br />►Aubrey Marcus Poetry: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2My1ezC">http://bit.ly/2My1ezC</a><br /><br />►Aubrey Marcus Binaural Beats: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2vVc3EC">http://bit.ly/2vVc3EC</a><br /><br /><br /><br />#OwnTheDay<br /><br />#TotalHumanOptimization<br /><br />#Podcast<br /><br />#AubreyMarcus<br /><br />#Fitness<br /><br />#Training<br /><br />#GetOnnit<br /><br />#Onnit<br /><br /><br /><br />| Listen to the Aubrey Marcus Podcast |<br /><br />►iTunes | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2lMZRCn">https://apple.co/2lMZRCn</a><br /><br />►Stitcher | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2G8ccJt">http://bit.ly/2G8ccJt</a><br /><br /><br /><br />| Connect with Aubrey |<br /><br />►Website | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2GesYqi">http://bit.ly/2GesYqi</a><br /><br />►Instagram | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2BlfCEO">http://bit.ly/2BlfCEO</a><br /><br />►Facebook | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2F4nBZk">http://bit.ly/2F4nBZk</a><br /><br />►Twitter | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2BlGBAdAd">http://bit.ly/2BlGBAdAd</a><br /><br /><br /><br />========================================­=====<br /><br /><br /><br />About the Podcast<br /><br />Founder of Onnit and modern philosopher Aubrey Marcus asks the important questions:  How do we find our purpose, wake up to who we truly are, have a few more laughs, and human being a little better?<br /><br />The Aubrey Marcus Podcast brings in world-class guests from the fields of athletics, health, business, fitness, science, relationship and spirituality, and asks them to open up about the failures and successes that define their wisdom and character.<br /><br />Follow me on social to keep up with the latest, and meet many of the incredible guests we’ve been honored to have on the show.{% endraw %}
