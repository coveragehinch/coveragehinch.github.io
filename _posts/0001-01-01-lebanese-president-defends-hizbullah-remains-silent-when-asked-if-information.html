{% raw %}On November 30, 2021, Al-Jazeera Network (Qatar) aired an interview with Lebanese President Michel Aoun. President Aoun said that Hizbullah represents one third of the Lebanese population, and that it has done nothing wrong and hurt nobody within Lebanese territory. He said that Hizbullah has respected the local law and that it has fully adhered to U.N. Resolution 1701, which calls for the disarmament of militias in Lebanon. Later in the interview, President Aoun was asked if Information Minister George Kurdahi, whose recent statements have caused a crisis of relations between Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, is being asked to resign from his position, like former Lebanese Foreign Minister Charbel Wehbe had been asked to resign after making statements that similarly inflamed Lebanonâ€™s relations with other Arab countries (see MEMRITV clip no 8857 for more information). President Aoun remained silent and did not answer the question.{% endraw %}
