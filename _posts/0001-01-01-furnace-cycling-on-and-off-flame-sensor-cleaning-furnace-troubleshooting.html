{% raw %}For a furnace that is cycling on and off, the problem is usually the flame sensor. By removing the flame sensor and cleaning it, you can get your furnace to cycle properly.<br /><br />Turn off the power to your furnace before you remove the flame sensor and turn it back on after it's been replaced.<br /><br />When you remove the flame sensor, try not to touch the rod and clean it with a slightly abrasive material. You can use sandpaper or emery cloth. Make sure to wipe off any sanding dust with a dry clean cloth.<br /><br />Clean your flame sensor once a year and you will add life to the sensor.<br /><br />Subscribe and visit our Fix It Home Improvement podcast on iTunes or Stitcher <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/fix-it-home-improvement/id880903087?mt=2">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/fix-it-home-improvement/id880903087?mt=2</a>{% endraw %}
