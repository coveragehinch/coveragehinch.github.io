{% raw %}For this build, Jay Clark from dirtbiketv1 wanted to build the ultimate &quot;do-all&quot; bike and his weapon of choice is this 2021 GASGAS EX350. This platform is the same basics as the KTM 350SXF with a wider ratio transmission and an additional 6th gear over the full moto models.<br /><br />For the motor on this build, Jay opted to not go to his old reliable Cylinder Works big bore but go with a standard bore mod with Jamie Ellis at Twisted Development. Jay does admit that the stock EX350 is great as is. However, for those looking to have the ultimate in power for the track or trail is what Jamie does. Head porting and a “mapped” Vortex ECU are the keys to those power gains and lack of flame-out/stalling on the trail. A Blais Racing clutch weight helps in this area as well.  <br /><br />For the Suspension Jay went to Race Tech with a set of KYB conversions from Technical Touch to bypass the stock air forks.<br /><br />For the complete in-depth article, head on over to Vitalmx.com to check out this build and some of the key components used.   <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gopro.com/en/us">https://gopro.com/en/us</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero9-black/CHDHX-901-master.html">https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero9-black/CHDHX-901-master.html</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />MB01RP9JQYFCM7D{% endraw %}
