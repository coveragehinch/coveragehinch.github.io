{% raw %}I didn't get a chance to say in the video but i think this entire channel has been leading up to this and I can't say how excited I am to do something like this. I grew up watching Dukes of Hazzard and to have a platform to continue this is amazing. Watch my dad and grandpa take it for a spin in the next video. #DUKESOFHAZZARD{% endraw %}
