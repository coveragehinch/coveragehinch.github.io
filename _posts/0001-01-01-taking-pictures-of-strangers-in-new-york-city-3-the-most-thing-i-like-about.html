{% raw %}The most thing I like about taking pictures of strangers is interacting and meeting new people. <br /><br />You guys loved the two videos and asked for more, and here is more. And I will keep it coming with your love and support ♥️ <br /><br />Thank you everyone...<br /><br />Tiktok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thatwaszak?">https://www.tiktok.com/@thatwaszak?</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thatwaszak/">https://www.instagram.com/thatwaszak/</a><br /><br />Brett Conti Channel : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/brettconti">https://www.youtube.com/c/brettconti</a><br />The VIP list Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheVIPList">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheVIPList</a> <br />#thatwaszak #streetphotography #strangers{% endraw %}
