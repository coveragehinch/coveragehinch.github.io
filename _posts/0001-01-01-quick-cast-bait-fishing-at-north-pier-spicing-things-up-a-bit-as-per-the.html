{% raw %}Spicing things up a bit as per the publics' requests, The Crow carried a bait set up along with his drop shot kit for a quick morning session before work.<br />Arriving on a low tide was a concern but none the less he fished on.<br />The plan was to get a bait out whilst drop-shotting alongside.<br /><br />Rigging up his NEW Okuma Precision 14.6ft rod for a cast intended for an edible, <br />his first cast was pecked clean, <br />his second he hooked up into a  skate, <br />the third cast he hooked up into something big which reefed him in a matter of seconds,<br />his fourth cast was a Gernie lol....<br />Undergunned and with only 3 baits he called it in speeding off to work .... <br />WE WILL BE BACK and this time The VeerMan will be there lol <br /><br />Landing these skates by yourself of the rocks is challenging and The crow tried his best to handle the ray into a quick release.<br /><br />thanks for watching out adventures... stay tuned{% endraw %}
