{% raw %}An impactful demonstration with hundreds of students in Overland Park, Kansas, aimed to get the attention of adults. “We're kids still and we want to be protected by the adults who should be in charge. And they're not doing the jobs that they shouldn't be doing,” said one student. They urged school leaders to take action following sexual assault allegations on and off campus. The district said it is aware of their concerns and are planning conversations between students and school counselors.{% endraw %}
