{% raw %}Illinois vs Penn State was not a game anyone had circled entering Saturday's week 8 College Football slate, but by the time lunch had settled all eyes were on State College as Bret Bielema and the Fighting Illini took down James Franklin's Penn State team before a stunned crowd in Happy Valley. On Late Kick Live Ep 195 Josh Pate looked back on the struggles of the Nittany Lions Saturday and discussed what the current issues with this team are, whether they're correctable, and what Penn State has left on the schedule. Where will Penn State go from here? How does this loss rank among the most disappointing outcomes in recent memory?
