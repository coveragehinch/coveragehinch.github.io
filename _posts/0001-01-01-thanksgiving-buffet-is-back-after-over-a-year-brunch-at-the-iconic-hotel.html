As fall approaches, the weather is getting a little wet and a little cold, but very thankful as well because Thanksgiving if just around the corner.  For those in Canada, I hope you all had a great thanksgiving and to those in the United States, wishing you a very happy thanksgiving to come!  <br /><br />And certainly, this year, there is a lot to be thankful for; things are getting back to normal, many good friends and family sticking together through the last year, and to top it off, Vancouver's iconic hotel has just announced that after over 18 months, they are bringing back their buffet, starting with the Thanksgiving Brunch Buffet!<br /><br />Very glad to enjoy but bounty of fresh seafoods, meats, and the fall harvest of vegetables and produce.  Enjoying the magnificent salmon and crab, luscious prime rib and turkey, and endless desserts and drinks.
