{% raw %}In an effort to make driving 4x4's more efficient, we design a post driving cap to protect the top while we strike it with a sledgehammer. The only problem is that we're pretty bad at fabrication. If we can get this working, it will help us build mountain bike features just a little easier!<br /><br />Berm Peak Hoodies, Beanies, Jerseys, Shirts<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection">https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection</a><br /><br />Want us to review your unique mountain bike or outdoor product? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sethsbikehacks.com/product-review/">https://www.sethsbikehacks.com/product-review/</a><br /><br />Check out our main channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/sethsbikehacks">https://youtube.com/c/sethsbikehacks</a><br />Follow me on Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sethsbikehacks">https://instagram.com/sethsbikehacks</a><br />Berm Peak Merch <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection">https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection</a><br /><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks">https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks</a><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/sethsbikehacks">https://www.facebook.com/sethsbikehacks</a><br /><br />Music in this video is from <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg">http://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg</a><br />and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundstripe.com?fpr=seth20">https://soundstripe.com?fpr=seth20</a><br /><br />Support Berm Park!
