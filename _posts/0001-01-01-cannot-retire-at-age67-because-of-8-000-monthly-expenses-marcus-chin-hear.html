{% raw %}Marcus Chin, 67, Has To Pay S$5,000 A Month In Alimony &amp; Child Support. Shares why he still lives in a rented room. When we see the headline, the quick conclusion is that he is broke.<br />$5,000 maintenance charges is an amount most people would find it hard to sustain. This is a good topic with learning points for all.<br /><br />0:00 Some background on Marcus<br />He started his career in the 1970s and joined SAF music and drama company and subsequently SBC which was before mediacorp in 1973. Then, he was a budding singer.<br /><br />Marcus shared that in 1970s and 1980s he was raking in big money. Per night, he would be paid USD$400 for Indonesia gigs and one trip he'd net easily USD$20k. That was in 1980s.<br /><br />He was really a high income guy so the next question is where is the money?<br />Quite simple, he spent it all away, not on himself but with anyone around him. Bags/gifts ‚Äì luxury life we see in celebrities who blow through their income<br /><br />But it is not just that. <br />In 1990s he joined a MLM, at the peak he was raking in $40,000/month. That business folded because it violated commercial law . He was once again left with nothing.<br /><br />3:16 FIRST LESSON: It doesn‚Äôt matter how much income, if you spend income you can be broke<br />The way to spend is spend investment return. If you get $10k from investment dividends go ahead and spend it, youd never be broker. <br />Those who are visitors to wealth and those who stay there permanently. <br /><br />Agree? Smash like!<br /><br />Relationships got him into a financial mess with $5,000/m paid out. <br />When Jack Neo offered him a way back into Media, he took it to rebuild from scratch.<br /><br />4:50 SECOND LESSON: Importance of emergency cash.<br />Especially if you are self employed you need more. Gigs can stop. Older you need more, jobs are harder to come by.<br /><br />Marcus Chin &quot;Hear U Out&quot; Interview: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GfsiR0loo0c">https://youtu.be/GfsiR0loo0c</a><br /><br />#marcuschin #broke <br /><br />******<br /><br /><br />Catch this episode on SPOTIFY, Listen in to our conversations with Josh Tan  üëè<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7Hdw7jmi6vLvTt7IQP9Bn3">https://open.spotify.com/show/7Hdw7jmi6vLvTt7IQP9Bn3</a><br /><br />******<br />We do not make any recommendations on whether a security is a buy/sell as every investor has different investment goals and risk profiles.
