{% raw %}It is always a surprise when a video game over-delivers, and Far Cry 6 disappoints in spades. It had an interesting core premise, but sadly the games ambitions were frustrated by minor setbacks. (it's a horrendous, preachy, woke,  incoherent abomination, with terrible combat, ridiculous weapon modelling, cliched mechanics, tiresome activities, obnoxious characters, a dreadful narrative, all cobbled together by the lowest outsourced bidders, using drool and chewing gum. It is also very VERY boring.)<br /><br />Special thanks to Mario J. Martinez, Archangel, Theron, Jason T Barnes, Dean McGee, Steve, Alcoholistair, RageDMX47, Hector Salamanca, Corvo Fox-Gray, FatCat1, Anna Lovatt, Michael Pearce, ATR-42 and all of my Patreon supporters. Their stoic support humbles me.<br /><br />Support the channel on Patreon<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/21Kiloton">https://www.patreon.com/21Kiloton</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/21Kiloton">https://twitter.com/21Kiloton</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/21kiloton">https://www.twitch.tv/21kiloton</a><br />Channel Art by Vlammenzee <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Vlammenzee">https://twitter.com/Vlammenzee</a><br />Intro Sting by SashoMedia <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/sashomedia">https://twitter.com/sashomedia</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pedocache">https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pedocache</a>{% endraw %}
