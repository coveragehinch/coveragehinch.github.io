{% raw %}This game started off so freaking exciting. We used Bodyguards and Sunfire to push with 100 HP into the end game with some exciting plays and a strong end game. And then...to be honest...I kinda choked and fell back into a lame finish. Didn't hit the Gunblade for TK, and used Kai'sa to win it. Felt me...but still worth sharing!<br /><br />Originally Aired: Patch 11.24 NA - December 26th, 2021<br /><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/mortdog">https://www.twitch.tv/mortdog</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Mortdog">https://twitter.com/Mortdog</a><br /><br />Outro Song by Defcat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1pBeDm1Lbk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1pBeDm1Lbk</a><br /><br />#TFT<br />#TeamfightTactics<br />#Mortdog{% endraw %}
