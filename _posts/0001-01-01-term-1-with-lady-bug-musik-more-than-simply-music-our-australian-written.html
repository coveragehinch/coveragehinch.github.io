{% raw %}Our Australian written programs are choc-a-block full of more than simply music. There's: movement, art play, instrument time, dancing, rhymes, visual aids, puppetry, dress ups, lots of giggles, and even sign language!<br />We love babies, toddlers, preschoolers, and their caregivers, coming and learning all about music (and life) together. So, come and join the Lady Bug Musik family.{% endraw %}
