{% raw %}Welcome aboard the Zurich S-Bahn Service S11 from Wila in Zurich Highlands to Aarau, the capital of canton Aargau. Today we're not only driving from A to B, but you will have insights into our operation and get to ride in a non-public passenger train for a little. We are approaching the evening rush hour, so we're preparing our trains by coupling them to other units. This is done to cope with the many passengers during the busy rush hour. Sounds interesting, right? Everything you should know is explained in the video during the operation. After a little preparation work, we're diving into rush hour ourselves. The sun sets while we're on our way to Aarau, a perfect recipe for a trip with a lot of variety and beautiful sights. Sit back and enjoy the ride!<br /><br />Locomotive/EMU: Stadler KISS160 (RABe 511)<br /><br />Train stops at:<br />Wila<br />Turbenthal<br />RÃ¤mismÃ¼hle-Zell<br />Rikon<br />Kollbrunn<br />Sennhof-Kyburg<br />Winterthur Seen<br />coupling trains, heading back to Sennhof-Kyburg<br />Winterthur Seen<br />Winterthur GrÃ¼ze<br />Winterthur<br />Stettbach<br />Zurich Stadelhofen<br />Zurich Main Station<br />Zurich HardbrÃ¼cke<br />Zurich Altstetten<br />Schlieren<br />Glanzenberg<br />Dietikon<br />Killwangen-Spreitenbach<br />Mellingen Heitersberg<br />MÃ¤genwil<br />Othmarsingen<br />Lenzburg<br />Aarau<br /><br />Any questions?
