{% raw %}Locked Up with Dignity? Canada's Federal Prison for Women (Crime Documentary) | Real Stories<br /><br />Locked Up with Dignity? Canada's Federal Prison for Women (Crime Documentary) | Real Stories<br /><br />This documentary takes us inside the walls of Grand Valley Institutionâ€”one of five federal prisons for women in Canada. Here, most residents live in small shared houses, in an environment that is supposed to be female-friendly. The film features three unforgettable women over age 50 doing time in a system that can seem designed to frustrate and baffle. Vietnamese Kim struggles with translation and awaits a parole board hearing that seems to never come, while Pearl relies on her faith in God to stay positive throughout the hard reality of prison life. Finally, T.A.'s larger-than-life outlook serves her well, whether she's fighting for greater access and rights for prisoners or composing and performing her own country-tinged musical compositions. While the film doesn't idealize these flawed characters, it also advances the notion that those who have committed crimes deserve to be treated with dignity.<br /><br />From Life Inside Out<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/realstoriesdocs">https://twitter.com/realstoriesdocs</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RealStoriesChannel">https://www.facebook.com/RealStoriesChannel</a><br />Instagram - @realstoriesdocs<br /><br />Real Stories Shorts: Real Stories has a new channel for digestible, bite-sized documentary content!
