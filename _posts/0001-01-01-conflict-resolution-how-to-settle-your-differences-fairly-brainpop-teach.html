{% raw %}Teach your students how to resolve their differences with negotiation and compromise, and why it's a bad thing to always get your way: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brnpop.co/34E5tot">https://brnpop.co/34E5tot</a><br /><br />People are not always going to get along everyone. And anger and frustration are natural human emotions, so there’s no way to avoid feeling them. But there are ways to disagree without being disagreeable—and in this BrainPOP movie on conflict resolution, Tim and Moby will teach your students all about them! <br /><br />Students will find out why it’s a good idea to take a deep breath and collect themselves before they respond to a situation they're not thrilled about. They'll discover different ways to compromise, and how placing themselves in another person’s shoes can change a potential screaming match into a friendly discussion. <br /><br />---------<br /><br />Visit the #ConflictResolution topic on #BrainPOP for accompanying creative and instructional tools that develop higher-order thinking skills in kids K–12: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brnpop.co/34E5tot">https://brnpop.co/34E5tot</a><br /><br />---------<br /><br />Subscribe to BrainPOP on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brnpop.co/2TplJUG">https://brnpop.co/2TplJUG</a><br /><br />Follow BrainPOP:<br />Facebook | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brainpopofficial">https://www.facebook.com/brainpopofficial</a><br />Twitter | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/brainpop">https://twitter.com/brainpop</a><br />Instagram | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/brainpop_official">https://instagram.com/brainpop_official</a><br /><br />Have questions?
