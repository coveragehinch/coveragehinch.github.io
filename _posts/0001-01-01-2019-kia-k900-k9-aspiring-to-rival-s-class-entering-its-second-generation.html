{% raw %}Entering its second generation, the 2019 Kia K900 receives a new grille, bigger proportions, and more luxurious features befitting a flagship sedan. The new K900 will make its world debut at the New York auto show on March 28.<br /><br />The K900 receives a new design that makes it more distinct from other models in the Kia lineup. A new grille features 176 jewel-like cells, which Kia says are “suggestive of released energy accelerating from the center.”<br /><br />Unlike the rounded headlights on its predecessor, the new K900 has squared-off headlights. Chrome adorns the base of the doors, the window frame, lower rear section, and the exhaust housings. The taillights are now oriented vertically and remind us a little of the lights on the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.<br /><br />Sitting on a new platform, the new K900 is longer and wider than the previous version, with a wheelbase that is 2.3 inches bigger. Kia also made the front and rear overhangs shorter and pushed the wheels farther out to the corners of the car. These changes help improve ride quality and open up space inside the cabin, Kia says. Although we have praised the K900 for its comfortable cabin, we hope Kia has improved the sedan’s steering and fixed some of its body roll problems for the new generation.<br /><br />Inside, the cabin boasts a wrap-around design in which wood and metal veneers blend seamlessly from the doors to the dashboard. Look for genuine leather upholstery with quilted surfaces, a new steering wheel, and a new analog clock designed in collaboration with Swiss watch brand Maurice Lacroix.<br /><br />The new 12.3-inch HMI screen can be controlled by a manual dial on the base of the center console. Drivers can select one of seven colors for ambient lighting, and there are 64 different ways to alter light levels in the cabin. Expect a simplified array of buttons compared to the previous version.<br /><br />Expect the K900 to be closely related to the Genesis G90. It could receive the same engines, including a 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6 or a 5.0-liter V-8.<br /><br />Kia will manufacture the new flagship sedan in Korea. Although we’re not sure of exact timing for the U.S., Kia says the vehicle will go on sale across different global markets starting from the second quarter of this year.<br /><br />► Discover all new cars before anyone else! <br /> &quot;SUBSCRIBE NOW&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/TmQGGe">https://goo.gl/TmQGGe</a>{% endraw %}
