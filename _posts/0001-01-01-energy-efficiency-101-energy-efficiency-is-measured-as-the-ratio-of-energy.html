{% raw %}Energy efficiency is measured as the ratio of energy output to energy input, as a percentage. The goal of improving energy efficiency is to deliver the same service to the end user, using less energy. Learn more about energy efficiency at www.studentenergy.org<br /><br />Thank you to the Alberta Real Estate Foundation for sponsoring this episode of the Energy Systems Map.<br /><br />--------<br /><br />Student Energy is currently developing the Global Youth Energy Outlook, a global youth-led report that will engage 50,000 young people around the world in 2021 to gather their perspectives on energy. Want to take part? If youâ€™re between 18-30, head to www.bit.ly/gyeo to complete the survey! You can win $100 cash prizes in each region, or a fully funded trip to the next International Student Energy Summit!<br /><br />Student Energy is a global youth-led organization empowering the next generation of leaders who are accelerating the transition to a sustainable, equitable energy future. We work with a network of 50,000 young people from over 120 countries to build the knowledge, skills, and networks they need to take action on energy.
