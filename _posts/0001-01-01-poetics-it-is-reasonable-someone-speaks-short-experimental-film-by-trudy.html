{% raw %}Short experimental film by Trudy Clutterbok.<br /><br />Shot on the Western Highway.<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Poetry rises<br /><br /><br /><br />Poetics.  It is reasonable. Someone speaks<br /><br /> it contains, poetry, all other ideas, it remains<br /><br /><br /><br />Someone speaks<br /><br /><br /><br />Only ideas that are related to freedom are considered ideas<br /><br /><br /><br />Political ideas are not ideas as they treat people like machines&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The aesthetic act is the highest form of reason and as such is able to contain all other ideas in it. The author of The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism (1797) (Hegel, Schelling or Hoderlin ) writes that only an idea that has to do with freedom can be considered as an idea. Governance and politics treats people like machines thus political ideas are not considered ideas.{% endraw %}
