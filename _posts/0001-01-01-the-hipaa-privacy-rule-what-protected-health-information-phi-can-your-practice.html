{% raw %}What Protected Health Information, PHI, can your practice share without receiving a patient’s consent?  Does your practice need special agreements in place before sharing patient information?  What rights do patients have regarding their PHI?  These are all questions covered and addressed under HIPAA’s Privacy Rule.  The Privacy Rule creates specific standards to protect patient information.<br /><br />Patient privacy continues to evolve and practices must follow strict guidelines in order to protect patient information and the practice’s reputation.  In order to comply with HIPAA Law, you must have specific policies and procedures in place to properly control, disclose and protect PHI. HIPAA’s Privacy Rule defines specific rights for individuals regarding their PHI and obligates covered entities and their business associates to comply with protecting their information.  <br /><br />As a general rule, patients must authorize any disclosure of their PHI.  This includes all individually identifiable health information.  However, HIPAA’s Privacy Rule is not designed to interfere with the treatment of patients.  Doctors, nurses, dentists, labs, specialists and other healthcare providers can all freely discuss treatment plans and health status.  They can share information to treat us, get paid, and run routine healthcare operations.  This is referred to as TPO, defined as Treatment, Payment and Healthcare Operations.<br /><br />However, patients do have rights.  It makes sense because it’s their private information that’s at risk.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.officesafe.com/join.html">http://www.officesafe.com/join.html</a>{% endraw %}
