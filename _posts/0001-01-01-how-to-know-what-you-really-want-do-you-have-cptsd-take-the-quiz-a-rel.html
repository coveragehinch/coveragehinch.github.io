{% raw %}Do You Have CPTSD? Take The QUIZ: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3Eaq8Qb">https://bit.ly/3Eaq8Qb</a><br />***<br />How do you know when something is RIGHT for you? If you were traumatized as a child you may have lost the ability to sense &quot;rightness&quot; -- a true fit with someone you love, a job or decision. It's hard to know when a choice is your hearts desire, and when you are motivated by someone else's agenda, or a need for security. When this happens, you can end up with a life that feels wrong and is full of regret, and thatâ€™s exactly what happened to a woman whose letter I'm answering in this video. We talk about the one she lost, her fierce regrets, and what she can do to discover the life that will truly make her happy.<br />***<br />Take my #1 Online Course: <br />HEALING CHILDHOOD PTSD<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/39NxUBo">http://bit.ly/39NxUBo</a><br /><br />BECOME A MEMBER<br />Get Access to ALL MY COURSES in my Membership Program.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2rukHvh">http://bit.ly/2rukHvh</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE to Help Calm CPTSD Symptoms:<br />The DAILY PRACTICE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3608opl">http://bit.ly/3608opl</a><br /><br />ARE YOU DYSREGULATED? <br />Take the QUIZ<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/38c71Wm">http://bit.ly/38c71Wm</a><br /><br />Or take the course:<br />DYSREGULATION BOOTCAMP<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3t5vPtN">https://bit.ly/3t5vPtN</a><br /><br />Heal Isolation and Loneliness:<br />The CONNECTION BOOTCAMP<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3vCryih">https://bit.ly/3vCryih</a><br /><br />NEED ONLINE THERAPY?<br />If you're seeking therapy, BetterHelp can connect you with a licensed, online therapist, please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://betterhelp.com/CCF">https://betterhelp.com/CCF</a><br />I receive commissions on referrals &amp; recommend services I know and trust.<br /><br />COACHING/WEBSITE/COURSES<br />Find links to Crappy Childhood Fairy programs here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3pdhF7t">https://bit.ly/3pdhF7t</a><br />***{% endraw %}
