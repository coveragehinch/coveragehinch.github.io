{% raw %}What is Bearing? Types of Bearings and How they Work?<br /><br />Generally, all types of machinery are provided with supports for rotating shafts, the supporting device is known as a bearing. In other words, a bearing is a machine element that constrains relative motions and is used to reduce the friction between moving parts.<br /><br />Bearing employs to support, guide, and restrain moving the element. This is a stationary member and it carries the load.<br /><br />The common applications of bearings are:<br />Shafting in workshops,<br />Spindles of a machine tool such as a lathe, drilling, milling machine, etc.<br />The crankshaft of engines, and axles of automobiles, etc.<br /><br />Types of Bearings<br />Following are the different types of bearings:<br />1) Rolling Element Bearing<br />2) Plain Bearing<br />3) Fluid Bearing<br />4) Magnetic Bearing<br />5) Jewel Bearing<br />6) Flexure Bearing<br /><br />---- Time Stamps ---<br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:44 - Types of Bearings<br />00:57 - What is the Purpose of Bearings?<br />01:30 - Rolling Element Bearing<br />02:10 - Ball Bearing<br />02:51 - Types of Ball Bearings<br />04:11 - Roller Bearing<br />04:46 - Types of Roller Bearings<br />06:14 - Plain Bearing<br />06:54 - Fluid Bearing<br />07:26 - Magnetic Bearing<br />07:56 - Jewel Bearing<br />08:31 - Flexure Bearing<br />09:16 - Wrap Up<br /><br />Watch our recent video on Machine Tools: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KR8v633uQ_M">https://youtu.be/KR8v633uQ_M</a><br /><br />Watch More on Bearings:<br />How to Properly Handle Bearings to Prevent failure: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Aj2I-QxrOjw">https://youtu.be/Aj2I-QxrOjw</a><br />Mounting and dismounting of SKF Deep groove bearing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/n9zWjmodm8k">https://youtu.be/n9zWjmodm8k</a><br />Mounting and dismounting of SKF Angular contact ball bearings: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/MUxFTobPsw8">https://youtu.be/MUxFTobPsw8</a><br />Frictionless long life flexure bearings by CTEC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DegNvMM2MJs">https://youtu.be/DegNvMM2MJs</a><br />Watch Jewels Explained - Demonstration with 17 Jewels Timor Movement: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/lKJmF3AuNu0">https://youtu.be/lKJmF3AuNu0</a><br /><br />Download the PDF:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theengineerspost.com/types-of-bearing/">https://www.theengineerspost.com/types-of-bearing/</a><br /><br />Follow us Facebook:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/fanpageengineerspost">https://www.facebook.com/fanpageengineerspost</a><br /><br />Visit our Website for more articles:-<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theengineerspost.com/">https://www.theengineerspost.com/</a><br /><br />Like this video If you find it useful share it with your friends, and If you have any questions leave a comment weâ€™ll respond.<br /><br />Thanks for watching and subscribe for more.{% endraw %}
