{% raw %}Abstract: Hitchin’s equations are a system of gauge theoretic equations on a Riemann surface that are of interest in many areas including representation theory, Teichmu ̈ller theory, and the geometric Langlands correspondence. In this talk, I’ll describe what solutions of SL(n, C)-Hitchin’s equations “near the ends” of the moduli space look like, and the resulting compactification of the Hitchin moduli space. Wild Hitchin moduli spaces are an important ingredient in this construction. This construction generalizes Mazzeo-Swoboda-Weiss-Witt’s construction of SL(2, C)-solutions of Hitchin’s equations where the Higgs field is “simple.”<br /><br />Recording during the meeting &quot;Gauge Theory and Complex Geometry&quot; the June 20, 2018 at the Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques (Marseille, France)<br /><br />Filmmaker: Guillaume Hennenfent<br /><br />Find this video and other talks given by worldwide mathematicians on CIRM's Audiovisual Mathematics Library: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://library.cirm-math.fr.">http://library.cirm-math.fr.</a> And discover all its functionalities: <br />- Chapter markers and keywords to watch the parts of your choice in the video<br />- Videos enriched with abstracts, bibliographies, Mathematics Subject Classification<br />- Multi-criteria search by author, title, tags, mathematical area{% endraw %}
