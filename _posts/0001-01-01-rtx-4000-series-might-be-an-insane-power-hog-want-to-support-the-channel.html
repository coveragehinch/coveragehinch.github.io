It’s been a while since we heard ANYTHING About their GPU lineup thanks to alder lake completely taking over the news. Well, this changes today, because we got some news on their next generation of GPU’s. Heck this will likely also be true for the Future AMD gpu’s too.<br />So, this comes from 2 leakers over on twitter, Kopite 7 kimi and greymon 55. First, came the Pinned tweet last week from Kopite saying “ Rest in peace PSU, I dont want to leak details now, let’s wait and see. <br /><br />Now, if we go by what the current rumors are, its clear he was talking about GPUs. I mean, both Nvidia and AMD are expected to greatly increase the TDP of their Highest end GPUs for the next generation. AMD’s  rx 7000 series, would allegedly be sub 500W, while Nvidia’s 4000 series would top out around 420 to 450W. Well, It looks like the rumors were a little gun shy. Apparently, the RTX 4090 will have a TGPs of no less than 550W. <br /><br />————————————————<br />———————————————— <br />About Boot Sequence:<br />Snows and the rest of the Boot Sequence team are here to bring you the latest breaking Tech News.
