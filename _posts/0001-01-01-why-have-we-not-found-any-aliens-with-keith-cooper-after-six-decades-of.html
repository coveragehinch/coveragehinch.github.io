{% raw %}After six decades of examining signals from space, why have we yet to discover evidence of extra-terrestrial life?<br />Keith's book &quot;The Contact Paradox: Challenging our Assumptions in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&quot; is available now - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/JFpy">https://geni.us/JFpy</a><br /><br />For the past six decades a small cadre of researchers have been on a quest, as part of SETI, to search for extraterrestrial intelligence. So far, SETI has found no evidence of extraterrestrial life, but with more than a hundred billion stars in our Galaxy alone to search, the odds of quick success are stacked against us.<br /><br />Keith Cooper explores how far SETI has come since its modest beginnings, where it's going and the assumptions that we make in our search for extraterrestrial life.<br /><br />Watch the Q&amp;A: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_qEjTXrQ7vs">https://youtu.be/_qEjTXrQ7vs</a><br /><br />Keith Cooper is a freelance science journalist and editor.
