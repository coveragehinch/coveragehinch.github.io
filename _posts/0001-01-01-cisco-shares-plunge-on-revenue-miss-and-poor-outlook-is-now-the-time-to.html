{% raw %}Jim Lebenthal joins the 'Halftime Report' with his outlook on Cisco, a company whose shares are plunging today following reports of supply chain issues.

Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected 82 cents per share in adjusted earnings on $12.85 billion in revenue, which implies 7.4% growth.<br /><br />For the full fiscal year, Cisco’s forecast was $3.38 to $3.45 in adjusted earnings per share and 5% to 7% revenue growth. Analysts polled by Refinitiv were looking for earnings of $3.42 per share and $52.87 billion in revenue, which would equal 6.1% growth.<br /><br />Revenue rose 8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the company said in a statement. Net income, at $3 billion, grew 37%.<br /><br />The company faced supply constraints, CEO Chuck Robbins said on a conference call with analysts.<br /><br />“We’ve been taking multiple steps to mitigate the supply shortages and deliver products to our customers, including working closely with our key suppliers and contract manufacturers, paying significantly higher logistics costs to get the components where they are most needed, working on modifying our designs to utilize alternative suppliers where possible and constantly optimizing our build and delivery plans,” Robbins said.<br /><br />That work and cost increases from suppliers are together pressuring Cisco’s gross margin, Robbins said.<br /><br />“While we thoughtfully raise prices to offset this impact, the benefits are not immediate and will be recognized over the coming quarters,” he said. Meanwhile, customers are frustrated with lead times for receiving products, Robbins said.<br /><br />Supply challenges are weighing on quarterly guidance, and price increases will boost results in the third and fourth quarters, said Scott Herren, Cisco’s finance chief.<br /><br />Cisco announced new product categories for reporting revenue during the period and is now highlighting some smaller parts of the business, such as Optimized Application Experiences. The largest category under the new structure, Secure, Agile Networks, which includes data center networking switches, produced $5.97 billion in revenue, up 10%.<br /><br />The Internet for the Future category, comprising routed optical networking, public 5G, silicon and optics products, generated $1.37 billion in revenue, up 46%. And revenue in the Hybrid Work category, including Webex collaboration products, fell 7% to $1.11 billion.<br /><br />During the quarter Cisco showed a preview of Webex Hologram, a new way to hold meetings in augmented reality with holograms of meeting participants.<br /><br />Excluding the after-hours move, Cisco shares are up about 28% this year, while the S&amp;P 500 index is up 25% over the same period.<br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a> <br /><br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
