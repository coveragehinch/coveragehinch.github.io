{% raw %}Penfed Federal Credit Union is a good bank that give credit to people with not so great credit. I got a 20k personal loan with Penfed and I had fair credit with a score of 663 at the time. In this video I'm going to talk how I got it and how I prepared my credit report to get it. There are also ways to get loan with soft pulls to even penfed at first just do a soft pull but actually getting it they do a hard pull. You even get loans if you had bad credit but you need to work extra hard and get a few secured loans.<br /><br />#unsecuredloan #penfed #personalloan #20kloan <br /><br />Soft Pull Loan<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lendingtree.com">https://www.lendingtree.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.avant.com">https://www.avant.com</a><br /><br />Follow IG:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/leveluphighertv/">https://www.instagram.com/leveluphighertv/</a><br />intro 0:00<br />my score/where they pull from 0:25<br />0:44 how to apply and my experience<br />how to prepare your credit to get unsecured loan 1:33 <br />soft pull personal loans 2:57<br />control the debt not the other way around 4:59{% endraw %}
