{% raw %}NOTE FROM TED: This talk only represents the speaker's personal views and understanding of trauma and epigenetics. We've flagged this talk because it falls outside the content guidelines TED gives TEDx organizers. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf">http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf</a><br /><br />Uncover the impact that American history has had on our national mental health. A social worker who has struggled with anxiety and addiction shares where his personal experience and research converged. It is not our trauma, but it is our responsibility to heal. Over the past 10 years, Thomas has held a variety of positions working directly with youth and families involved in the child welfare system. Upon recognizing a pattern of abuse and neglect in families showing high levels of generational trauma, Thomas began work creating and implementing a team of caseworkers focused on healing these wounds and preventing further familial involvement in the system. A recipient of the Child Welfare Stipend, he graduated with honors from MSU’s Master of Social Work program in 2020. He continues to lead his team in one of Colorado’s largest county Human Services Departments. Thomas’ work sheds light on the diagnostic implications that misidentified trauma can have on individuals and how the collective mental health of America is being impacted by a national history laden with adversity. He hopes to bring a more compassionate, trauma-informed, approach to the way we diagnose and treat behavioral health and mental illness in America. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
