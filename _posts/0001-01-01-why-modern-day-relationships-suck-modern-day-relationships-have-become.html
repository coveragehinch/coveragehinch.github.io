{% raw %}Modern day relationships have become one of the most frustrating and complicated parts of our lives. From what I’ve noticed this is attributed to a whole bunch of different reasons but the main ones I found out to be the most prevalent in our generation:<br />00:00 — Defining Modern Day Relationships<br />00:38 — Hookup Culture<br />02:37 — People underestimate how much work relationships are<br />03:47 — People are looking for their own personal gain before getting into a relationship AKA Selfishness<br />04:44 - Poor Communication; people would rather rant about the problem they’re having with their significant other with their family and friends rather than confronting the actual person they’re having a problem with<br />06:07 - “Perfect” Social Media Couples that show you the best parts of their lives causing others to compare their current relationship state with their “perfect moments”<br /><br />At the end of the day a successful long term relationship will come down to 4 C’s:<br />1) Communication<br />2) Compromise<br />3) Companionship<br />4) Compassion<br /><br />That is all for this #FaisalFridays (I know I’m uploading this video on a Sunday but that’s because I have commitment issues OK)<br /><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/faisalalshaka">https://instagram.com/faisalalshaka</a>{% endraw %}
