{% raw %}BUY, LEASE OR FINANCE A FORD MUSTANG MACH-E FROM OSV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3CiUn73">https://bit.ly/3CiUn73</a> <br /><br />Electric cars are often rather dull. But this one, Ford's Mustang Mach-E, very definitely isn't. The use of that famous name - and the styling cues that go with it - has certainly divided opinion, but it's also inspired the Blue Oval brand to give this family-sized sporting SUV a charisma its obvious rival lack. Plus if you go for the larger 'Extended Range' battery option, you'll get yourself an EV offering a very decent all-electric driving range too. It all sounds quite promising.<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br />00:00​​​​ Introduction<br />00:46 Background<br />03:33 Driving Experience<br />13:15 Design &amp; Build<br />28:14 Market &amp; Model Range<br />42:32 Cost of Ownership<br />54:12 Summary<br /><br />Background<br /><br />It's difficult to think of a much less environmentally-friendly automotive model line than that of the Ford Mustang. Yet this is the nameplate Ford has chosen for the all-electric cars it will make in the coming era, this being the first of them, the Mustang Mach-E. This sporting SUV model is, we're told, about fast, fun freedom and it aims to please a whole new generation of Mustang owners.<br /><br />The 'Mach' name was apparently inspired by the 'Mach 1' variant of the first generation Mustang and fits with the remit given to the car's creators, Ford's 'Team Edison', who were tasked with creating 'an EV with soul'. Is that what we've got here? You might wonder. After all, this model's supposedly all-new 'GE1' ('Global Electrified 1') platform is actually a revised version of the C2 chassis used in the brand's current Focus and Kuga models. But the product itself couldn't be more different from those conventional cars. As we're about to find out.<br /><br />Driving Experience<br /><br />There's a bit more bite to the drive dynamics than is common in this class, with well-bridled body control and keen grip through the turns. The Mach-E has three driving modes, rather cringily named 'Whisper', 'Active' and 'Untamed'. All versions have a top speed limited to 111mph. And there's a single toggle switch for regenerative braking called 'One-Pedal Mode'. The line-up kicks off with two rear-driven models, one using the 'Standard Range' 68kWh battery, which puts out 269PS and can take you up to 273 miles. The other uses an 'Extended Range' 88kWh battery pack, which ups power to 294PS and increases the car's potential driving distance between charges to 379 miles in rear-driven form.<br /><br />There are also various all-wheel drive versions, which feature an electric motor at each end of the car, with torque applied independently to each axle. An AWD Mustang Mach-E with the base 68kWh battery has a 248 mile range, but ideally you'd want to stretch to the 'Extended Range' four-wheel-drive version, which puts out 351PS, 565Nm of torque, will get you to 62mph in 6.2 seconds and has a 336 mile WLTP range. If you want more, there's a performance-orientated Mustang Mach-E GT model, which uses the larger battery and AWD, puts out 487PS and 830Nm of torque and makes 62mph from rest in just 4.1 seconds. That top version goes 310 miles between charges and comes with MagneRide adaptive damping. As with most EVs of this size, kerb weight is substantial, in this case between 1,993 and 2,218kgs depending on variant.<br /><br />Design and Build<br /><br />In terms of size, this Mexican-built model is 4,712mm long, 1,881mm wide and 1,597mm high, which places it size-wise somewhere between a Jaguar I-PACE and a Mercedes EQC. Clever styling tricks mean it doesn't actually look that big on first acquaintance, but it is immediately recognisable as a Mustang, thanks to signature elements like its long, powerful bonnet, distinctive rear haunches, aggressive headlights and trademark tri-bar tail lamps. Neat design and engineering deliver surprising rear seat roominess and ample cargo space. There are no conventional door handles: just buttons that pop open the doors. It's possible to use your smartphone as an entry key: or you can use a keypad built into the B-pillar.<br /><br />**CAR REVIEW PLAYLISTS**<br />► New Car Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3myaZiV">https://bit.ly/3myaZiV</a> <br />► Behind the Wheel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35JuUo7">https://bit.ly/35JuUo7</a> <br />► Highlight Car Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35N1Wnx">https://bit.ly/35N1Wnx</a> <br />► Electric Car Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2TAqjPK">https://bit.ly/2TAqjPK</a> <br />► Short Car Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2HHlJMS">https://bit.ly/2HHlJMS</a> <br />► Hatchback Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3mKNAen">https://bit.ly/3mKNAen</a> <br />► SUV &amp; 4X4 Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/37Verjt">https://bit.ly/37Verjt</a> <br />► Saloon Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/37QrbrD">https://bit.ly/37QrbrD</a> <br />► City Car Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jDzBVI">https://bit.ly/3jDzBVI</a> <br />► Estate Car Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3kDflog">https://bit.ly/3kDflog</a> <br />► Sports Car and Coupe Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2TwkzXb">https://bit.ly/2TwkzXb</a> <br />► MPV Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3e7114S">https://bit.ly/3e7114S</a> <br />► Van Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/31QWcb4">https://bit.ly/31QWcb4</a> <br />► Business Car Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3kGZncN">https://bit.ly/3kGZncN</a> <br />► Family Car Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3myLaiy">https://bit.ly/3myLaiy</a> <br /><br />**FOLLOW OSV ON**<br />► Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/OSVLtd/">https://www.facebook.com/OSVLtd/</a><br />► Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/osvmotoringnews">https://twitter.com/osvmotoringnews</a><br />► Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/osvltd/">https://www.instagram.com/osvltd/</a><br /><br />#FordMustangMachE #MustangMachE #CarReview{% endraw %}
