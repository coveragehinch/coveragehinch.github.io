{% raw %}I regret losing certain women but it was always my fault StoryVoices Jazz for Study<br />Welcome to my channel!<br />STORYVOICES - a new start-up company that provides high quality music on the internet. Our first product is a service that allows you to listen to any song or playlist on demand and download it for free! We have also created an application for iOS, Android and Windows Phone that lets you enjoy your favorite songs offline without connecting to the Internet. The main goal of our project is to provide users with access to all popular music at all times, not only when there's WiFi nearby.<br />0:00 Ere we permit a Foreign Foe<br />2:37 For a person to think<br />5:33 For fear the desolation<br />8:21 Far from this Grackle we shall flee<br />11:15 En my heart des cry ter be<br />14:10 Every kiss thou dost inspire<br />16:55 Ere strown by those autumnal eves<br />19:45 et quae res nobis uigilantibus obuia mentis<br />22:34 est procul a nobis infelix gloria Sullae<br />25:29 Expounding and illustrating the riddle<br />28:25 Enough for all the divers shapes of those<br />31:09 For a person to think<br />34:04 fairy glade in Sherwood begins to be visible in the gloom<br />36:46 Fashions the object of desire<br />39:30 Ere the last light that leaps the night has hung and shone and<br />42:08 Fair as a garden of the Lord<br />44:47 Ere a boy was born in magic<br />46:57 Ere the last light that leaps the night has hung and shone and<br />49:35 Enough for all the divers shapes of those<br />52:18 Et variae volucres nemora avia pervolitantes<br />54:53 ewes that stand waiting to be milked in the yards of some rich<br />57:43 Feeling the infinite must be<br />1:00:23 First must the spirit cast aside<br />1:03:07 Feeble spirits only vaunt<br />1:06:03 Eyes should look into eyes to supplement<br />1:08:50 Faster than the cross of battle<br />1:11:37 Endure with patience the distasteful fun<br />1:14:27 For ever we see fierce Want and foul Disgrace<br />1:17:16 Ensamples still of things exclusively<br />1:19:55 For kings are children of the skies<br />1:22:44 Felt that same kinship of the human heart<br />1:25:25 For kings are children of the skies<br />1:28:15 Facing in the wide fire flaming circle<br />1:31:12 Encircled by innumerable bands<br />1:33:54 Even from the pleasant sound of his dear land<br />1:36:32 Even from the pleasant sound of his dear land<br />1:39:10 Fashions the object of desire<br />1:41:55 Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown<br />All rights belong to our team.<br />Please do not re-upload<br />Please subscribe to our channel for more videos!<br />#STORYVOICES #STORYVOICESpianopiano #STORYVOICESrainypiano #StoryVoicespiano #StoryVoicespianoMusic{% endraw %}
