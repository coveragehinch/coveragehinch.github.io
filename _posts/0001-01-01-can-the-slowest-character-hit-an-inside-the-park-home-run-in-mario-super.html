It builds on the social-gaming fun and movements people learned in Wii Sports and turns them into a full-fledged baseball game that can be played by every member of the household. Players make a throwing motion with the Wii Remote controller to pitch the baseball and make a swinging motion to swing at the pitch. The game boasts more than 30 playable Nintendo characters and all the madness of a Mario sports game. Just like Mario Kart Wii, it bridges the gap between experienced players and those new to the Wii console, with fun challenges and beautiful graphics.<br /><br />Let the Wii Remote controller be your bat as you join Mario, Luigi, Peach, and the rest of the gang in a rocking, socking baseball extravaganza.<br /><br />Newcomers to gaming or sports titles will be up and running on Mario Super Sluggers in no time. Simply swing the Wii Remote to smack a home run, or use a pitching motion to toss the ball over the plate. Two, three or four players can pick up Wii Remote controllers and challenge one another to a full baseball game or compete in a host of baseball-themed mini-games. There's even a home run hitting contest. Mario Super Sluggers boasts more than 40 playable characters, all Nintendo favorites. The single-player adventure mode allows the player to explore Baseball Kingdom, tackle dozens of fun baseball challenges and unlock new characters that can be used in any mode. You can also play with your Mii characters in Exhibition, Toy Field and Minigame modes.<br /><br />ðŸ”µ MY LINKS:<br />TikTok:<br />â€¢<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tiktok.com/@AaronChiz">http://tiktok.com/@AaronChiz</a><br /><br />Twitter:<br />â€¢<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/ChizPlays">http://twitter.com/ChizPlays</a><br /><br />Instagram:<br />â€¢<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/ChizPlays">http://instagram.com/ChizPlays</a><br /><br />ðŸ”µ GAME:<br />Name: Mario Super Sluggers<br />Developer: Nintendo<br />Publisher: Nintendo<br />Platforms: Nintendo Wii<br /><br />#mariosupersluggers #nintendo #chizplays #retro{% endraw %}
