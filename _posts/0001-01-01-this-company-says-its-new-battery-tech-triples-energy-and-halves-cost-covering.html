Tesla Partner CATL Just Introduced A FIRST GEN HYPER EFFICIENT Sodium-Ion Battery!!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3hVX9Agz0xI">https://youtu.be/3hVX9Agz0xI</a><br /><br />Our story starts in California, where a new battery startup called OneD Battery Sciences is building a production facility in Moses Lake in Washington State. <br /><br />As far as battery startups go, this isn't strange. After all, if you're going to sell batteries, you're going to have to build them, right? <br /><br />The only difference between OneD and any other battery Startup is that OneD is making pretty audacious claims. Its new facility in Washington State is where the company claims it will continue perfecting its new battery building technology called SINANODE. <br /><br />So, what's SINANODE? According to OneD, it's a breakthrough technology that will power the next generation of EV batteries. That's a brave claim, right? Well, it appears that OneD has, at least in theory, the tech backing up that brave claim. <br /><br />When creating SINANODE, the company set out to create a battery with more silicon. Batteries with more silicon generally last longer than batteries without. The reason is simple; Silicon is a highly desirable anode material as it has over ten times the energy density of current graphite anodes. <br /><br />Do you see why a lot of companies have set out to build a working battery with silicon? Sadly, the material's tendency to expand when used in batteries has been a gigantic stumbling block to many companies trying to build a silicone-based battery. <br /><br />For a long time, this tendency has held back commercial production of silicon-based batteries. But it now appears that OneD has broken the code, and is now free to exclaim Eureka! Or Tesla! As the case might be. <br /><br />This new battery tech by OneD Is not a kind of battery ‚Äî instead, it's a manufacturing process. Yes, we might just be splitting hairs here, since the technique will lead to a new battery, but it's important to get these terms right. <br /><br />At the core of this process are silicon nanowires that are fused directly onto graphite powder in the anode.<br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />ü§© The Tesla Domain is the Number 1 channel to go when you want to be up to date with the latest Tesla news, rumors, and insights.
