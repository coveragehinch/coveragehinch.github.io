{% raw %}Once in a lifetime Lyrics by Freestyle<br /><br />LEAVE A COMMENT, LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE<br />THANK YOU ‚ù§ GODBLESS YOU üòäüòäüòç<br /><br />üéôLYRICS<br /><br />Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby<br />And I don't know what to do<br />All I think about is you<br />Seems everything around me<br />Things I've never understood<br />They all make sense when I'm with you<br /><br />Oh, I've heard it all before<br />Finding so called love then you leave it behind<br />But now I feel so sure<br />I listen to my heart this time<br />So I lay it on the line<br /><br />I know that what I've found<br />Is once in a lifetime<br />And I know there's no way out<br />'Coz it's once in a lifetime<br /><br />I've always been so lonely<br />No one there for me to hold<br />And every night was just so cold<br />Oh, don't get me wrong I've been around<br />But I've resigned myself to thinking<br />Mine is just another story often told<br /><br />Oh, I've heard it all before<br />Finding so called love then you leave it behind<br />But now I feel so sure<br />I listen to my heart this time<br />Put my heart before my mind<br /><br />I know that what I've found<br />Is once in a lifetime<br />And I know there's no way out<br />'Coz it's once in a lifetime...<br /><br />It's not like I'm runnin' out of time<br />I'm takin' everything in stride<br />It's just I never thought I'd find<br />What would make me change my mind<br /><br />I know that what I've found<br />Is once in a lifetime<br />Yeah, and I know there's no way out<br />'Coz it's once in a lifetime<br /><br />Ohh... ohhh...<br />Ohh... ohhh...{% endraw %}
