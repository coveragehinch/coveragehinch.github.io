A Canadian who has been living in Germany since 2014. 🇩🇪 <br /><br />Like many, I had a difficult time relocating - all the paperwork, making sure I wasn’t getting scammed, finding a flat, a phone plan, a job, etc. So, I took it slowly and documented all my adventures along the way so that years down the road, I could help others avoid making the same mistakes I did. Let’s look at it as… PAVING THE WAY FOR NEW EXPATS TO SAVE TIME &amp; MONEY! <br /><br />I built up www.lifeinduesseldorf.com to help expats make the best out of their lives in Düsseldorf, and then soon realized a lot of the content I was sharing was helpful for ALL expats living in Germany. SO I BUILT AN ONLINE PROGRAM THAT HELPS EXPATS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD RELOCATE TO GERMANY EASILY - WHILE ALSO HELPING TO SAVE THEM THOUSANDS OF EUROS! 🤑<br />... and now I’m bringing it all to YOUTUBE! ♥️<br /><br />For more tips &amp; expat stories, don’t forget to [SUBSCRIBE]: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/life-in-germany">https://bit.ly/life-in-germany</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Links included in my descriptions are sometimes affiliate links.
