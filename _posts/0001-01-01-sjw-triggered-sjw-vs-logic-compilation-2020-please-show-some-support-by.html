It's been a while.<br /><br />Since the apocalypse, just like any other person, I had to work outside of YouTube.  This channel is still demonetized and there's nothing much I can do about it. I hope you guys understand.<br /><br />But yes, I'm back. Thank you for sticking around. I love you all.<br />----------------------<br /><br />Social Justice Warrior is a pejorative label applied to bloggers, activists, and commentators who are prone to engage in lengthy and hostile debates against others on a range of issues concerning social injustice, identity politics, and political correctness. In contrast to the social justice blogosphere at large, the stereotype of a social justice warrior is distinguished by the use of overzealous and self-righteous rhetorics, as well as appealing to emotions over logic and reason.{% endraw %}
