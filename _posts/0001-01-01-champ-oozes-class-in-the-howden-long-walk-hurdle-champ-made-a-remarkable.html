{% raw %}Champ made a remarkable return to the smaller obstacles to win the Grade One Howden Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot.<br /><br />The nine-year-old, trained by Nicky Henderson, was last seen being pulled up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup – but showed he retained all his ability when outpointing Thyme Hill and Paisley Park in the extended three-mile showpiece.<br /><br />The 4-1 chance was pulling double before the home turn with two flights left to jump and had to find extra in the closing stages as Thyme Hill put in a serious challenge.<br /><br />But Jonjo O’Neill Jnr – recording a landmark first Grade One victory of his career – kept the JP McManus-owned gelding up to his work to prevail by a length and three-quarters.<br /><br />Thyme Hill was runner-up for the second year running, although he reversed placings from 2020 with Paisley Park, who was three and a half lengths away in third on this occasion. Thomas Darby was fourth.<br /><br />It was a bittersweet success for Henderson as he had to withdraw ante-post favourite Buzz on the eve of the race as the horse suffered a serious injury.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Enjoy the best of Sky Sports Racing on the free and award-winning At The Races app: <br />iPhone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://apple.co/1I4NxAV">http://apple.co/1I4NxAV</a>  <br />Android: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1VPIcEz">http://bit.ly/1VPIcEz</a>  <br /><br />facebook.com/AtTheRaces<br />twitter.com/AtTheRaces<br />instagram.com/at.the.races{% endraw %}
