{% raw %}#upperbody #fitnesskaykay<br /><br />Hey Team #everydaywarrior,<br />get ready for a NEW super sweaty Upper Body Focused Workout - with Dumbbells (I was using 2x 5 kg for your reference).<br />Let’s target our entire Upper Body, as always Core is also involved so make sure to engage it the whole time. We also hit some conditioning moves with Weights in between. 💦<br /><br />For some of the exercises I used the momentum - so I did them faster, don't get irritated - follow your own tempo. For example with the Kneeling Clean Press I needed some extra Tension - that's why I pushed them faster. You can also do them a lot slower and really controlled. <br />Either Way works for the Muscle Tension. 🤗💪🏼<br /><br />P.S.: I decided to skip  the finisher.. (spontaneously). Maybe you know what this means.🤓<br />So, make sure to make this one as intense as it's supposed to be. 🔥<br /><br />Choose your weights wisely - feel free to switch in between.<br /><br />WIN YOUR DAY!💥💦<br /><br />w o r k o u t - d e t a i l s:<br />00:00 - 00:07 Intro<br />00:07 - 04:15 Warm Up<br />04:15 - 38:12 Workout (45 sec ON 🔥, 15 sec rest)<br />38:12 - 43:41 Cooldown <br /><br />Remember: we all are different, so are our levels of fitness. Make every single workout YOUR OWN. Also make sure to maintain a proper form while exercising. Feel free to rest some more if you need to. 🙏🏼<br /><br />Equipment: <br />*a pair of Dumbbells (I am using 2x 5 kg)<br />* a mat is recommended<br /><br />❤️ Join our official private Facebook Group: Fitness__KayKay #everydaywarrior: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3iRMAop">https://bit.ly/3iRMAop</a><br /><br />👉🏼 my supplements: foodspring, get 15 % off = kaykayFSG <br />👉🏼 favorite Pre Workout Drink: Energy Aminos Maracuja - find all my supplements:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/33zP0At">https://bit.ly/33zP0At</a><br />👉🏼 my daily Pre-Bed Recovery Tool = NatureCan CBD Oil: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3AswlVB">https://bit.ly/3AswlVB</a><br />10% off = kaykay<br /><br />*Gym Equipment (Dumbbells): Kingsbox Germany: kaykay5 = 5% off<br />*subscribe my channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3oCte8s">https://bit.ly/3oCte8s</a><br />*contact (business inquiries): kathrin@fyndafit.com<br />*Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3i0eKwp">https://bit.ly/3i0eKwp</a><br />*music, Epidemic  Sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/33tkQiv">https://bit.ly/33tkQiv</a><br /><br />Yours KayKay <br />xx<br /><br />D i s c l a i m e r: <br />This channel is for improvment of our fitness and health.💪🏼 Make sure to check your health with a professional medic before start exercising to avoid injury or harm.You are performing the fitness exercises without supervision, so you are performing on your own risk.
