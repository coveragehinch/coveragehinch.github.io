What should I eat everyday?<br />_____________________________________<br />Reasons Why You Need To Eat Fruit:<br />Fresh fruits are a great option for breakfast, snack or dessert. Most fruits are sweet and ready for you to eat without cooking or preparing a recipe. Take an apple, a peach, or a banana and just enjoy. Remember to always have fresh fruit available at home. If you have good choices available, you will make good choices.<br /><br />Children are now eating highly processed snacks that are nutritionally poor and a threat to their future health.  These products are loaded with artificial colors, flavors, refined sugars and are super high in calories. Kids are eating more refined sugars than ever before. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s statistics are alarming. By 2050, 1 in 3 people will have diabetes. You can improve and change that by switching many of these unhealthy snack options for fruit and homemade recipes.<br /><br />Eating more fresh fruit will help you stay away from processed food. Fruit comes from nature not a factory. The closer to nature, the better for your health. Fruits are naturally low in fat, calories, and have key nutrients that your child needs to grow. Fruit helps protect you from illnesses. If all of that isn’t enough to convince you, keep reading for the top 10 health benefits of eating it every day.<br /><br /><br />Eating fruit every day lowers the risk of so many diseases, it’s hard to list them all! For starters, a 2003 study found that eating fruit (and veggies) lowers your risk of developing heart disease. Since heart disease is the #1 killer in the US, that’s definitely a major benefit that helps us all. In 2003, the Harvard School of Public Health also found that eating whole fruits may help lower the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes.<br /><br /><br />As part of an overall healthy diet, fruit can really help make your bones and muscles stronger. A 2011 Florida State University study found that eating dried plums in particular can help prevent osteoporosis. Avocados are also fantastic for strong bones. Another study done by University of East Anglia just this year found that vitamin C can help you retain muscle mass. I don’t think I have to remind you that fruits are just loaded with C!<br /><br /><br />Certain fruits are super high in water content, which helps keep your whole body hydrated. While straight and plain water is always best, eating more fruit can help you reach your daily requirement, especially if you’re just not a fan of the plain stuff.<br /><br />Watermelon is the obvious choice, as its name implies. Did you know that strawberries also have about 92% water content, though? Grapefruit and cantaloupe are also made up of about 90% water. Even apples are a good option, with about 86% water.<br /><br /><br />If you don’t know, free radicals are nasty little unstable atoms that make us age faster, damage our healthy cells, and even cause cancer. Antioxidants are substances that help fight them off. While all fruits have them to some degree, ripe fruits are especially loaded with antioxidants, according to this study.<br /><br /><br /><br />One of the greatest benefits of fruit is all the healthy fiber in them. According to the USDA, it helps reduce blood cholesterol levels. That, in turn, goes back to the first point- it lowers your risk of heart disease. Fiber is also super important for healthy bowels. It helps keep you “regular,” which can prevent issues like constipation, hemorrhoids, and diverticulitis.{% endraw %}
