{% raw %}How to Get Divorced  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://nolodivorce.com/CA/MADB.html">http://nolodivorce.com/CA/MADB.html</a>  Attorney Ed Sherman explains the divorce process, and reveals the difference between an easy divorce (uncontested) and a difficult divorce (contested). He then shows you how to get an easy divorce. Ed is the divorce expert attorney who founded Nolo Press, started the self-help law movement, and saved the public BILLIONS of dollars in legal fees with his divorce books and software. People who like Whole Foods (WFM) will especially like this video. Too bad Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore didn't have this information before they spent two years finalizing their divorce. Be sure to watch to the end for a surprise at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/1x44QBf57fc">http://youtu.be/1x44QBf57fc</a>{% endraw %}
