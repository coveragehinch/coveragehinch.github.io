{% raw %}If you've ever needed to control multiple computers from a single keyboard and mouse, Barrier is software worth checking out! <br /><br />Barrier is a software solution (a fork of Synergy) which replaces unsightly KVM switches, and is super neat! In this video, I'll install Barrier on four systems (running Pop!_OS, Windows 10, macOS, and GhostBSD), and run them all from the same keyboard and mouse!<br /><br />Music is by me! Background audio was recorded on Linux using the Bitwig Studio DAW.{% endraw %}
