Start with the focal point. It will make creation of your composition easier<br />2. Use rule of thirds. Place the focal point off-center to make the composition more dynamic and interesting <br />3. Create the guiding lines to emphasize the focal point<br />4. Let modeling paste dry completely. I would recommend to start next day <br />5. Wet the canvas to get smooth color transitions<br />6. Mix paints with unbleached white. It makes colors look less childish and more sophisticated<br />7. Use very soft flat synthetic brush to smooth the gradient <br />8. Apply gilding wax to highlight the relief of modeling paste<br />9. Make your signature as a part of the composition in order not to ruin it <br /><br />üêæ Follow Me <br /><br />üñ§ My Personal Accounts<br />FB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ru.indie">https://www.facebook.com/ru.indie</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/indie.ru/">https://www.instagram.com/indie.ru/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/IndieRu_art">https://twitter.com/IndieRu_art</a><br /><br />My Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.indieru.art">https://www.indieru.art</a><br /><br /><br />üíº My Business Accounts<br />FB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Artlanticdesignstudiogmbh">https://www.facebook.com/Artlanticdesignstudiogmbh</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/artlantic.design/">https://www.instagram.com/artlantic.design/</a><br /><br />Company Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artlantic.design">https://artlantic.design</a><br /><br />Some of the links here are affiliate links.
