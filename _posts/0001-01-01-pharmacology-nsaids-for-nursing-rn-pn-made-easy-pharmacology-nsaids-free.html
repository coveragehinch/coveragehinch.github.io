Since then I have created over 1,200 videos, only 20% which live on YouTube, and have helped over 100,000 nursing students pass their NCLEX, HESI, ATI, and Kaplan proctor exams. Thank you for the continued support and love as we strive to help LPN, LVN and RN students become licensed nurses! <br /><br /><br />Popular Playlists:<br /><br />Fluid &amp; Electrolytes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/39BSHXs">https://bit.ly/39BSHXs</a> <br />Hear Failure (CHF): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2u5zfDm">https://bit.ly/2u5zfDm</a><br />Myocardial Infarction (MI): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3bN9AAk">https://bit.ly/3bN9AAk</a><br />Addisonâ€™s vs. Cushing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2STvute">https://bit.ly/2STvute</a> <br />Diabetes Mellitus &amp; DKA vs HHNS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/37D8nbs">https://bit.ly/37D8nbs</a> <br />Cardiomyopathy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/38CwcSg">https://bit.ly/38CwcSg</a> <br />IV Fluids: Hypertonic, Hypotonic &amp; Isotonic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2P45BWx">https://bit.ly/2P45BWx</a> <br />SIADH vs Diabetes Insipidus: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2wq6Bhb">https://bit.ly/2wq6Bhb</a> <br /><br />Thank you for the support!
