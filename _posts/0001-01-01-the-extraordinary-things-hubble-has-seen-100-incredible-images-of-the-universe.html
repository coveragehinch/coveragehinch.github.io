{% raw %}Since it launched more than three decades ago, the data that the Hubble space telescope has collected has been used to write more than 18,000 peer-reviewed scientific publications, from planet formation to gigantic black holes. But it is Hubble's awe-inspiring images that have reinvigorated the public interest in astronomy. At the click of a button, anyone can gaze at distant parts of the universe and the wonders that it contains, without ever having to leave our planet. Not since the days of Galileo has a telescope revolutionised our understanding of the cosmos and so broadly piqued the curiosity of the human race. Hubble is our window into the unknown. <br /><br />Sit back, relax, enjoy the incredible music and allow your eyes to scan across some of the greatest images ever captured. This is just a tiny part of the universe we exist within. <br /><br />Music attribution -<br />Fortitude by Lance Conrad (Artlist)<br />Boundary by Kevin Graham (Artlist)<br />Last Planet by Roman P (Artlist)<br /><br />All Hubble Images can be found here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubblesite.org/resource-gallery/images">https://hubblesite.org/resource-gallery/images</a><br /><br />I'm on PATREON!
