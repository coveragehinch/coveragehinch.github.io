{% raw %}Hey everyone, today we’re going to rank all of Dead by Daylight’s cosmetic killers. These are all the killer characters that can only be used through cosmetics. They aren’t their own character with powers and abilities in game but are still supposed to represent someone or something different. These characters appear primarily in Legendary or Ultra Rare skins. Let’s get into it. <br /><br />Chapter 23 has been announced! It's Ringu, a licensed chapter releasing in March of 2022. For now we have no details.  <br /><br />Music used from YouTube Audio Library: The Emperor's Army - Jeremy Blake <br /><br />Hope you enjoy! <br /><br />Dead by Daylight Wiki (very helpful and a ton of cool stuff and secrets on there): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki">https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki</a><br /><br />Intro 0:00<br />#7 0:20<br />#6 1:03<br />#5 1:50<br />#4 2:28<br />#3 3:08<br />#2 3:47<br />#1 4:33<br />Bonus 5:23<br />Outro 5:50{% endraw %}
