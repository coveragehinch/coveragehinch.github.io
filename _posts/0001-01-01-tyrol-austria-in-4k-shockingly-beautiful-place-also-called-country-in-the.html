{% raw %}==== THE STORY ====<br />I stayed for a few days in Austria &quot;by accident&quot;. Literally, my car broke down in Austria in a middle of nowhere, and I used this time to look around and experience this beautiful Alpine region called Tyrol. I did not even realize that I am in Tyrol until I tried to pay with a credit card and one of the restaurant employees said &quot;we don't accept it many, you know it's Tyrol&quot;. So make sure you have some cash on you if you are visiting this area (especially in the mountains). <br />For several days I have been hiking around different trials and enjoyed some pure mountains, the rivers, animals and other wonders of the nature. Incredible views.  I will post another 2 short videos from Alps and then a longer one covering my entire journey which took several weeks. If you would like to see it, do not forget to subscribe. Thank you again for your support!<br /><br />==== THE LOCATION ====<br /><br />&quot;Gasthof Pension Aschlandhof&quot; <br />Address: Aschland 117, 6416 Obsteig, Austria<br /><br />No stores and no real civilization within around 40 minutes walking distance. Which is perfect but not when you need some food and your car is dead... Still managed to take a long walk to the store to get food for a couple of days. I have seen lamas, I have seen cows, I have seen ship and and other mountain creatures. So nice and calming to see animals. <br /><br /><br />==== MUSIC ====<br /><br />â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“<br />Fly away by Rexlambo <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/rexlambo">https://soundcloud.com/rexlambo</a><br />Creative Commons â€” Attribution 3.0 Unported â€” CC BY 3.0<br />Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/l-fly-away">http://bit.ly/l-fly-away</a><br />Music promoted by Audio Library <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wbO_JnJTo_Q">https://youtu.be/wbO_JnJTo_Q</a><br />â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“<br /><br />ðŸŽµ Track Info:<br /><br />Title: Fly away by Rexlambo<br />Genre and Mood: Dance &amp; Electronic + Calm<br /><br />â€”â€”â€”<br /><br />ðŸŽ§ Available on: <br /><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/3iAuXIc">https://spoti.fi/3iAuXIc</a><br />iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/3mhs6q1">https://apple.co/3mhs6q1</a><br />Deezer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://deezer.com/us/track/1040585722">https://deezer.com/us/track/1040585722</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Lr6sYgsA0_A">https://youtube.com/watch?v=Lr6sYgsA0_A</a><br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/rexlambo/rexla...">https://soundcloud.com/rexlambo/rexla...</a><br />Google Play: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35CGpQ6">https://bit.ly/35CGpQ6</a><br /><br />â€”â€”â€”<br /><br />ðŸ˜Š Contact the Artist:<br /><br />Rexlambo:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/rexlambo">https://soundcloud.com/rexlambo</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0I83J...">https://open.spotify.com/artist/0I83J...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rex...">https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rex...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCqBmRmta...">https://youtube.com/channel/UCqBmRmta...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://deezer.com/us/artist/82163692">https://deezer.com/us/artist/82163692</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/rexlambomusic">https://instagram.com/rexlambomusic</a>{% endraw %}
