{% raw %}Mostly just made this because I felt like it. People seem to really like music extensions, so I figured I may as well offer this to people (also to avoid the small possibility of someone else doing it &quot;for me&quot;).<br /><br />This took ages to render though. I was going to comment on how some people do this regularly, but it's probably because they're doing it with something more powerful than a laptop.<br /><br />...anyway, go play Polyrhythm Mania: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://polyrhythmmania.rhre.dev">https://polyrhythmmania.rhre.dev</a><br /><br /> ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ <br /><br />Music: Title A - Polyrhythm Mania<br />Arrangement: GENERIC (GenericArrangements)<br /><br />Polyrhythm Mania OST: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt_3dgnFrUPwcA6SdTfi0RapEBdQV64v_">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt_3dgnFrUPwcA6SdTfi0RapEBdQV64v_</a><br /><br />My Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GENERIC_wav">https://twitter.com/GENERIC_wav</a>{% endraw %}
