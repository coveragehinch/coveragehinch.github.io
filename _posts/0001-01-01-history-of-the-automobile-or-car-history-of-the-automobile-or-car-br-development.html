{% raw %}history of the automobile or car <br />Development started as early as the 17th century with the invention of the first steam powered vehicle, which led to the creation of the first steam-powered automobile capable of human transportation, built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot in 1769.<br />Inventors began to branch out at the start of the 19th century, creating the de Rivas engine, one of the first internal combustion engines and an early electric motor. Samuel Brown later tested the first industrially applied internal combustion engine in 1826. <br />Development was hindered in the mid-19th century by a backlash against large vehicles, yet progress continued on some internal combustion engines. The engine evolved as engineers created two and four cycle combustion engines and began using gasoline as fuel. Production vehicles began appearing in 1887, when Karl Benz developed a petrol or gasoline-powered automobile and made several identical copies. Recent automobile production is marked by the Ford Model T, created by the Ford Motor Company in 1908, which became the first automobile to be mass-produced on a moving assembly line{% endraw %}
