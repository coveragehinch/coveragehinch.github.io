For decades, the death of famed Hollywood actress Natalie Wood has remained a mystery. She washed up on shore one night after partying with husband Robert Wagner and friend Christopher Walken on a private yacht. Robert claimed that Natalie had gone off on his yacht’s dinghy alone with the intention of going party hopping. However, when Natalie’s body turned up, she was wearing what looked to be pajamas. Additionally, Natalie had a fear of the water due to a rather morbid prediction from a fortune-teller.<br /><br />▬Contents of this video▬<br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:43 - Body<br />07:37 - Outro<br /><br />Like this content?

Of course, Maria was more focused on the famous movie star part and subsequently groomed her daughter into superstardom. By the time younger sister Lana was born, Natalie was already a famous child star that could be seen in various films, including Miracle on 34th Street.<br /><br />In the years since Natalie Wood’s tragic death at the age of only 43, younger sister Lana has maintained that she believes her husband, Robert Wagner was responsible for her death. These claims got Lana blacklisted from the industry by none other than Robert himself. Recently, Lana has finished work on a book that presents her best case for why she believes Robert was her sister’s murder.<br /><br />In addition to details about Natalie’s death, Lana’s new book also reveals the identity of the man that Lana has long since claimed sexually assaulted her late older sister when the latter was only 16 years old.
