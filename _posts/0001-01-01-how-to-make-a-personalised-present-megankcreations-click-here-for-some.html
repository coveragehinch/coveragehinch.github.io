{% raw %}***CLICK HERE FOR SOME MORE COOL STUFF! ***<br /><br />My sisters 26th birthday was soon approaching and I really wanted to give her something I made which was personal to her - and this is what I came up with! :D I love personalised pressies because they hold so much meaning and the thought and effort put into it makes such a big difference :) I've written up a detailed blog post about how I made the box as well as what I decided to put in it and why so feel free to have a read if you like! What kind of box would YOU make for someone? Let me know, or even better - show me!<br /><br />HOW TO MAKE A PERSONALISED PRESENT!
