{% raw %}Axell Hodges backflip to wheelie over 75ft gap on a KX450.<br />Beverly Hills Aerials came out for the day to do some camera testing at the Slayground so i couldn't think of a better time to try this trick. Enjoy some cool drone footage ripping around the property. <br />In the second half of the video we head to Ironman Raceway to race a GNCC race. Was pouring the whole time and was an absolute mudder! <br />Thanks for watching!<br />SLAYCO96.com<br />SONG - NO CONTROL by PEPPER{% endraw %}
