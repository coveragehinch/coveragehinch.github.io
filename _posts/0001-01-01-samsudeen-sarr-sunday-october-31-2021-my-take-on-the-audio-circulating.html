{% raw %}Samsudeen Sarr, Sunday October 31, 2021. My take on the audio circulating worldwide spreading negative comments about President Adama Barrow on a &quot;massive land-deal&quot; with a Romanian ex-convict from one Baba Aidara, an overrated Senegalese reporter who in 2017 was given a special award by the president in New York city for his &quot;support that brought about the success of the Coalition government struggle&quot;. The Minister of Information Mr. Sillah was contacted by Gambian reporters about the story but he made it clear to them that nothing of what Aidara said ever happened in the Gambia. But they failed to report his denial message purposely to hide the truth. I wrote about it yesterday and decided to make an audio about it today. Have a great day.@Senegal5.com- 5TV Sénégal{% endraw %}
