{% raw %}Moments of brilliance sometimes come from odd places. The “Spaghetti Western” is one such example, a film made by Italians about American gunslingers and cowboys filmed in various locales along the coast of the Mediterranean. It’s an unusual idea that somehow left us with some of the most iconic and revered moments in cinematic history. It’s not just the world of film, however; many cars that have found their way across the Barrett-Jackson auction block carry their quirky brilliance in stride. Where else are you going to see a three-wheeled dump truck, an off-road MINI and the unrepentant king of cool – the Yugo – share a stage? The diversity of Barrett-Jackson’s collector car docket has long been a hallmark of what makes The World’s Greatest Collector Car Auctions so special.
