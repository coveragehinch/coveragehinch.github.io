{% raw %}The House select committee investigating the attack on the US Capitol just issued a new round of subpoenas for several Trump-associated ne'er-do-wells, including Roger Stone, Alex Jones and others. It's clear that Congress is making its way up the insurrection food chain, looking to haul in and place under oath the planners, funders and organizers of the attack on our democracy. Let's hope the next subpoena stop includes the inciters: Rudy Giuliani, Don Jr., Mo Brooks, John Eastman - as well as the inciter-in-chief, Donald Trump. <br /><br />As I mention in the video, you can follow historian and Boston College Professor Heather Cox Richardson on Twitter @HC_Richardson and you can subscribe to her daily news letter at heathercoxrichardson.substack.com<br /><br /> For our Team Justice and Justice Matters merchandise shop, please visit: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/">https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/</a><br /><br />Please consider becoming a #TeamJustice patron at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner">https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner</a><br /><br />My podcast, &quot;Justice Matters with Glenn Kirschner&quot; can be downloaded where you get your podcasts.
