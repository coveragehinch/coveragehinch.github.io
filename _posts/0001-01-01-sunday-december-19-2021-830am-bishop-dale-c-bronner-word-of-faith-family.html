As an interdenominational church, we join with likeminded Christians in spreading the Gospel around the world.<br /><br />&quot;Reaching the Lost and Teaching the Found&quot; is more than just a catchy phrase. We hope the phrase gives you insight into who we are and the ministry to which we are called.<br /><br />Christ reached out to people of all ages and backgrounds and at our church we desire to do the same. That is why here you will discover ministries geared to various life stages and needs. We have a place for everyone to study Scripture, fellowship together, and minister to others through numerous service opportunities.<br /><br />We want you to be an active part of the blessings of God in the life of our church. Thank you for joining us today!{% endraw %}
