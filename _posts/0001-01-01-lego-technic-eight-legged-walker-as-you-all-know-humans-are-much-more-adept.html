{% raw %}As you all know, humans are much more adept at building with wheels and tracks than with legs. Although we see the legs God made around us constantly. Because of humans' linear thinking, it's very hard for us to construct a machine with such complexity. (Let alone be strong and fast enough to do anything practically) But, I made a good honest attempt here. If any of you noticed how fragile the legs look, I want to reassure you that they have been reinforced with a secondary frame above the hips. (My video was already made by this time, so I didn't bother showing it.){% endraw %}
