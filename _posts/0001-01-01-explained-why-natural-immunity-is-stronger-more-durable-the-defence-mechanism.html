{% raw %}The defence mechanism of Natural Immunity has shown good resistance not just to delta but to Covid variants in general. If you are previously infected, you have antibodies not only in the blood (IgG) but also the nose and the lungs (IgA) which acts as a baarrier to new infection. This amazing story of naturally acquired immunity has been explained in a wonderful research study article. We are happy to share the key points in this video.<br />USEFUL LINKS:<br />1.
