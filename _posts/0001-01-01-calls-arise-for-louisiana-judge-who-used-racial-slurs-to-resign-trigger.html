{% raw %}Trigger Warning: Offensive Language <br /><br />Outrage is growing tonight after a video captured a judge in Lafayette, Louisiana, using racist and derogatory language.  <br /><br />There are calls for the immediate resignation of Michelle Odinet from a growing list of organizations. <br /><br />Judge Odinet told news outlets that she doesn't remember what happened because she took a sedative at the time the video was made. <br /><br />In the video you can hear people laughing and using racial slurs while they watch a TV displaying security footage of what appears to be a foiled robbery outside of Odinet's home. <br /><br />BNC correspondent Jamiese Price has the latest on the people leading the charge. <br /><br />All this and more on “Making the Case.” <br /><br />To watch BNC programming, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bnc.tv/how-to-watch/">https://bnc.tv/how-to-watch/</a> <br /><br />Follow BNC on social media: <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BNCNews">https://www.facebook.com/BNCNews</a>  <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BNCNews">https://twitter.com/BNCNews</a>  <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bncnews/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/bncnews/?hl=en</a> <br /> <br />#MichelleOdinet #Louisiana #MakingTheCase{% endraw %}
