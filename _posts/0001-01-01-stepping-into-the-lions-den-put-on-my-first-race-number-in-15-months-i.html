{% raw %}Put on my first race number in 15 months. I thought, what the hell, give it a go and have some fun in your local crit. Charon, Cesar, Mike, Arturo, and I lined up against the nation's number team and had a solid game plan on how we could upset them. It nearly worked. Go inside my head and what I was thinking within the last few laps.{% endraw %}
