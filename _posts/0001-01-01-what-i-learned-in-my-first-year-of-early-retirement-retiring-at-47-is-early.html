{% raw %}Retiring at 47 is early by any definition. In this episode, Jason reflects on his first year in early retirement. Not everything went smoothly as you might expect. Learn what's changed, what's been better, what's worse, and - importantly - has it lived up to his expectations? If you're excited to reach this milestone but still harbor some reservations about crossing into &quot;retirement&quot;, Jason offers a grounded, thoughtful perspective on what to expect and how to prepare for such a life-altering transition.<br /><br />Read more about his journey on his blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thenextphaseisnow.com/">https://thenextphaseisnow.com/</a><br />His milestone post from year 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thenextphaseisnow.com/learnings-from-year-one/">https://thenextphaseisnow.com/learnings-from-year-one/</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00 Things change<br />00:34 Describe an ideal FI day<br />02:36 What's better and what's worse?<br />03:42 Uh oh...<br />04:50 Setting deadlines<br />05:30 Confronting &quot;white space&quot;<br />07:33 Opening doors<br />08:30 Consulting dilemma<br />13:00 Jason's current &quot;job&quot;<br />15:00 Changing net worth<br />17:06 Every day's a vacation (day drinking)<br />18:37 Relationship changes<br />20:07 Bored yet?<br />22:28 Concerns for year two<br />24:30 Advice for those preparing to FIRE<br />28:54 Changes in friendships + relationships<br /><br />Eric here, sending massive respect to Jason for editing this entire episode. I joked with him after we finished recording it that his next &quot;skill development task&quot; was to learn Final Cut ProX and edit the episode. He agreed, not knowing the depth and form my critical feedback would take nor the time and effort making changes would entail. And, although I don't think this marks a permanent shift in our roles for this project, I do think it gave each of us a better perspective on the skills we bring to the collaboration.<br /><br />**Tools, resources + information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twosidesoffi.com">http://twosidesoffi.com</a><br />**Our podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twosidesoffi.com/podcast/">https://twosidesoffi.com/podcast/</a><br /><br />**Eric’s business: 30X40 Design Workshop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thirtybyforty.com">https://thirtybyforty.com</a><br />**Eric’s YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thirtybyforty.com/youtube">https://thirtybyforty.com/youtube</a><br /><br />#twosidesoffi #financialindependence #firemovement<br /><br /> @30X40 Design Workshop{% endraw %}
