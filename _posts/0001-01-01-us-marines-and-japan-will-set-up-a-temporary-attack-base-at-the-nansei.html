{% raw %}US Marines and Japan will set up a Temporary Attack Base at the Nansei Islands near Taiwan<br /><br />US Marines and Japan will set up a temporary attack Military base at the initial stage of a contingency on the Nansei Islands, a chain stretching southwest from the Japanese prefectures of Kagoshima and Okinawa toward Taiwan. Okinawa hosts the bulk of U.S. military installations in Japan.<br /><br />Japan's Self-Defense Forces and the U.S. military have drawn up a draft joint operation plan that would enable the setup of an attack base along the Nansei island chain in the country's southwest in the event of a Taiwan contingency, according to Japanese government sources.<br /><br />The U.S. military will get support from the SDF to send troops to the islands if a Taiwan contingency appears imminent, the sources said.<br /><br />Such a deployment, however, would make the islands the target of attack by China's military, putting the lives of residents there at risk. Legal changes would be needed in Japan to realize the plan, the sources said.{% endraw %}
