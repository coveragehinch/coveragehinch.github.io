{% raw %}This is a tutorial I made for the hacking  games by hosted games and choice of games text based games. I hacked one of the hosted games in this tutorial is The Great tournament. However, One can use the same technique to Hack any game by hosted games or choice of games. <br /><br />There are many independent and talented writers on hosted games and thus support them by purchasing their games.<br /><br />I don't monetize my videos but do leave a like if it works for you and comment if have any query.<br /><br /><br /><br />What you need for the tutorial <br /><br />Total Commander File manager :<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghisler.android.TotalCommander&amp;hl=en_IN">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghisler.android.TotalCommander&amp;hl=en_IN</a><br /><br />Lucky patcher<br /><br />Stepwise guide:<br /><br />1. No need to use Virtualxposed for it, it's your choice. <br /><br />2. Simply open total commander and browse to the apk file you want to hack. <br /><br />3. Open it as a zip file and extract all its content to where ever you like. <br /><br />4. Go to the extracted folder and browse to asset folder to my game and then scenes.. You will find a file named startup and startup.jsoc file. You have to edit these files to get the desired values. It varies from game to game thus you have to figure out which values you want to change. Also keep in mind that values you change in startup files should be same as the values you change in jsoc file. <br /><br />5. When it's done, select all the files in extracted folder and zip it again. Though make sure to rename and adding extensions of.Apk <br /><br />6. Now open lucky patcher, and select rebuild and install option in lower right corner. Select it and browse to the place you created the new modified apk.
