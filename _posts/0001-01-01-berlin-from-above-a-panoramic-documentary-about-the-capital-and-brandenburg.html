{% raw %}25 years after the reunion between East and West Germany, this movie shows pictures from different perspectives of people and country, during a glide flight above the metropolis. Which visions and dreams marked this region? What changed and what emerged from the cityâ€™s contentious history? We take a look from above to see the city and its citizens. <br /><br />//////////////////////<br /><br />Subscribe to the channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/cZ67sM">https://goo.gl/cZ67sM</a><br /><br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/wocomo">https://www.facebook.com/wocomo</a><br /><br />The movie unites nature, urbanity, tranquility and the rush of a metropolis. It unites parks and skyscraper canyons, lake capes and wetlands, curvy courses of rivers and straight streets. With exhilarating pictures, we take a trip through Berlin - from sunrise until sunset.<br /><br />Due to high quality flight recordings and panorama pictures, we can get a glimpse at how the people make this area their home.<br /><br />Produced by: Dokfilm, rbb<br />A Film by: Jan Tenhaven<br />2016, licensed by Autentic{% endraw %}
