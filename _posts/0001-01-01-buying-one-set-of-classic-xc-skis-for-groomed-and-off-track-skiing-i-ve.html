{% raw %}I’ve finally come to terms with the fact that most people aren’t like me. They simply don’t suffer from the financially detrimental affliction known as “gear lust.” For reasons incomprehensible, they don’t constantly experience that nagging condition which compels me to buy multiple sets of cross-country skis to accommodate every possible snow condition.<br /><br />If only I was rich I could own all the skis!<br /><br />But because most people are smarter than me about their finances, I’m always asked, “What’s the one type of cross-country ski that I could buy that will let me ski in a groomed area and off-trail?”<br /><br />Alas, if only such a set of skis existed I might not have so much credit card debt!<br /><br />Yes, you could buy just one set of skis to perform both tasks. However, that one set would not accomplish either task very satisfactorily.<br /><br />Contrary to all of the hype and marketing by cross-country ski manufacturers, in my opinion, there just doesn’t exist one type of classic cross-country ski that will meet all of a person’s needs.<br /><br />Watch the video for my two cents worth, as well as some recommendations for buying such a set of classic cross-country skis.<br /><br />And for more detailed information about buying classic cross-country skis, read my articles at Tahoe Trail Guide:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tahoetrailguide.com/buying-cross-country-ski-gear-for-beginners-part-1/">https://tahoetrailguide.com/buying-cross-country-ski-gear-for-beginners-part-1/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tahoetrailguide.com/buying-cross-country-ski-gear-for-beginners-part-2/">https://tahoetrailguide.com/buying-cross-country-ski-gear-for-beginners-part-2/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tahoetrailguide.com/buying-cross-country-ski-gear-for-beginners-part-3-can-one-set-of-classic-cross-country-skis-work-for-groomed-and-off-track-xc-skiing/">https://tahoetrailguide.com/buying-cross-country-ski-gear-for-beginners-part-3-can-one-set-of-classic-cross-country-skis-work-for-groomed-and-off-track-xc-skiing/</a><br /><br />• <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Patreon.com/JaredManninen​">https://Patreon.com/JaredManninen​</a> (monthly contributions of $3, $6, $9, $39, or $99)<br />• <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://PayPal.me/JaredManninen​">https://PayPal.me/JaredManninen​</a> (option for making a single, one-time monetary contribution)<br />• <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://venmo.com/u/TahoeTrailGuide">https://venmo.com/u/TahoeTrailGuide</a> (option for making a single, one-time monetary contribution)<br />• <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://JaredManninen.RedBubble.com​">https://JaredManninen.RedBubble.com​</a> (merchandise account featuring my outdoor-related imagery)<br /><br />I've produced this collection of articles and videos about backcountry travel and exploration with the beginner and intermediate adventurer in mind. This is the demographic for whom I most often served while working in the Lake Tahoe outdoor recreation industry.
