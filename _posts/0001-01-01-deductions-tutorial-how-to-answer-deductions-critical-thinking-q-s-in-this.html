{% raw %}In this deductions tutorial, our expert test developer talks through how to answer an assumptions question from a critical thinking test.<br /><br />Candidates will be provided with a passage of information and candidates will need to evaluate a list of deductions made based on that passage.<br /><br />If one cannot deduce a particular statement from the passage, then that deduction does not follow, and the candidate must select which deductions follow and which do not follow.<br /><br />The answer must be entirely based on the statements made and not on conclusions made from oneâ€™s own knowledge.<br /><br />Try our free Critical Thinking tests here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.assessmentday.co.uk/watson-glaser-critical-thinking.htm">https://www.assessmentday.co.uk/watson-glaser-critical-thinking.htm</a><br /><br />Buy now our Critical Thinking practice pack:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.assessmentday.co.uk/buy/critical-thinking-buy.htm">https://www.assessmentday.co.uk/buy/critical-thinking-buy.htm</a>{% endraw %}
