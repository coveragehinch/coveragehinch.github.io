{% raw %}A recent survey for UN Women UK found that 80% of women of all ages in the UK said they had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces, of which men are overwhelmingly the perpetrators.<br /><br />At Commonplace, we are providing local authorities with a Community Heatmap to help support the development of safer places. The aim is to create a dialogue to improve places by first understanding areas where women &amp; girls feel unsafe but enable them to provide feedback on what would make them feel safer.  <br /><br />In this webinar, Commonplace Chair, Pam Alexander OBE will host a panel discussing the key challenges in creating safe streets and how engagement can build partnerships to create safer environments for women &amp; girls. This will include Keith Stranger, London Borough of Islington; May East, UNITAR Fellow; and prominent campaigners.{% endraw %}
