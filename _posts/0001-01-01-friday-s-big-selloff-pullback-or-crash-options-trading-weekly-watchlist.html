We go over key levels of support and resistance and create an actionable game plan for the week of November 29th 2021.<br /><br />In the SPY we saw a pretty aggressive sell side day on Friday. That being said, we need more information on wether or not the selling will continue. With the half day and significant amount of volume being transacted, it would appear as if there is more room for lower into the prior highs and then a re-evaluation. Not only would it be the 50 SMA, it would be the 50% fib re-tracement. Watch the financial sector for a heads up on higher or lower early on in the week.<br /><br />In the QQQ and Nasdaq we see less impact from the news on the variant. Obviously tech is more resilient to economic shut down and doesn't have the financials sector weighing down on the upward progress. Its all about the head and shoulders and the neck line at 390 which is also the 38.2 fib.<br /><br />IWM and the small cap stocks have now officially seen the look above and fail back down firmly into the range. The small caps have the most to lose in terms of shut downs and travel restriction. Being back in the middle of the range they are signaling neutral risk....again...<br /><br />We also look at the following trade ideas: AMD, AMAT.<br /><br />00:00‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äì Intro<br />01:02 ‚Äì Broad Market (SPY, QQQ, IWM)<br />12:38 ‚Äì Core Companies (AAPL, NFLX, TSLA, BABA, FB, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN)<br />21:55 ‚Äì Trade Ideas (AMD, AMAT)<br /><br />If you're a day trader looking to make fast money online options trading, you certainly need to keep these areas of support and resistance in mind, as well as any technical patterns, before the opening bell on Monday morning. Stock analysis like this will save you a ton of time.<br /><br />Going into the day with a plan is important and will give your options trading the edge you need to be a successful retail day trader. This stock analysis gives you that edge.<br /><br />Instead of looking at stock market news and googling 'stocks to trade today' or best options to buy today, every Monday morning, technical analysis makes my job a lot easier. A quick glance at the stock chart can tell me where to expect buying and selling battles. <br /><br />Our core watchlist are the stocks that are always on our options trading weekly watchlist. Some people call them hot stock picks but we like to call them our ATM.<br /><br />Friday's BIG Selloff - Pullback or Crash?! | Options Trading Weekly Watchlist<br /><br />#OptionsTrading #TradeIdeas #TechnicalAnalysis<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: The information provided in this video is for informational purposes only.
