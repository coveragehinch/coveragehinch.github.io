Huge thank you to those who have already donated. It is not necessary but very appreciated and helps me continue to do what I do for everyone.<br /><br />☾ Affirmations Explained ☾<br /><br />Hello beautiful souls,<br /><br />I created this affirmations video to attract your specific person - it all starts with you! Third party? No problem. Don't acknowledge it, and just focus on your confidence and the thoughts you have about mostly on you but also your Specific person! A good rule is 80% affirmations on self, and 20% about your SP. Because when you focus on you, so does your SP. Get rid of the the drama you learned from movies etc... and affirm the love you actually want and deserve!<br /><br />Affirmations help create new thought patterns, also known as reprogramming your subconscious.  The more you repeat phrases or affirm the more change you will see and feel.  This video is a tool to help you manifest the version of you and the life you wish to have. <br /><br />Feel free to play this video on loop or play as you sleep (yes it is okay if you fall asleep -- you will still reprogram)<br /><br />Please do not listen when driving or operating heavy machinery. Best results in the morning when you first wake, or when going to bed.<br /><br />Be sure to come back and repeat the phrases daily at the very least for 30 days.<br /><br />Not sponsored.<br /><br />Music by Singto Conley - Broken Fairy Lullaby - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=71AF553C">https://thmatc.co/?l=71AF553C</a><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />❗️WARNING❗️<br />Please do not listen when driving or operating heavy machinery.<br /><br />LEGAL DISCLAIMER<br />There are no guarantees or promises, implied or explicit this will work for you. This does not substitute any type of professional health care and I am not reliable for any decisions others  made because of this or any other video on my channel.<br /><br />Affirmations and subliminals are tools and in my opinion help when &quot;living in the end&quot; (a term used when you feel like you have your desires). These videos are also tools to help you manifest in a lot of areas in your life. I make these because they've helped me personally and I believe in these tools. I recommend you to do your own research and study affirmations, subliminals and law of assumption. Use at your own discretion.{% endraw %}
