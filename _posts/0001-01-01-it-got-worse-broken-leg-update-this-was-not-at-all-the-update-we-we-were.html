{% raw %}This was not at all the update we we were hoping for. Catch up on vlogs here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK9I7WGZrgU&amp;list=UUyCyTe_1bT2aIPwG_gxbyeg&amp;index=6">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK9I7WGZrgU&amp;list=UUyCyTe_1bT2aIPwG_gxbyeg&amp;index=6</a><br /><br />We hope this video can encourage other families who've gone through similar situations and show kids they aren't alone during scary times. We are stronger together. ❤️ #GetWellSoonOllie #BrokenLegUpdate #SpicaCast{% endraw %}
