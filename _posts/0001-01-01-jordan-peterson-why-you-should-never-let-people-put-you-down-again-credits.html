The videos we produce have elements like visuals, audio, and background music Which are not owned by us. But thanks to the fair use policy we are able to use clips e.g. from interviews and Jordan Peterson's lectures and transform them by adding commentary in the form of animation and video footage. Here is how we work. Our editors brainstorm video ideas, then analyze hours of interviews and videos across youtube. After finding the clips, we then stitch them together, add music to provide an immersive experience, and commentary in form of video footage and whiteboard animation. This commentary helps transform the video to be unique as well as gives the original clips a new perspective. We also add text animations to emphasize important messages in the video.<br /><br /><br />Follow us on Social Media:<br />Discord:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/js7V6beX">https://discord.gg/js7V6beX</a><br />Instagram:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wiseadvicemotivation/">https://www.instagram.com/wiseadvicemotivation/</a> ABOUT WISE ADVICE{% endraw %}
