{% raw %}If you’re looking for an example of the worst possible way to terminate employees, look no further than the CEO of personal loan company Better.com. He used a company Zoom meeting to inform 900 employees that they were all being fired, effective immediately. Better.com is worth an estimated $8 billion, and employs more than 6,500 people. Fortune Magazine recently ranked the company first on it’s Best Place to Work list. The nearly 1,000 people out of work before the holidays might disagree.{% endraw %}
