{% raw %}The Song is written by Les Reed and Geoff Stephens. Originally recorded by Stephens' group the &quot;New Vaudeville Band&quot; in 1966 as a neo-British music hall number. <br /><br />The first single version of &quot;There's a Kind of Hush&quot; was recorded in 1967 by &quot;Gary and the Hornets&quot;, a teen/pre-teen male band from Franklin, Ohio and became a regional success. Their &quot;A Kind Of Hush&quot; showed signs of breaking nationally in January 1967, however an expedient cover by Herman's Hermits was released in the US in February 1967 to reach the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100 in three weeks and proceed to a peak of #4.<br /><br />Peter Noone and his Hermits entered a lot of charts worldwide with &quot;There's a Kind of Hush, with #2's in Canada, Malta and Singapore.<br /><br />IMPORTANT:<br /><br />The idea of edPLAY VMV channel is to combine good sounding music with recorded images of the artists, so that watching and listening are in greater balance.<br />This often means that images and sound from separate recordings have been used and edited as a whole.<br />edPLAY does not intend to generate money by raising advertising income.<br />edPLAY is not owner of the images or sound records, nor means edPLAY any harm to the owners.<br /><br />The &quot;edPLAY logo stamp&quot; in the left corner is only meant for an uniform appearance (when played in the channel's playlist), NOT intended as an ownership claim!<br /><br />If you are the owner of this content: <br /><br />PLEASE contact us by email, before you make your complaint knowable to YouTube.
