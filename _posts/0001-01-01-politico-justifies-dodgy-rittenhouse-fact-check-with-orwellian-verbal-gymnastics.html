{% raw %}Politico had to go through “Orwellian double speak verbal gymnastics” to justify a dodgy fact check on Kyle Rittenhouse’s possession of an AR-15, according to Digital Editor Jack Houghton.<br /><br />The Kyle Rittenhouse trial in America centres around a 17-year-old who shot two protesters dead and injured a third during civil unrest riots.<br /><br />Prosecutors had charged Rittenhouse in relation to bringing his AR-15 rifle across state borders before the shooting, but the court had not ruled on the issue.<br /><br />Fact checker Daniel Funke, while working for Politico, fact checked the claim that it was perfectly legal to carry the particular gun across state borders, and declared the claim false.<br /><br />This week the judge in the trial, due to the rifle’s length, found it was in fact legal for Rittenhouse to take the rifle across state borders.<br /><br />Politico subsequently issued a statement on Funke’s fact check which read: “In August 2020, we fact-checked a claim that it was “perfectly legal” for Rittenhouse to possess an AR-15 without parental supervision. Our reporting found that it was far from perfectly legal, and that it was, in fact, legally murky. That’s why we rated the claim False.”<br /><br />Mr Houghton said it should not be a defence that “because Funke or Politico didn’t understand the law it meant the law was murky”.<br /><br />“A judge did understand the law and the charge was dismissed on the spot,” he said.<br /><br />“His words were clear, not murky.”{% endraw %}
