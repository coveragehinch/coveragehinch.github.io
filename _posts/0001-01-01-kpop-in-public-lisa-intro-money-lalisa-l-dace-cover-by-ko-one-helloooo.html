{% raw %}Helloooo cute!!! üß°üß°<br /><br />We are again with this cover, well, we know that we are not very fast uploading new covers but we always try to bring the best for you bestie! <br />This time we have recorded LALISA by LISA (from BLACKPINK), in KOONE we love blackpink, and obviously we love Lisa and her first solo! üëÄüëÄ<br /><br />This is OUR FIRTS SOLO, to be specific is the first solo of IRENE ( <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jn.irene/">https://www.instagram.com/jn.irene/</a> ), give her a lot of love and support because she has worked so hard with her solo despite all the problems we have had in rehearsal time. Do you think Irene looks a lot like lisa?
