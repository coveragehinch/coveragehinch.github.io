{% raw %}Conducting workplace investigations is one of the most challenging HR duties, but also one of the most important. Some of the most common mistakes include: not taking the situation seriously, not conducting an investigation at all, failing to write a report, or failing to follow up with those involved. That sets employers up for trouble should that employee end up filing a lawsuit. On the other hand, conducting an investigation in a prompt, thorough, and fair way can be your first line of defense should a situation come back to haunt you.{% endraw %}
