{% raw %}Bungie is making one of the biggest changes they've ever made to the sandbox: they are breaking up ability cooldowns.  No longer will all grenades be on the same cooldown, all melee on the same cooldowns.  Not only that, but significant changes are being made to super energy and how we'll generate it.  PvP is targeted as well, with Bungie hoping to promote primary gun battles and reduce ability spam.  Lots to go over, so grab a seat.<br /><br />Sorry the thumbnail sucks, I didn't have time to make a better one.<br /><br />Abilities in Crucible - 0:00<br />Super Energy Generation - 3:31<br />Super Cooldown Tuning - 6:40<br />Perk/Exotic Adjustments for PvP - 8:14<br />Stasis/Class Notes - 11:59<br />My Thoughts - 19:05<br /><br />5% discount on ASTRO gear: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.astro.family/DATTO">http://www.astro.family/DATTO</a> (works in all available regions)<br /><br />Save $50 dollars when you buy a pre-built PC from Evolve PCs when you use code DATTO at checkout: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.evolvepcs.gg">https://www.evolvepcs.gg</a><br /><br />Epic Games Store Creator Code: HelloDatto<br /><br />Danielle's Advanced.GG code: TRVL at checkout (Datto has no affiliation with advanced.gg)<br /><br />Need a good chair?
