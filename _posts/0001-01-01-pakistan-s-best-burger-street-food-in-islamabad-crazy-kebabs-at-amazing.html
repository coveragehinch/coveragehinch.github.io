{% raw %}Rediscover Pakistan with MANAKY! üáµüá∞ Manaky is your one-stop shop for all your travel resources in Pakistan (curated tours, rentals and local experiences)!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.manaky.com">https://www.manaky.com</a><br /><br />For our last day in Islamabad, we are showing you some of the BEST non-traditional cuisine Pakistan has to offer. Islamabad is an international city, where people from around the world live and work. That being said, your options for dining reflect modern, global cuisine. <br /><br />We had breakfast at Burning Brownie, one of the few places in Pakistan to find amazing brewed coffee and western sweets. For drinks we ordered latte, flat white and a macchiato. They were perfect! For treats we ordered their Caramel Crunch cake, Biscoff cake and their Fudge cake! Their cakes were fantastic as well as their funky ‚Äú50s era diner‚Äù atmosphere. <br /><br />It was time for lunch, and we decided we wanted a juicy, charcoal grilled burger!!! We went to Howdy Islamabad for an American style lunch. The owners were incredibly friendly and gave us an amazing welcome. They wanted us to try quite a few items on the menu, so we tried their starters, milkshakes and more even before the burgers arrived at the table. We tried their signature burger ‚ÄúSon of a Bun‚Äù along with some of their top burgers: We also tried some of their desserts. Everything was very high quality and super delicious! <br /><br />In the evening, we went to a restaurant well known for their Afghani food, New Kabul Restaurant. All of the food is made fresh to order, right before your eyes! We ordered Afghani Kebabs (minced meat), Afghani Tikka (meat chunks), Kabuli Pulao (steamed rice with carrots, raisins and meat) and Mutton Karahi. This restaurant was MEAT HEAVEN!!!<br /><br />For our final stop of the day and our last stop in Islamabad with our friend Sulmeen, we visited Tandoori Junction for their famous tandoor chai. What makes this chai special is that clay cups are super heated in the tandoor, and the chai cooks inside the cup instead of a pot. Not only does it enhance the flavour of the chai, it‚Äôs awesome to watch the preparation! Thank you Sulmeen for showing us your beautiful city!<br /><br />Addresses: <br /><br />Burning Brownie - Beverly Centre, Shop #66 F6ÿå 1 Nazim-ud-din Rd, F 6/1 Blue Area<br />Howdy! - Gol Market, Shop 6ÿå F 7/3 F-7<br />New Kabul Restaurant - Plot No. 17, F-7 Markaz, Jinnah Super Market, F-7 Markaz F-7<br />Tandoori Junction - College Rd, F-7 Markaz F 7 Markaz F-7<br /><br />Prices:<br /><br />Burning Brownie (cakes &amp; coffees)<br />2402 PKR (USD $13.67) <br /><br />Son of a Bun Burger<br />799 PKR (USD $4.55) <br /><br />Prawn Star Burger <br />749 PKR (USD $4.26) <br /><br />Afghani Kebabs<br />760 PKR (USD $4.33) <br /><br />Afghani Tikka <br />760 PKR (USD $4.33) <br /><br />Kabuli Pulao <br />500 PKR (USD $2.85) <br /><br />Mutton Karahi <br />1060 PKR (USD $6.03) <br /><br />Tandoor Chai<br />150 PKR (USD $0.85) <br /><br />What a fantastic last day in Islamabad!
