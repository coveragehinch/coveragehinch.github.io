{% raw %}Idler editor Tom Hodgkinson chats to artist and author Lauren Child about creativity, making a living as a writer and the value of staring into space.<br /><br /><br />Lauren Child arrived on the children’s book scene in 1999. She is the creator of many much-loved characters including Ruby Redfort, Charlie and Lola, Hubert Horatio and of course, Clarice Bean. In 2018, HarperCollins Children’s Books published the exquisite hardback, gift edition of 'Mary Poppins', P.L. Travers’s classic story which was brought to life in full colour with Lauren’s unique signature style. She won the prestigious Kate Greenaway Medal in 2000 for 'I Will Not Ever Never Eat a Tomato' and was announced as the tenth Waterstones Children’s Laureate in 2017. Her latest book is 'Clarice Bean: Think Like an Elf' (Harper Collins).<br /><br /><br />This conversation was recorded as part of the Idler's weekly online event, A Drink with the Idler. The full recording is available to magazine and Academy subscribers via idler.co.uk. Visit the website to join.{% endraw %}
