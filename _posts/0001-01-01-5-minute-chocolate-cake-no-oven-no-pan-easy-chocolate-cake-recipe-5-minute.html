For a 9 or 10 inch container check the cake after 5 min, if the cake isn't ready leave it a bit longer making sure to keep an eye on it. If you're using a smaller container ( 7 - 8 inch) cut the recipe in half and check the cake after 3 min. Use a microwave safe bowl. DO NOT refrigerate this cake!<br /><br />Easy Chocolate Frosting:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K825cO-qUtU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K825cO-qUtU</a><br /><br />Enjoy!<br />♥<br /><br />Copyright © 2020 Emma Fontanella.
