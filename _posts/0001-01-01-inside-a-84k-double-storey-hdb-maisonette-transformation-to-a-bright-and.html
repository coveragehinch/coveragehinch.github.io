{% raw %}This week, we visit our first Maisonette in our Living In series, a large and spacious 1,593 square feet 4 Room HDB Maisonette in Tampines. For homeowners Faezah and Zul, this is their second home, with their first home in a different concept - which was something more industrial and moody. This time, they wanted their place to look more open and homely. <br /><br />Despite the previous owner having closed and partitioned up the space, they knew that they wanted to open everything up from the beginning to accentuate the space of the unit. With 1,593 square feet of space spread over 2 floors, the living/dining and kitchen areas are on the first level, with all the bedrooms located on the second. They decided to freshen things up in the dining room with a unique blue splash of paint, as well as different tiling options for the kitchen area too. A special feature is their yard area, as it features a super high ceiling along with a retractable shutter (from the previous owner) in case of rain. <br /><br />Special thanks to Faezah and Zul for showing us around their beautiful home.
