{% raw %}&quot;Great dreams aren't just visions,&quot; says Astro Teller, &quot;They're visions coupled to strategies for making them real.&quot; The head of X (formerly Google X), Teller takes us inside the &quot;moonshot factory,&quot; as it's called, where his team seeks to solve the world's biggest problems through experimental projects like balloon-powered Internet and wind turbines that sail through the air.
