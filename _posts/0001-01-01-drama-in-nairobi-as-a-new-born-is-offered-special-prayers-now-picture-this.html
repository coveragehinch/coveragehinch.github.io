{% raw %}Now, picture this... A two-month old baby is repeatedly tossed high up in the air only to be gathered not by the lovely arms of an excited mother but a gathering of frenzied men and women! The agenda is not to frighten the baby or alarm the mother. Rather, it is ostensibly to exorcise demons from the baby and to formally welcome it into the tough world. This is an important rite of passage of the African Roho Msalaba church. Judy Kosgei with the story of this unique but scary ritual.{% endraw %}
