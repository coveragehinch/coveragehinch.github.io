{% raw %}Tesla Giga Berlin chronicler Tobias Lindh yesterday spotted the first Model Y Performance at Giga Berlin with a made-in-Germany VIN number.<br /><br />&quot;I saw a Model Y Performance today at #GigaBerlin.  I've had a look at the VIN. It is made in Germany,&quot; Tobias wrote on Twitter sharing some images.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the existence of a VIN from Giga Berlin and a license plate don't imply that this Model Y Performance is production unit, rather than a test unit. Tesla can't sell this vehicle. Also, this doesn't imply that the actual mass-production has started at Giga Berlin.<br /><br />Some people in Germany state that they expect their Model Y EV crossovers to come in 2 weeks. Does this mean they are coming from Giga Berlin or Giga Shanghai from China? <br /><br />Tobias says &quot;I could imagine that Tesla hopes to be able to deliver from Giga Berlin in 2 weeks. Does anyone know whether ships from China are already sailing to Europe with performance models? They also need more than two weeks to get here.&quot;<br /><br />#Tesla<br /><br />Giga Berlin 1st Model Performance Y with VIN.
