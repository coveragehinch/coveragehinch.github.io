{% raw %}y'all ask for this so here it is,<br />i swear this is the last one i'm gonna make. after that, there will be no more of these.<br /><br />If you don't know who is Vidia, Vidia's debut is in the '10 Things not to do in Christmas Part 1' video. She is 16 years old. She's part of the iCherry gang. Her Smile Precure AU's alter ego is 'Cure Dusk'.<br /><br /><br />original: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRUzkxxkVuM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRUzkxxkVuM</a>{% endraw %}
