I had to get away from him, but I could hear his footsteps, he was right behind me. <br /><br />Then I noticed the public bathroom, I ran inside and stood there, gasping for breath. As my breathing began to come back to normal I looked at my reflection in the bathroom mirror.<br /><br />I watched in terror as my beautiful face turned into something out of a horror movie.<br /><br />And if you think that is shocking, you will never believe what happens at the end of this video.<br /><br />I hadn’t had a very easy childhood, you see, to say that I was ugly was a huge understatement. Even though my parents tried to reassure me that it was what was inside that mattered. I couldn’t help wishing that I hadn’t been born so ugly.<br /><br />It was difficult for me, especially at school. The other kids would always laugh at me and call me names,<br /><br />“Hey, what’s it like having the face of an ogre?”<br /><br />I learnt to ignore their words, but it still hurt. The only thing that saved me was that I was really smart. At least I had that I suppose. Imagine if I had been ugly and dumb! Now that would really have been awful.<br /> <br />But luckily I had been born with some brains, and I used them to the best of my ability. I loved entering competitions because I knew that I was sure to win. And when the kids at school saw me collecting trophy after trophy they had to congratulate me. <br /><br />I remember once there was this huge science fair in our town, everyone at school was talking about it because the first prize was $1000.<br /><br />“I really could do with that money, I’m definitely going to enter.”<br /><br />“Me too! I already know what I’m going to spend the winnings on!”<br /><br />I laughed to myself when I heard them talking, because I knew that they had no chance of winning. I had already entered and I knew that whatever invention they came up with, there was no way it would be better than mine. And I was right! You should’ve seen their faces when they announced the winner.<br /><br />“And the first prize goes to Jessica!”<br /><br />As I walked up to collect my trophy and prize money, a huge grin spread across my face. I looked over at all of my competitors, the disappointed look on all of their faces made up for all of their horrible teasing.{% endraw %}
