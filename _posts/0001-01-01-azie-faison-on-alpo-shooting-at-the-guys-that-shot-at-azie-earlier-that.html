Faison explained he had a previous issue with an individual that was ultimately settled. Later, however, one of his workers had a verbal altercation with the same man which escalated into Faison getting shot at. After Alpo found out about the attempt on Faison's life, he willingly involved himself in the matter and retaliated. A day later, the beef was squashed without either side suffering any casualties.{% endraw %}
