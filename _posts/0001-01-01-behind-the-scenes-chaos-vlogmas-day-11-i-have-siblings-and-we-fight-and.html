{% raw %}I have siblings and we fight and fuss A LOT. It has become less because we grew up, live separately and tend to miss each other so when we see each other it's less fighting but still lol. Anyway, I didn't know other siblings experienced the same issues so whilst taking photos this happened ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ <br /><br />Welcome to real life. Thank you to Tashe, Boaz, Jubal and Loryn for being a part of my Christmas VLOGMAS &quot;STUFF&quot;. I love you all!{% endraw %}
