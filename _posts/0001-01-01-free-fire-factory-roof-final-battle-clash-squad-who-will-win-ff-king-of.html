Drive vehicles to explore the vast map, hide in trenches, or become invisible by proning under grass. Ambush, snipe, survive, there is only one goal: to survive and answer the call of duty.<br /><br />[Survival shooter in its original form]<br />Search for weapons, stay in the play zone, loot your enemies and become the last man standing. Along the way, go for legendary airdrops while avoiding airstrikes to gain that little edge against other players.<br /><br />[10 minutes, 50 players, epic survival goodness awaits]<br />Fast and Lite gameplay - Within 10 minutes, a new survivor will emerge.
