{% raw %}KINDNESS WILL SAVE THE WORLD<br /><br />Have you ever wondered why it’s important to be kind? Kindness can change the whole world and you can make the world better by such simple acts as holding open a door for someone, saying something nice to your colleague, sharing food with someone who needs it. Being kind can truly change people's lives. Moreover, it’s important to treat people how you would like to be treated and the result will be positive. Even scientists say that being kind can positively affect your health. It literally strengthens your heart because of the release of hormones. Also, an act of being kind to others reduces stress levels. Kindness works like a boomerang and comes back to you.
