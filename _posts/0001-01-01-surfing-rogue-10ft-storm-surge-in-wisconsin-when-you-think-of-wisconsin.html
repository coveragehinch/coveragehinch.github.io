{% raw %}When you think of Wisconsin the first thing that comes to mind isn't usually surfing. Even though Chicken Joe from Surfs Up is in fact from this very town, its not exactly imagined as a surf destination. Especially not a surf spot with 10ft waves! However, we got a call from some of our good friends in Wisconsin &amp; they invited us out for a storm supposedly pushing in 10ft lake surge that was going to be surfable! A complete &amp; total rogue surfing experience, but I was happy to answer the call, jump on a flight &amp; catch a couple waves on Lake Michigan in the midwest! Thanks for the stoke, I hope you enjoy! - Ben<br /><br />Follow Us on Instagram:<br />@bengravyy<br />@jverni_<br /><br />Clothes &amp; Accessories:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wavebandit.com/collections/ben-gravy">https://www.wavebandit.com/collections/ben-gravy</a><br /><br />Wetsuits:                          <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hyperflexusa.com/categories/bengravy/">https://hyperflexusa.com/categories/bengravy/</a><br /><br />Soft Top Surfboards:      <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wavebandit.com/collections/ben-gravy">https://www.wavebandit.com/collections/ben-gravy</a><br /><br />CBD Aloha: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cbd-aloha.com/">https://cbd-aloha.com/</a><br /><br />Fiberglass Surfboards:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.superbranded.com/collections/ben-gravys-picks">https://www.superbranded.com/collections/ben-gravys-picks</a><br /><br />Skateboards:                  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sector9.com/blogs/surf/ben-graeff">https://www.sector9.com/blogs/surf/ben-graeff</a><br /><br />Music in this VLOG:<br /><br />Missing Memories<br />Christoffer Moe Ditlevsen<br /><br />Kenji<br />Ooyy<br /><br />Raise Your Shoes<br />Splasher!{% endraw %}
