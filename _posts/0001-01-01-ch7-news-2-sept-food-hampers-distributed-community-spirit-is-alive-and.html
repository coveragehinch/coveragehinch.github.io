{% raw %}Community spirit is alive and kicking with 350 food hampers delivered to those in need courtesy of OzHarvest, Resilience NSW and Cumberland City Council.<br /><br />Mayor Steve Christou says we’ve proven we’re a strong and resilient community and we will come through this again as we did before.<br /><br />“One thing COVID-19 can’t lockdown is the support we’ve given and received. OzHarvest will provide the hampers to Council’s Auburn Depot this week and we’ll deliver them to vulnerable residents and those experiencing hardship, plus 125 local refugee families we’ve been able to get in touch with thanks to the Asylum Seekers Centre based in Newtown.<br /><br />“The hampers are a mix of dry goods, like rice, long life milk, canned items, and fresh produce, including eggs. It is enough to help feed two people a meal a day for a week. Resilience NSW will supply wipes, face masks and hand sanitiser in each hamper.<br /><br />“Just last week we delivered 300 food hampers to locals most in need thanks to a whopping 300kg meat donation from farmer Robert Mackenzie’s Mackas Angus Beef. I’m pleased that we’ll be collaborating with dedicated organisations to distribute hundreds more in the next couple of weeks.<br /><br />“Families in the area have been doing it tough. With the shutdown of businesses, there have been many families who have no household income, but still have to pay bills.<br /><br />“I’m glad we can pull together a gesture the community can appreciate and be proud of. I thank everyone involved for their support and generosity.”<br /><br />OzHarvest connected with Council via the weekly regional emergency operations command (REOC) meetings, coordinated by Resilience NSW. OzHarvest is supplying bulk hampers to the LGAs of concern.<br /><br />Project Lead from OzHarvest, Shannon Richardson, said the demand has surged over the last few weeks with the organisation supporting 700 families a week with emergency food relief hampers.<br /><br />“We are thrilled to be working so closely with councils during this lockdown as it means more food is getting to people in need. We’re looking forward to providing Cumberland City Council with hampers this week and kick-starting their food relief initiative in their community.”<br /><br />If you know someone in need or if you have something to offer, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cumberland.nsw.gov.au/covid-19-community-support-exchange">https://www.cumberland.nsw.gov.au/covid-19-community-support-exchange</a>{% endraw %}
