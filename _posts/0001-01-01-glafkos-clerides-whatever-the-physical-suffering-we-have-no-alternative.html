{% raw %}Turkish invasion of Cyprus | A divided Cyprus | This Week | 1974<br /><br />CLERIDES INTERVIEW<br /><br />(Reporter) &quot;-If the Turks do virtually take over the<br />whole island there is nothing that you can do about it is there sir?<br /><br />(Clerides) &quot;-Militarily they can occupy the whole of Cyprus but they're not going to occupy it through a capitulation of us. We certainly we will fight and there will be come a time when<br />Mr. Ecevit's armorcraft will not be so usable because certainly we will<br />fight in the hills. <br /><br />(R) -You're talking about guerrilla warfare? <br /><br />(C) -I am talking about a long protracted warfare which will wage from the hills.<br /><br />(R) -So are you saying therefore that it is quite impossible unless they retreat enormously to have<br />any kind of peaceful solution that the war goes on? <br /><br />(C) -That is exactly what I am saying. <br /><br />(R) -Does that mean that whatever the physical suffering of the Greek people<br />have to bear that you will fight them in the hills rather than that?<br /><br />(C) -Whatever the physical suffering we have no alternative but to fight there are<br />certain commodities in life which even to secure physical comfort to not<br />constitute negotiable commodities and the freedom of one's people, the freedom of one's loved<br />is not a negotiable commodity&quot;{% endraw %}
