The location was apparently empty, and the whole endeavor was risky â€“ what, if anything, was going to show up? But what came back was nothing short of spectacular: an image of over 1,500 galaxies glimmering in a tiny sliver of the universe. Alex Hofeldt helps us understand the scale of this image. <br /><br />Lesson by Alex Hofeldt, animation by Bliink.<br /><br />Hubble Deep Field Image Credit: R.
