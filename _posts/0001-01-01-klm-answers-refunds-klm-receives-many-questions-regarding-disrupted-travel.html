{% raw %}KLM receives many questions regarding disrupted travel plans due to the coronavirus. We understand things may be uncertain or unclear at present, so we’d like to keep you informed with a new series called “KLM Answers”, answering your most frequently asked questions. Our first topic: refunds and vouchers. 🎫<br /><br />Update 14-9: our Refund Policy has been adjusted to allow you more flexibility by offering a refundable voucher. You can request a refundable voucher – free of charge and for whatever reason – for all tickets with a planned departure up and until 31 March 2021.
