{% raw %}Sorry for the Late uploads and big gaps! We had problems with Computer not exporting the files correctly! All fixed now and we can get back to uploading videos!<br /><br />Make sure you subscribe to follow our daily lives in this farm!  <br /><br />Hey to everyone!!<br />We are two young adults, Despina 22 and Deivids 23 renovating an old farm house from 1817 in Latvia. Everything in and out of our house has been done by ourselves with no hired help. Soooo far everything is going great and there haven't been any incidents.<br />DIY is going to apply to nearly everything in our house. Our budget is tight and that has made us appreciate every &quot;ugly&quot; part of this house and turn it into something new and beautiful.<br />We give new life to things that others would throw away!<br /><br />In this journey we are not alone! We are starting up our little Farmily and part of it are<br />5 Goats<br />3 Sheep<br />4 chickens<br />1 Rooster<br />and 3 Geese<br />Oh yeah and my cat Ivi <br /><br />Despite our daily problems we are two young people full of joy and happiness, ready to start a new crazy chapter in our life. It wouldn't be fair to keep this fun for us!<br />that's why we want YOU to be also part of our Farmily!!<br /><br />We love our very supportive community!! <br /><br />Thank you so much for the support you are giving us.
