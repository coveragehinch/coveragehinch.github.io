{% raw %}There are 9 CraiggerBear Locations in Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart for the UnBEARably Awesome trophy (Find all CraiggerBears).<br /><br />Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart CraiggerBears Text/Screenshots Guide: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.powerpyx.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-all-craiggerbear-locations/">https://www.powerpyx.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-all-craiggerbear-locations/</a><br /><br />CraiggerBears are Collectibles. They look like teddy bears. Unlike other Collectibles they don't get marked on the map when you go near them, which makes them the hardest to find.<br /><br />None of the CraiggerBears are missable. You can return to all planets after the story in free roam (resume completed story save to be put back before the final checkpoint). You can track your overall progress via the PS5's built-in trophy tracker, but there's no way to tell which bear exactly you're missing. The only way is to recheck all spots manually, which is luckily really quick to do.<br /><br />CRAIGGERBEARS TIMELINE:<br /><br />#1 - 0:00<br />#2 - 0:21<br />#3 - 1:13<br />#4 - 1:34<br />#5 - 2:10<br />#6 - 2:30<br />#7 - 2:51<br />#8 - 3:19<br />#9 - 3:58<br /><br />Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart Trophy Guide &amp; Roadmap: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.powerpyx.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-trophy-guide-roadmap/">https://www.powerpyx.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-trophy-guide-roadmap/</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=powerpyx">https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=powerpyx</a><br /><br />Support this Channel by becoming a Member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWBA1-H9A5IldSb3tNwQmtQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWBA1-H9A5IldSb3tNwQmtQ/join</a><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Follow PowerPyx:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.powerpyx.com">https://www.powerpyx.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/PowerPyx">https://www.youtube.com/PowerPyx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PowerPyx">https://www.facebook.com/PowerPyx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/PowerPyx">https://www.twitter.com/PowerPyx</a><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{% endraw %}
