{% raw %}JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Authorities in Indonesia are considering building an island prison for convicted drug traffickers that would employ crocodiles instead human guards, the Daily Telegraph reports. Actual people can be bribed, you see. And Indonesia has a lot of that.<br /><br />Indonesia has some of the harshest penalties for drug crimes, including death. According to the Daily Telegraph, there is also a lot of corruption and drugs flooding into the prison system of Indonesia, with inmates and jail officials regularly getting arrested for drug offenses. Another reason they want to make the prison devoted to drug traffickers is so they don't recruit other inmates for drug gang activity.<br /><br />Anti-drugs chief Budi Waseso told local news website Tempo: &quot;We will place as many crocodiles as we can there. I will search for the most ferocious type of crocodile. You can't bribe crocodiles. You can't convince them to let inmates escape.&quot;<br /><br />As for the inmates themselves: &quot;We will keep sending them food supplies every day. But they have to survive on their own,&quot; Waseso added.  The location and opening date have not been decided yet.<br /><br />----------------------------------------­---------------------<br /><br />Welcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.
