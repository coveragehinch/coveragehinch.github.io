{% raw %}Hello!  It's Tuesdays Daily Vlog and Missy shows you our trees around The Wild Lands, with hints and tips as well as some of the history around their uses in Portugal.<br /><br />We attempt to go daily through November. Which with terrible weather an poor internet is already a challenge! Our plan was to show you our daily life and tribulations on our off grid land. Answer more of your questions and take you with us on a day to day basis...<br /><br /><br />We are now the proud owners of a stunning off grid property in Portugal, Lobateira, which we've renamed 'The Wild Lands'. We've been searching for our own slice of heaven to start a homestead. We decided to base our search around the Castelo Branco region of Portugal, as the land here is not only beautiful, but far cheaper than the Algarve. Equally, there are many off grid families in the region, and we wanted to be close to a community of like-minded people. <br /><br /><br />We were 'stuck' in the UK (again) since returning to see loved ones over Christmas while we waited for our D7 Visa for Portugal. After nearly 6 months of waiting, we got to leave! This was a mammoth task as we had to transit through France to Spain in 24 hours or less! (see previous videos) Now we've finally bought our own at land in Portugal. Follow us on our adventure in the sun! (and sometimes biblical Portuguese rain!!!) As we start turning The Wild Lands' into our own off grid heaven.<br /><br /><br />ðŸ”· SUPPORT US - BUY US A COFFEE (or Guinness or Dog Wiccies)<br />â–¸ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/thoseweirdos">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/thoseweirdos</a><br /><br /><br /><br />ðŸ”· Those Weirdos AND Van Life MERCH (available for worldwide shipping)<br />â–¸ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.vannertee.com">http://www.vannertee.com</a><br /><br />Please let us know what you think or what other merchandise ideas you'd like us to look at adding.<br /><br /><br /><br />ðŸ”· WHO ARE WE?<br />We are Those Weirdos, A FAMILY OF 7: 3 people, 2 cats and 2 dogs living and traveling full time living the Vanlife in our self converted Sprinter van.  <br /><br />We have a passion to improve our film making and VLOG our LOVE of full-time travel.
