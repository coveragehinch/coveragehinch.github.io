Heading into the new year, these are the questions many investors are asking.<br /><br />Alain Corbani, head of mining at Finance SA, shared his thoughts, saying that in order to perform the yellow metal needs a weak US dollar and negative or declining real rates. <br /><br />In 2021, the market got the opposite — a stronger US dollar and higher real rates. But &quot;what we had in 2021 is not going to be repeated in 2022,&quot; he explained.<br /><br />#Investing #Mining #Gold<br /><br />0:00 - Intro<br />0:23 - Interpreting the Fed's rate hike plans <br />3:40 - Alain's thoughts on inflation next year<br />6:54 - Why gold didn't rise more in 2021<br />8:31 - Will gold's prospects improve in 2022?<br />12:47 - Powell won't shock the US economy<br />15:43 - Other gold price factors to watch <br />21:13 - Outlook for gold stocks in 2022 <br />26:29 - Outro<br /><br />________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br />Investing News Network (INN)<br /><br />Find out more about investing by INN @<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://investingnews.com/">https://investingnews.com/</a><br /><br />Follow this link to learn more about Gold ↓<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2ZlNHlb">https://bit.ly/2ZlNHlb</a><br /><br />Want a FREE investor kit?
