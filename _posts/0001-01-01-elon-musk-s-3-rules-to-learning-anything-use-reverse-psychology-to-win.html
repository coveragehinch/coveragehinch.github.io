After visiting a number of aerospace manufacturers around the world, Musk discovered the cost of purchasing a rocket was astronomical‚Äîup to $65 million. Given the high price, he began to rethink the problem.<br /><br />‚ÄúI tend to approach things from a physics framework,‚Äù Musk said in an interview. ‚ÄúPhysics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So I said, okay, let‚Äôs look at the first principles. What is a rocket made of? Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, plus some titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. Then I asked, what is the value of those materials on the commodity market? It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around two percent of the typical price.‚Äù<br /><br />Instead of buying a finished rocket for tens of millions, Musk decided to create his own company, purchase the raw materials for cheap, and build the rockets himself. SpaceX was born.<br /><br />Within a few years, SpaceX had cut the price of launching a rocket by nearly 10x while still making a profit. Musk used first principles thinking to break the situation down to the fundamentals, bypass the high prices of the aerospace industry, and create a more effective solution.<br /><br />First principles thinking is the act of boiling a process down to the fundamental parts that you know are true and building up from there.<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />üîî WANT MORE VIDEOS LIKE THESE AT $0.00 COST?<br /><br />The school system does not want us to learn about Finance and Self-improvement but BETTER CHAPTER is doing that, It's up to us<br /><br />Subscribe by clicking here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/CLICK-T0-SUBSCRIBE">http://bit.ly/CLICK-T0-SUBSCRIBE</a><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />üë®‚Äçüíª ADDITIONAL LINKS &amp; RESOURCES<br /><br />How People Are Using Tai Lopez‚Äôs Social Media Marketing Agency To Get Paid $1,000-$10,000 a Month!<br /><br />Click here to Watch your First Lesson: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tailopez.com/flow.php?id=FS-4463&amp;aff=2621240">https://www.tailopez.com/flow.php?id=FS-4463&amp;aff=2621240</a><br /><br />We‚Äôve asked Tai Lopez if he‚Äôd be willing to present a complimentary ‚Äúintroduction‚Äù to his program‚Ä¶And after a bit of hesitation‚Ä¶He said, ‚ÄúYES!‚Äù We cannot promise you this training will be around forever‚Ä¶ But, as of today, it‚Äôs available (just for you!)<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />ü§ñ MY FAVOURITE TOOL<br /><br />Discover my NEW secret weapon for making Ebooks in 60 SECONDS...
