To begin with the imprisonment leader ability grants us two locks, we have the stratagem collar granting us an additional lock and also 2x Van Moorlehem Hunters. The poisons we generate from our scenario card can allow us to destroy a unit, and as forms of tall punish we have Yennefer's invocation and Vincent Van Moorlehem. Fergus is used in this deck as a way to boost each of our Thirsty Dame units by 3, and provides consistency in setting up a good target for Terranova to generate.<br /><br />The thinning in this deck is optimal enough to ensure we draw all of our gold cards by the end of a match, as long as we thin on time. We have a 2x Blightmaker package, Fercart and also Deadman's Tongue to take care of that.<br /><br />Overall a long round three seems to favour this deck, considering all the different ways way can shutdown our opponents strategy. However, as always consider your opponents strategy and their objective, and do your best to counter that.<br /><br />I can assure you that if you play this deck as i have outlined in the deck guide of the video, you will win matches. I believe i went on something like a 7-2 win streak with this.<br /><br />Hope you will all enjoy the video and thankyou very much for your time.<br />Best wishes for this new year! Lets all get great together.<br /><br />Peace.<br />KG{% endraw %}
