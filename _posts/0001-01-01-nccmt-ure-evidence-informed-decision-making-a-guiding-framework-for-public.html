{% raw %}Making evidence-informed decisions in public health is complex and may draw from many sources of evidence, The model of evidence-informed decision making (EIDM) from the NCCMT recognized that complexity and illustrates the many different kinds of evidence that influence public health decisions.<br /><br />This video shows how the EIDM model adapts to the availability and relative importance of various types of evidence in a particular situation. Using the example of rates of respiratory illness, which the research evidence links to vehicle emissions, we look at how two communities incorporate other sources of evidence to reach very different evidence-informed decisions.<br /><br />Evidence-Informed Decision Making: A guiding framework for public health introduces a helpful guide for ensuring all relevant evidence is collected, assessed, synthesized and prioritized, helping you make most appropriate decisions for your circumstances.<br /><br />The National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools is funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada and affiliated with McMaster University. The views expressed herein do not necessarily represent the views of the Public Health Agency of Canada.<br /><br />NCCMT is one of six National Collaborating Centres (NCCs) for Public Health. The Centres promote and improve the use of scientific research and other knowledge to strengthen public health practices and policies in Canada.{% endraw %}
