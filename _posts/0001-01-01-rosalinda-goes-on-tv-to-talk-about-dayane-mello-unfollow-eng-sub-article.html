{% raw %}ARTICLE BELOW:<br /><br />Dayane Mello closed with Rosalinda Cannavò?  Are the two former best friends of Big Brother Vip 5 at loggerheads again? <br /><br /> It is not the first time that Dayane Mello and Rosalinda Cannavò have quarreled and we are sure it will not even be the last.  During her experience as a competitor of the Brazilian reality show La Fazenda, the supermodel had been strongly supported by her Italian friend Rosalinda, aka Adua Del Vesco.<br /><br /> The topic was dealt with in the new episode of Casa Chi on Instagram, where the journalist Gabriele Parpiglia explained that he had always been in contact with Brazilian journalists and televisions, defined by him as more serious than those of the Fazenda: &quot;They told me 'Look that when she comes out she will pretend nothing has happened '.  They've been telling me this for a long time.  They told me 'Look, this is a losing battle' &quot;.<br /><br />The reporter continued in the story by explaining that when Dayane was eliminated he waited to figure out what would be the first step to take.  On the contrary, an envoy of the Hyenas activated by interviewing Dayane who confessed to having seen the images and that she was fine: &quot;She said that you have seen everything and that she is calm, she is fine.  [...] She was angry with me, I attacked her because she is famous and now she is famous in the world.  She was angry with Rosalinda, I'll tell you the specific reason: you went to visit her daughter without her permission.  And she was also angry with her former agent because she says that she has moved the ranks of all this, &quot;said the host of Casa Chi.<br /><br /> When the Hyena correspondent asked Dayane to send her a video in which she claims to have seen the images and that she is fine, Dayane said before her that she would send him and then she disappeared.  &quot;This is Dayane Mello,&quot; Parpiglia said.<br /><br /> Dayane Mello's friend, Rosalinda Cannavò, said: &quot;I would like to say first of all that I agree with Gabriele.  I stood up for this cause and will always and regardless.  I do it because it is my principle, because I went through it firsthand.  I would do it again.  I do not know if it is an initial phase in which perhaps she does not realize what has happened, I also put this hypothesis ».<br /><br /> She specified that she did not stop following Dayane on Instagram, as was initially assumed: «I want to clarify one thing, hypotheses are made, even if it has little relevance to what happened.  I read that Dayane and I have stopped following us.  In reality she didn't go that way, she blocked me on Instagram.  She didn't block me on Whatsapp, I wrote her several messages including support.  She looked at my messages and she never replied.  I went to Sofia at the invitation of Dayane's ex-mother-in-law, so not against anyone's will.  I was invited ».<br /><br /> She concluded her speech by stressing to continue to support her and reiterated that she does not agree with the way of acting that she is now choosing the Brazilian showgirl and model.{% endraw %}
