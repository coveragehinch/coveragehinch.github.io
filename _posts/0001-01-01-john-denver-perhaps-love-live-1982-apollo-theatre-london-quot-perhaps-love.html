{% raw %}&quot;Perhaps love is like a resting place<br />A shelter from the storm<br />It exists to give you comfort<br />It is there to keep you warm<br />And in those times of trouble<br />When you are most alone<br />The memory of love will bring you home<br /><br />Perhaps love is like a window<br />Perhaps an open door<br />It invites you to come closer<br />It wants to show you more<br />And even if you lose yourself<br />And don't know what to do<br />The memory of love will see you through<br /><br />Oh, love to some is like a cloud<br />To some as strong as steel<br />For some a way of living<br />For some a way to feel<br />And some say love is holding on<br />And some say letting go<br />And some say love is everything<br />And some say they don't know<br /><br />Perhaps love is like the ocean<br />Full of conflict, full of change<br />Like a fire when it's cold outside<br />Or thunder when it rains<br />If I should live forever<br />And all my dreams come true<br />My memories of love will be of you&quot;{% endraw %}
