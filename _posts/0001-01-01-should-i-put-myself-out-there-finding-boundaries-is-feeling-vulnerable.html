{% raw %}Hi, Beauties! Come and spend some time with me, finishing paintings, which is hard! Also, I have been pondering about vulnerabilities around sharing online which can seem like a big question. Should I put myself out there? What should we share with the world? Do we need boundaries on social media? I've also been working on my Etsy shop with James, making new jewellery with beads and packing orders too. I've been through my whole collection of packaging materials to re-use and recycle anything I possibly can but also letting go of the clutter that I just don't need. I think most importantly this week, I have been continuing on my quest for a work-life balance, or, what I like to think of as a work/rest balance. I think improving my space and organising my studio definitely helps me be more productive in my working hours and therefore gives me more time off to rest. Getting there slowly! I just need to work on my consistency with it all! As always, thanks for keeping me company, my biggest loves, Wendy.
