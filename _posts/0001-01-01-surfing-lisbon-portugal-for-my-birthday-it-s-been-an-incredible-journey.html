{% raw %}It's been an incredible journey to celebrate my marriage &amp; now my 33rd birthday here in Portugal. It's legit a dream come true to travel the world &amp; surf places I've watched as a kid &amp; dreamed of surfing my entire life. If I can inspire or remind anyone out there watching to do anything it would be to get up &amp; get going. Chase those things that you've always wanted &amp; fill your life with passion &amp; stoke! I'm already 33, time flies, we should enjoy it!! - Ben<br /><br />Follow Us on Instagram:<br />@bengravyy<br />@jverni_<br /><br />Clothes &amp; Accessories:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wavebandit.com/collections/ben-gravy">https://www.wavebandit.com/collections/ben-gravy</a><br /><br />Wetsuits:                          <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hyperflexusa.com/categories/bengravy/">https://hyperflexusa.com/categories/bengravy/</a><br /><br />Soft Top Surfboards:      <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wavebandit.com/collections/ben-gravy">https://www.wavebandit.com/collections/ben-gravy</a><br /><br />CBD Aloha: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cbd-aloha.com/">https://cbd-aloha.com/</a><br /><br />Fiberglass Surfboards:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.superbranded.com/collections/ben-gravys-picks">https://www.superbranded.com/collections/ben-gravys-picks</a><br /><br />Skateboards:                  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sector9.com/blogs/surf/ben-graeff">https://www.sector9.com/blogs/surf/ben-graeff</a><br /><br />Music in this VLOG:<br /><br />Chicken Got No Head<br />River Foxcroft<br /><br />No Stranger to Dirt<br />Kick Castle<br /><br />Granny Dance<br />Scoobadive<br /><br />Feel So Lucky (Instrumental Version)<br />Cody Francis<br /><br />Into the Distance<br />Guustavv{% endraw %}
