{% raw %}Whether @everyone comes to this video to find an easier way to hit Heavy Transports in capital systems, or to learn about unique ways to crew with officers, there's good here! This video focuses on a crew that's becoming more popular for big hostile hits for players and we break down why with some fun battlelogs here. Even if you have low tier versions of some of these officers you can still have nice success!<br /><br />Topics covered:<br /><br />1. Crunching the numbers! (nerd) with battlelogs!<br />2. A better crew than Pike Moreau Tlann?<br />3. Scopely, you better not touch this!<br />4. If you have any game mechanic questions, feel free to drop those questions in the comments!<br /><br />Join the Twitch Family!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/revdeuce">https://www.twitch.tv/revdeuce</a><br /><br />#StarTrekFleetCommand<br />#STFC<br />#getrektm8<br /><br />***********************************<br /><br />Sick merch is here!
