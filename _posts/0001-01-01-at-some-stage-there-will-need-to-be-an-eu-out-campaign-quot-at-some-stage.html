{% raw %}&quot;At some stage there will need to be a single designated 'out campaign' and we will see who is part of it,&quot; the chair of Conservatives for Britain told the BBC's Andrew Neil.<br /><br />Discussing the UK's current negotiations with the EU, Steve Baker MP said he would &quot;love to back the prime minister&quot; but made it clear that some MPs were preparing for an &quot;out campaign&quot; on the basis that early indications suggest their demands over the sovereignty of parliament in the UK would not be met.<br /><br />Conservatives for Britain is a new group of 50+ MPs who want radical change in our EU membership terms - including restrictions on free movement of people and sovereignty for the UK parliament. However, Mr Baker said some colleagues who signed up to the group were &quot;not necessarily committed to any particular red line.&quot;{% endraw %}
