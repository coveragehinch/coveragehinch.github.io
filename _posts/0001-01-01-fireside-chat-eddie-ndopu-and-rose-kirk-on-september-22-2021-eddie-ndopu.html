{% raw %}On September 22, 2021, Eddie Ndopu, disability advocate and co-collaborator on The Harkin Institute's DI Dialogue series and Rose Kirk, Verizon’s Chief Corporate Social Responsibility Officer, talked about the value creating possibilities of disability inclusion. <br /><br />Their conversation covered important topics such as:<br />- Reimagining the discourse pertaining to “building back better” in a way that centers disability justice and intersectionality?<br />- Is there any through-line between DEI, environment, social, and governance investment practices and the UN Sustainable Development Goals? If so, can “it” be leveraged to drive systems change?{% endraw %}
