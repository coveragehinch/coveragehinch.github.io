{% raw %}The holidays are here, and we're about to see a ton of sales for popular essential oils left and right. The design of our modern culture is based around marketing and often selling us things we don't truly need. <br /><br />This is a problem when it comes to essential oils because these precious botanical substances are honestly not sustainable (so much plant material is needed to produce them) at the rate of growth of the essential oil market and the skyrocketing popularity of aromatherapy. <br /><br />When we face our next essential oil buying decision we should all ask ourselves if we truly need that EO or if we just want it. Are we falling for the flashing lights, big discounts, and the allure of &quot;the 5 reasons you need this oil now!&quot;, or do we truly need the aid of the plant we're seeking?<br /><br />In this video I discuss some very important topics as we move further into a world of higher demand, lower production, and more plants on the endangered species list.<br /><br />If you enjoy this video please share it with your friends on social media.<br /><br />Subscribe to our channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsQNX-9eWJs4fN3qFvApFZg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsQNX-9eWJs4fN3qFvApFZg</a><br /><br />And if you’re ready to take your next steps to learn more, enroll in our online courses here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aromaticmedicineschool.com/programs/">https://aromaticmedicineschool.com/programs/</a><br /><br />Here’s our natural and sustainable incense products and incense crafting supplies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://highermindincense.com/">https://highermindincense.com/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/aromatic_medicine">https://instagram.com/aromatic_medicine</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/NorhtwestSchoolofAromaticMedicine/">https://www.facebook.com/NorhtwestSchoolofAromaticMedicine/</a>{% endraw %}
