{% raw %}What will you do when you have no more medicine? China controls over 80% of the pharma market. A conflict will see worse trade wars than you could imagine. We are going to be facing some of the hardest times of our lives as a group but those times will not be without opportunity.<br /><br />Our nation will be among the luckiest if we do not take part in a multi national event between China and Taiwan in the next 6-12 months. That may seem like a long period of time since we have become sadly accustomed to globally disruptive events taking place on an almost weekly pace but that time period gives each one of us a lot of time to prepare.<br /><br />While we cannot prepare to take on a multi national war on all fronts, we can prepare for the secondary events that do affect our families. The past 12 months have shown the world that the supply chain is and always has been an anomaly. It is and always has been a peaking and then waning marvel of human connectivity. The lesson that we all learned was that if you do not grow it or make it, then you do not own it and that goes for the things that we need on a personal level and how commodities and manufacturing is handled on a national level. <br /><br />Estimates suggest that half of the items that are for sale to Americans are imported items and that is a western problem that does not sit alone in America‚Äôs lap. From the UK to Canada, Japan, and Australia, we will begin seeing a falling off of product availability that will continue to affect modern life.<br /><br />In the example noted insulin is the most important item that needs stop gap measures. There are dietary things that an insulin dependent person can do to help and according to the National institute of Health, there are natural dietary items that can help act as life saving or stop gap measures if insulin becomes unavailable including the following from: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924971/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924971/</a> | ‚ÄúCostus igneus, commonly known as insulin plant in India, belongs to the family Costaceae. Consumption of the leaves are believed to lower blood glucose levels, and diabetics who consumed the leaves of this plant did report a fall in their blood glucose levels.‚Äù<br /><br />#BREAKING #ECONOMY #NEWS<br />The news is here because of members like you!  üõë PLEASE HELP TO SUPPORT WHAT WE DO üõë <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/fullspectrumsurvival">https://www.patreon.com/fullspectrumsurvival</a>   ---  Join us on there!
