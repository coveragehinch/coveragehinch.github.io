{% raw %}&quot;I've Come To Expect It From You&quot; was George Strait's 30th single. It was released from his 1990 album &quot;Livin' It Up&quot; and it went on to become his 20th number one single. The song was written by Dean Dillon and Buddy Cannon.<br /><br /><br /><br />I don't own this song - It belongs to George Strait and MCA Records.{% endraw %}
