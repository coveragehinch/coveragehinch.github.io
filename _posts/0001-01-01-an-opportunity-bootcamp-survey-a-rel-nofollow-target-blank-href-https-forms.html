I'm Petu and the purpose of my YouTube channel is to share my passion for League of Legends. I've climbed to Challenger 1200 LP on EUW and EUNE by playing Shen. I am currently studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science in Finland. In my spare time, I enjoy running, basketball and disc golf. Thanks for reading this far!<br /><br />#LeagueOfLegends #Challenger #LoL{% endraw %}
