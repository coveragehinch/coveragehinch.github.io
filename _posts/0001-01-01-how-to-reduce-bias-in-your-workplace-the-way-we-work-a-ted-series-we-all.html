{% raw %}We all have bias -- especially the unconscious kind -- and it’s preventing us from doing our best work. Gone unchecked, bias can make employees feel resentful, frustrated and silenced, and it can even lead to outright discrimination and harassment. These are the 3 ways to reduce bias at work, according to Just Work co-founders, author Kim Scott and CEO Trier Bryant.<br /><br />The Way We Work is a TED original video series where leaders and thinkers offer practical wisdom and insight into how we can adapt and thrive amid changing workplace conventions.
