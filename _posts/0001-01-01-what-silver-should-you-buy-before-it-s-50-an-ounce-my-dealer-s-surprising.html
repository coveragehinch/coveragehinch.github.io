{% raw %}What should should you buy when it comes to silver now that we've gone through the pandemic?  What silver do you want to have when the price eventually goes to $50 an ounce--or $100 an ounce?  American silver eagles, the Canadian silver maple leaf?  Do you wonder what silver to purchase?  Do you wonder if the pandemic should affect your silver purchases?  Should you buy sovereign or government-minted silver bullion?  Do silver bars matter most?  Does it really matter at ALL what silver you buy if the silver price goes about a certain point?  My silver dealer gives his surprising answer!<br /><br />ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆ GET YOUR ONLINE GOLD AND SILVER HERE âž¡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sdbullion.com/yankee">https://sdbullion.com/yankee</a><br />ðŸ”” TEST YOUR METALS WITH THE POCKET PINGER! âž¡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3gvYynx">https://bit.ly/3gvYynx</a><br /><br />I stack silver and gold to hedge against our debt-fueled, fiat currency-based economy that I am convinced is nearing the end of the road!
