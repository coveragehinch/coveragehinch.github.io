{% raw %}100 Thieves announced the biggest fundraising round in history, raising 60 million <br />dollars and leaving the esports org Nadeshot founded 4 years ago valued a nearly <br />half a billion. <br /><br />100 Thieves have just finished a 60 million dollar round of fundraising, the largest <br />private fundraising ever for an esports org...leading to Forbes now valuing the org at <br />nearly half a billion dollars...and leaving fans to ask if that money could be used to <br />get 100 Thieves into even more esports. <br /><br />It also raises a question of just how valid that FaZe Clan valuation of 1 Billion dollars<br />when they went public really was, as a lot of journalists are having trouble believing <br />FaZe clan is worth more than twice what 100 Thieves are, especially after that 60 <br />million dollar fundraising round. But will that 60 million get Nadeshot and 100 <br />Thieves back into the HCS with a Halo Infinite team...or will Courage get his wish <br />and see 100 Thieves join up with Rocket League and the RLCS?<br /><br />Both options are easily achievable with this huge influx of new money, and 100 <br />Thieves has teased interest in both Halo and Rocket League, so hopefully those two<br />moves will now happen since they have an extra 60 million in the bank.<br /><br />// FOLLOW US<br /><br />Talent: <br />Jake: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky">https://twitter.com/JakeSucky</a><br />Hunter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HunterTheHerald">https://twitter.com/HunterTheHerald</a><br />Franke: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MegaphoneFranke">https://twitter.com/MegaphoneFranke</a><br /><br />Producer: <br />Peter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/VegasVanguards">https://twitter.com/VegasVanguards</a><br /><br />Check out our brand new channel, Gaming Shorts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/GamingShorts">https://bit.ly/GamingShorts</a><br /><br />Esports Talk is your leading source of gaming and esports news.
