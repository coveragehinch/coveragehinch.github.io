{% raw %}This video introduces an algorithm called POET (Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer) that is designed to continually invent increasingly complex and diverse problems, along with their corresponding solutions. Here, we demonstrate POET's potential by unleashing it on a problem space of two-dimensional landscapes and a solution space of robotic behaviors that aim to traverse them. In this domain, POET builds out a diverse collection of solved landscapes through experiments that modify previously-solved landscapes and apply and refine previously-discovered successful robotic gaits. The process culminates in robots able to skillfully traverse rugged obstacle-filled landscapes that are not solvable when approached in isolation with standard optimization techniques. The conclusion is that POET represents a step towards truly open-ended machine learning algorithms that continually invent and solve new challenges. <br /><br />For more information, see our corresponding blog post (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eng.uber.com/poet-open-ended-deep-learning)">https://eng.uber.com/poet-open-ended-deep-learning)</a> and research paper (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01753).">https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01753).</a> <br /><br />The  domain is adapted from Box2D Bipedal Walker in OpenAI Gym (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/#box2d).">https://gym.openai.com/envs/#box2d).</a> The featured music is one of iMovie sound effect selections (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/ilife09.pdf).">http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/ilife09.pdf).</a>{% endraw %}
