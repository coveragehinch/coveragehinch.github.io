{% raw %}Watch the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope—the most powerful space telescope ever made. This mission launched at 7:20 a.m. EST (12:20 UTC), Dec. 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana. Follow the telescope's status at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html">https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html</a><br /><br />With revolutionary technology, Webb will observe a part of space and time never seen before, providing a wealth of amazing views into an era when the very first stars and galaxies formed––over 13.5 billion years ago.<br /><br />It can explore our own solar system’s residents with exquisite new detail and study the atmospheres of distant worlds. From new forming stars to devouring black holes, Webb will reveal all this and more! It’s the world’s largest and most powerful space telescope ever built.<br /><br />Webb is an international collaboration between NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). Thousands of engineers and hundreds of scientists worked to make Webb a reality, along with over 300 universities, organizations, and companies from 29 U.S. states and 14 countries!<br /> <br />Ready to #UnfoldTheUniverse? The greatest origin story of all unfurls soon. Learn more at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nasa.gov/jwst">https://nasa.gov/jwst</a>{% endraw %}
