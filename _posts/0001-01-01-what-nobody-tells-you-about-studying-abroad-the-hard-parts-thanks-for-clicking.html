{% raw %}thanks for clicking on today's video. I really want to emphasize that not everyone's exchange experience is going to be the same, but I can tell you this... it's not all perfect. I've had an especially rough time recently and although this video is negative, it's honest and it's really how I've been feeling. I hope this video can give you some insight on things to take into consideration before going on exchange. exchange is a beautiful thing that offers so many amazing life experiences but you do need to be mentally prepared for when things get tough. thanks again for watching!<br /><br />MORE INFO ON CBYX <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://usagermanyscholarship.org">https://usagermanyscholarship.org</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://exchanges.state.gov/us/progra...">https://exchanges.state.gov/us/progra...</a><br /><br />FOLLOW ME ON MY SOCIALS :))<br />✽ instagram: @ carolineruby_ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/carolineruby_/">https://www.instagram.com/carolineruby_/</a><br />✽ tiktok @carolineabroad www.tiktok.com/@carolineabroad<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed and thanks again for watching! <br />- Caroline Ruby{% endraw %}
