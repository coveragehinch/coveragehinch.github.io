{% raw %}Over the years during periods of wellness, I have questioned my experiences with psychosis and schizophrenia. Did it really happen? Was I making it up? Do I actually have schizophrenia?<br /><br />I've come to learn that this is actually a common occurrence for people with psychotic disorders, and is actually part of anosognosia. I thought it would be valuable to share about this and open up more of a conversation around it.<br /><br />PLEASE HELP SUPPORT US IN CREATING RESOURCES AND COMMUNITY THROUGH OUR GOFUNDME: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/livingwellwithschizophrenia">https://www.gofundme.com/livingwellwithschizophrenia</a><br /><br />PATREON: <br />Help support us creating videos on schizophrenia and mental health!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/livingwellwithschizophrenia">https://www.patreon.com/livingwellwithschizophrenia</a><br /><br />SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://newsletter.livingwellwithschizophrenia.org/">https://newsletter.livingwellwithschizophrenia.org/</a><br /><br />TWO WEEK FREE TRIAL OF BETTER HELP (online counselling): <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://trybetterhelp.com/livingwell2free">https://trybetterhelp.com/livingwell2free</a><br />We do not currently offer online therapy.
