{% raw %}This went from a joyous moment in pursuit of wild food in what I thought was a sure thing.  Only it didn't work out that way.  I made shot on a nice buck which turned into a 2.5km 4 day long blood trailing that eventually dwindled out.  For most of it, I kept my camera off; part of that was because of the emotional shame I had felt about it and part of it was because the filming felt secondary to the task at hand which deserved my full attention.  That being said theirs a gap in the footage as I catch you up on my difficult experience and lesson in humility.    <br /><br />Ways Support the channel:<br /><br />Subscribe and share the videos and hit the notification bell so you know when the next video comes out and also be notified of the next live stream.<br /><br />Join Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sharingthewild">https://www.patreon.com/sharingthewild</a><br /><br />Work with me:<br />info@sharingthewild.ca<br /><br />All the music in my videos is sourced from Epidemic Sound:<br />Referral link <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/9ld428/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/9ld428/</a><br /><br />A bit about me:<br /><br />My name is Joseph and I’ve been living full time in my minivan since late September 2019. Moving into a vehicle was a necessary change and adaptation which I needed to make. I was working though a difficult stage in my life and I felt like this would give me the break I needed to sort things out and rebuild.  Along with this decision came an opportunity and new perspective on life, not to mention a real love and appreciation of nomadic living and living with less. So far it’s been quite a trip and I enjoy waking up each day feeling a bit more relaxed and strengthened from it.<br /><br />I’m based out of British Columbia, Canada. I work primarily in the yoga industry, however my small business does branch into teaching yoga, outdoor education, project management, consulting and some hands on projects.  Currently most of my work is undergoing a facelift as readjustments from the Covid-19 pandemic has necessitated a change.  Work aside I love to get out into nature to explore wild places and often bring back wild food and medicines. I love foraging for plants &amp; mushrooms, and of course hunting &amp; fishing. I’m also keenly interested in self development, coaching and counselling, cooking and process foods, problem solving, exploring, building, learning, healing, teaching, and most of all, being a Dad.  My goal here, is to share and build the journey with all of you and hopefully foster inspiration and elicit a positive change in the world.<br /><br />The world is my playground, my school, my mother and certainly not mine.<br /><br />Gratitude and much love<br /><br />Joseph<br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 Intro<br />01:21 Heading out to the hunting spot<br />03:19 Feels great to be here<br />03:50 Setting out to do some blood trailing<br />05:09 The catch up<br />07:30 End of the trail<br />09:40 Hoping for some help from the Ravens<br />10:27 Heading back in defeat<br />12:29 A summary of the full story{% endraw %}
