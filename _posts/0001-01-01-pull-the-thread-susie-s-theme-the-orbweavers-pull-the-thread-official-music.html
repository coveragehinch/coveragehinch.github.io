{% raw %}Pull the Thread - official music video by: Aya Hatano &amp; The Orbweavers<br /><br />Written in and out of Melbourne’s lockdowns, on the rhythm of daily walks in nylon tracksuit pants, with our greyhound companion Susie. Tracing a pattern of streets. Silent nights. Watching sewing and embroidery videos. Susie chews on the Venetian blind cord and unravels the weave of a blanket. Stuart buys a small handloom. On the hard days, I call out to Susie:  “Jump up!”. She bounds down the hallway and leaps onto the bed, a towering joyous wave. Drops and curls into a circle. Makes us smile.<br /><br />The video for ‘Pull the Thread’ is by Aya Hatano &amp; The Orbweavers, it features animated local streetscapes and waterways and cosmic greyhound journeys.{% endraw %}
