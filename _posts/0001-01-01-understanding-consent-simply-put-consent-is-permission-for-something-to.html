{% raw %}Simply put, consent is permission for something to happen or an agreement to do something. Sexual consent means both partners agree to the sexual activity and understand what they are agreeing to. Sexual activity includes kissing, sexual touching and sexual intercourse (oral, anal, vaginal). Consent is the foundation of sexual relationships and is needed for every sexual activity, every time.{% endraw %}
