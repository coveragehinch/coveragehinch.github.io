{% raw %}Our modern food system isn’t just harming animals—it’s harming the health of our communities, too. John Lewis (@BadAssVegan) came to Farm Sanctuary to discuss his new documentary They Are Trying to Kill Us, which explores the food insecurity crisis and the work of BIPOC community leaders who are creating greater access to the benefits of healthy, plant-based foods.<br />This film is available to watch, on demand, for $20—and when you access it through our affiliate link before 11/17, 50% of your purchase will go to support, care, and advocacy for farm animals: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://killusfilm.com/FarmSanctuary">https://killusfilm.com/FarmSanctuary</a>{% endraw %}
