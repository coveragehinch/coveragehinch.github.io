{% raw %}Huawei Consumer Brand Song<br /><br />Lyrics<br />I will run, I will climb, I will soar<br />I'm undefeated<br />Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord<br />Yeah, I believe it<br />The past is everything we were<br />Don't make us who we are<br />So I'll dream until I make it real<br />And all I see is stars<br />It's not until you fall that you fly<br />When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable<br />Take a shot, chase the sun<br />Find the beautiful<br />We will glow in the dark<br />Turning dust to gold<br />And we'll dream<br />It possible<br />Possible<br />I will chase, I will reach, I will fly<br />Until I'm breaking, until I'm breaking<br />Out of my cage, like a bird in the night<br />I know I'm changing, I know I'm changing<br />In, into something big<br />Better than before<br />And if it takes, takes a thousand lives<br />Then it's worth fighting for<br />It's not until you fall that you fly<br />When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable<br />Take a shot, chase the sun<br />Find the beautiful<br />We will glow in the dark<br />Turning dust to gold<br />And we'll dream<br />It possible<br />Possible<br />Possible<br />Possible<br />From the bottom to the top<br />We're sparking wild fire<br />Never quit and never stop<br />The rest of our lives<br />From the bottom to the top<br />We're sparking wild fire<br />Never quit and never stop<br />It's not until you fall that you fly<br />When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable<br />Take a shot, chase the sun<br />Fnd the beautiful<br />We will glow in the dark<br />Turning dust to gold<br />And we'll dream<br />It possible<br />Possible<br />Possible<br />And we'll dream<br />It possible<br />Source: Musixmatch<br />Songwriters: Andy Love{% endraw %}
