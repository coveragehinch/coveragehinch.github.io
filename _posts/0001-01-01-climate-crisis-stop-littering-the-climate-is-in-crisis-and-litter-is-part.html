{% raw %}The climate is in crisis and litter is part of the problem – harmful waste such as chemicals and plastics are spread on the ground and in lakes and seas. <br /><br />If we don’t do anything about it, our oceans could end up containing more plastic than fish by the year 2050! But you and other children and young people around the world can make a difference and become the No Litter Generation. Watch and share this animated video to be inspired for change!<br /><br />Climate Action and No Litter Generation is an initiative from the World’s Children’s Prize (WCP) and Håll Sverige Rent (Keep Sweden Tidy). with support from the Swedish Postcode Lottery.{% endraw %}
