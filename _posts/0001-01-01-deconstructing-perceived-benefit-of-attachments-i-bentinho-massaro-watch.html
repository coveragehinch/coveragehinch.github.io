Together, they uncover the perceived benefit that she believes is contained in her own self judgment. <br /><br />Once it becomes clear to her that it is nonsensical or of no benefit, she is able to stop using it as a reason to judge herself.<br /><br />————<br />GET INVOLVED:<br /><br />No Limits Society is our growing community which aims to generate “a collective of like-hearted souls trained and activated in the same intention: to awaken, purify and empower themselves in order to ignite global awakening individually and as a society.”<br /> <br />As a No Limits Society member you will have opportunities to put yourself to task, show up in creative ways, involve yourself with the team, step up as a leader, and participate in initiatives you would otherwise never know about. You will also discover Bentinho’s leadership first-hand—not just as a speaker delivering content for an audience to consume—but as a leader with a mission and a team under his wing to purify into a streamlined vehicle of service to all.<br /> <br />You can participate as a quiet observer, but we feel very confident than even the shyest of the self-identified introverts amongst you will, after several weeks, begin to feel at home and safe to open up, share, contribute and feel empowered in your connection to the rising vibrations of this society as a whole.<br /> <br />Find out more and sign up here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.civilizationupgraders.com/society">https://www.civilizationupgraders.com/society</a><br /><br />————<br />Join Bentinho Massaro's free online Forum, where spiritual seekers go to meet and discuss the teachings further: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/forum">https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/forum</a><br />-----------<br />About Bentinho Massaro:<br /><br />Bentinho’s teachings contain the essence of all major spiritual paths, but zero in on what works and ignore what does not.
