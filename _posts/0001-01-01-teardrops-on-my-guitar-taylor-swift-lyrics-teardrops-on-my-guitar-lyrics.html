{% raw %}Teardrops On My Guitar lyrics<br />Songwriters: Rose, Liz; Swift, Taylor Alison;<br /><br />Drew looks at me<br />I fake a smile so he won't see<br />What I want and I need<br />And everything that we should be<br /><br />I'll bet she's beautiful<br />That girl he talks about<br />And she's got everything<br />That I have to live without<br /><br />Drew talks to me<br />I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny<br />I can't even see<br />Anyone when he's with me<br /><br />He says he's so in love<br />He's finally got it right<br />I wonder if he knows<br />He's all I think about at night<br /><br />He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<br />The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star<br />He's the song in the car I keep singing<br />Don't know why I do<br /><br />Drew walks by me<br />Can he tell that I can't breathe?<br />And there he goes, so perfectly<br />The kind of flawless I wish I could be<br /><br />She better hold him tight<br />Give him all her love<br />Look in those beautiful eyes<br />And know she's lucky 'cause<br /><br />He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<br />The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star<br />He's the song in the car I keep singing<br />Don't know why I do<br /><br />So I drive home alone<br />As I turn out the light<br />I'll put his picture down<br />And maybe get some sleep tonight<br /><br />'Cuz he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<br />The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart<br />He's the song in the car I keep singing<br />Don't know why I do<br /><br />He's the time taken up but there's never enough<br />And he's all that I need to fall into<br />Drew looks at me<br />I fake a smile so he won't see{% endraw %}
