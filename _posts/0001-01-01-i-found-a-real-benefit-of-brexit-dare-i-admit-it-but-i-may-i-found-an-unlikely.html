{% raw %}Dare I admit it but I may I found an unlikely Brexit BENEFIT… so for a change here we go. I Found A Real BENEFIT OF BREXIT:<br />Considering the pressure put on the haulage industry… I admit the British supermarkets have done very well… although at a higher cost for which they have absorbed…. Even, if they have resulted in paying bribes and higher wages for the HGV lorry drivers, chartering ships and airfreight…And I have talked about the shortage of HGV lorry drivers before…on many occasions and how Brexit Xenophobia shut out experienced lorry drivers from EU member states…This contributed to the shortage of more than 100,000 HGV drivers…The average gross hourly pay was up by a modest 7.8% …<br />So what is the unplanned Brexit benefit?... well the winner is the environment since supermarkets and other large stores are changing their logistics model and turning to rail Freight… so yes the privatised rail is benefitting too… I know we will still have a shortage of HGV lorry drivers but fewer lorries on the roads have to be a good thing… relieving some pressure for all road users and less time sitting in traffic jams and pumping particulates… “every train takes 60 HGVs off the road” for the long UK haul freeing them up for the short hauls…<br />But there is a but: The Road haulage industry isn’t happy anymore…They saw their industry offering higher wages and HGV drivers all of sudden were gaining some respect… But Karma has played its hand and Brexit has shafted them after they put the cross in the wrong box…and their job market has been seriously diluted by the rail freight… And it is rapidly expanding taking away long-distance haulage from the HGV drivers but leaving multiple short-distance trips from the rail terminals…this will inevitably multiply loading and unloading stops mounting to less time behind the wheel… and possibly longer days….<br />Elizabeth de Jong, Logistics UK policy director, said the segment had shown “incredible” flexibility and resilience in dealing with Brexit, considering the reduced size of its workforce.<br />However, she added: “…in order to retain staff and attract new drivers, smaller fleet operators are still not back to full fleet capacity after their inability to compete for drivers by offering higher wages appears to be hindering their efforts to recruit new staff.”...<br />Tesco is shipping 65,000 containers by rail and wants to increase this to 90,000 in the next few months and Dunelm recently announced a new warehouse at Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal... The facility will employ another 4,000 people in January ...<br />“Europe’s largest Farage Garage”, with space for 650 HGVs, just opened in Ashford, Kent, “ But will there be enough HGV’s to fill it… I have my doubts if I was to consider Rail Freight…but if the UK does actually implement the checks on imports in January 2022 as promised…oh my giddy aunt the proverbial shit is going to hit the fan…and expect bottlenecks in both directions…<br />You tell me please leave it in the comments down below….<br /><br />Please Check out our other Videos as YouTube does not always send out NOTIFICATIONS<br /><br />SUPPORT US HERE:<br />BUY ME A COFFEE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/allshorts">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/allshorts</a><br />PATREON <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/allshorts">https://www.patreon.com/allshorts</a><br /><br />With your support, I won't add mid-roll adverts<br /><br />SUPPORT US HERE:<br />BUY ME A COFFEE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/allshorts">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/allshorts</a><br />PATREON <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/allshorts">https://www.patreon.com/allshorts</a><br /><br />Follow us Here:<br />TicTok <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@allshortsexposed">https://www.tiktok.com/@allshortsexposed</a> @allshortsexposed<br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/wallybois">https://twitter.com/wallybois</a><br />Wallybois Woodworking Channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/WallyboisWoodworking">https://www.youtube.com/c/WallyboisWoodworking</a><br />Wallybois Woodworking Site <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wallybois.com/">https://www.wallybois.com/</a><br />Website will all videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.allshorts.eu/">https://www.allshorts.eu/</a> <br /><br />COOL T-SHIRTS and other  Merchandise on Teespring<br />GO BACK.
