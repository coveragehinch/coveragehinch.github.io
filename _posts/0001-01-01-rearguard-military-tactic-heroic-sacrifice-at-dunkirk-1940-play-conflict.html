In essence, rearguard units are standard military units, most often infantry, but with a specific task. <br />Rearguard units were formed when a military formation was forced to evacuate its troops or to withdraw from the battlefield, very often under strong pressure made by enemy forces. In these cases the withdrawing main body of the formation would not be capable of fighting back. Quite opposite, it was very vulnerable to enemy attacks and in great danger of being destroyed. <br /><br /><br />Become a Simple History member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/simplehistory/join">https://www.youtube.com/simplehistory/join</a><br />Support us on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/simplehistory">https://www.patreon.com/simplehistory</a><br /><br />Copyright: DO NOT translate and re-upload our content on Youtube or other social media.<br /><br />SIMPLE HISTORY MERCHANDISE <br /><br />Get the Simple History books on Amazon: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner-%60/e/B00H5TYLAE/">https://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner-%60/e/B00H5TYLAE/</a><br /><br />T-Shirts<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/simple-history-official-merch">https://teespring.com/stores/simple-history-official-merch</a><br /><br />Simple history gives you the facts, simple!<br /><br />See the book collection here:<br /><br />Amazon USA<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/">http://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/</a><br /><br /><br />Amazon UK<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/</a><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Simple-History-549437675141192/">https://www.facebook.com/Simple-History-549437675141192/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SimpleHistoryYT">https://twitter.com/SimpleHistoryYT</a><br /><br /><br />Credit:<br />Created by Daniel Turner (B.A. (Hons) in History, University College London) <br />Script: Dejan Milivojevic<br />Narrator:<br /><br />Chris Kane<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vocalforge.com/">https://vocalforge.com/</a><br /><br />Sources:<br />Dildy, Douglas C., and Howard Gerrard.
