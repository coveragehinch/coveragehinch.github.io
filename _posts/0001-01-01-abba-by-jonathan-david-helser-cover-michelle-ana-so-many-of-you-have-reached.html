{% raw %}So many of you have reached out to me, sharing how this song has impacted your lives. This was the song that the Lord sat on my heart the night before my husband passed away and I had no idea why I couldn't stop singing it. The next day I understood why. Abba needed to let me know that no matter what the pain looked like, he was more real than I could possibly imagine. <br /><br />Days later, I sang this very song at the celebration of life for Curtis. <br /><br />Many thanks to Jonathan David Helser for allowing God to use you through this song. The very words of this song have moved me to further understand God's love for me. Praying for God's eternal favor over you, your ministry and your marriage. Forever, I thank you. <br /><br />Special thanks to Israel Fuica (guitarist) and his wife, Janelle, for letting me use their house!! Love you guys. As well as JP and Micheal Grajales for all of the production and editing! Thanks guys!<br /><br />LINK FOR #LMAil EMAIL LIST:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fierce--5595.ck.page/f4dfed5c19">https://fierce--5595.ck.page/f4dfed5c19</a><br /><br />www.loveMichelleAna.com<br /><br />Instagram:<br />www.instagram.com/loveMichelleAna<br /><br />Twitter:<br />www.twitter.com/loveMichelleAna<br /><br />Facebook:<br />www.facebook.com/loveMichelleAna<br /><br /><br />******For Serious Business Inquiries******<br />          Michelle@loveMichelleAna.com{% endraw %}
