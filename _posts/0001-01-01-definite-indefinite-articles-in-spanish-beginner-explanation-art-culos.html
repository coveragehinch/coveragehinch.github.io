{% raw %}Back to basics! How and when to use definite articles (el, la, los, las) and indefinite articles (un, una, unos, unas). This animated explanation is a basic lesson for beginners: it starts with what articles are in English and then explains how to use them in Spanish. It includes the exception for feminine nouns that begin with a stressed &quot;ah&quot; sound.<br /><br />How do you know when a noun is masculine or feminine? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/PADpJ3rcwa4?t=71">https://youtu.be/PADpJ3rcwa4?t=71</a><br /><br />Image credits: pch.vector, iconicbestiary, freepik, pikisuperstar<br />Music credit: Sunny, bensound.com<br /><br />I am a public school teacher who makes these labor-intensive videos in my spare time.
