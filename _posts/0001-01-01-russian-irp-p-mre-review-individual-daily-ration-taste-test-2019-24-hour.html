{% raw %}I'm generally a fan of Russian Military Rations but taste testing this 2019 24-Hour IRP-P was a little disappointing. Unlike MREs Russian rations aren't built to last so not everything was exactly fresh. A large portion of the calories in this ration pack come from crackers and the crackers were definitely showing their age. They had  an unpleasant stale crunch and a rancid oil taste. The mains were just fine, even quite good, but this menu wasn't as filling as expected, even though it contained a substantial 3500 calories. I'm sure it would get a soldier through the day just fine but I hope they are issued to troops  when they are a bit more fresh. <br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Thanks <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.mreinfo.com">http://www.mreinfo.com</a><br /><br />Follow me on Social Media:<br />Facebook- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Readinessreviews/">https://www.facebook.com/Readinessreviews/</a><br />Instagram- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/readinessreviews/">https://www.instagram.com/readinessreviews/</a><br /><br />Contact me via Email - ReadinessReviews@gmail.com<br /><br />#ReadinessReviews<br />#MRE<br />#Russian<br /><br />Russian IRP-P MRE Review  Individual Daily Ration TASTE TEST | 2019 Military Meal Ready to Eat{% endraw %}
