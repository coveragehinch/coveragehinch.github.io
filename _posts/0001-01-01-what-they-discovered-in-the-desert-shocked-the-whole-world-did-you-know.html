{% raw %}Did you know, 20% percent of the world’s land surface is desert? It’s no secret that the desert is characterized by a lack of rainfall, often receiving fewer than ten inches of rain per year. There’s pretty much only dry soil, and little to no surface water. It’s so parched that rain evaporates before it reaches the ground. But that doesn’t mean that there’s nothing amazing waiting to be discovered there. From natural to extraterrestrial, accidental to on-purpose - all 100% percent unbelievable... You better grab a glass of water! 15 Strangest Things Found in the Desert<br /><br />For Copyright Issues, Please Feel Free to E-mail me: <br />TSindustries32@hotmail.com{% endraw %}
