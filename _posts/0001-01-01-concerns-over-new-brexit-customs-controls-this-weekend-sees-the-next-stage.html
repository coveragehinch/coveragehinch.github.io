{% raw %}This weekend sees the next stage of brexit trade barriers erected, including customs controls. The practical upshot is not just further difficulty in trading between Britain and most of the rest of Europe, but that the systems needed have not been tested out by those who need to use them. The potential for delays and failings in the system is enormous and is likely to lead to more business angst in the new year.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias">https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76">https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76</a><br />FT article (paywall): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/eabd3113-c669-4792-95cf-b5ad0ea6da3b">https://www.ft.com/content/eabd3113-c669-4792-95cf-b5ad0ea6da3b</a>{% endraw %}
