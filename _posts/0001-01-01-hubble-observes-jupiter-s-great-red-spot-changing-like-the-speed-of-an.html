{% raw %}Like the speed of an advancing race car driver, the winds in the outermost “lane” of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot are accelerating – a discovery only made possible by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, which has monitored the planet for more than a decade. <br /><br />Researchers analyzing Hubble’s regular “storm reports” found that the average wind speed just within the boundaries of the storm, known as a high-speed ring, has increased by up to 8% from 2009 to 2020. In contrast, the winds near the red spot’s innermost region are moving significantly more slowly, like someone cruising lazily on a sunny Sunday afternoon.<br /> <br />For more information, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nasa.gov/hubble.">https://nasa.gov/hubble.</a> <br /><br />Video credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center <br />Paul Morris: Lead Producer <br /><br />Music: <br />&quot;Underneath the same Moon&quot; by JC Lemay [SACEM] via Koka Media [SACEM], Universal Production Music France [SACEM], and Universal Production Music.<br /><br />This video can be freely shared and downloaded at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13939.">https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13939.</a> While the video in its entirety can be shared without permission, individual imagery provided by ESA (the European Space Agency) is obtained through permission.
