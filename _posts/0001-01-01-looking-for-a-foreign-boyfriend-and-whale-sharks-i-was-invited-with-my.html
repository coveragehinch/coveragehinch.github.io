{% raw %}I was invited with my friend Nico to go with his girlfriend and friends looking for whale sharks.  It was a wonderful invite and a great time which was also encouraging to see Domestic Tourism return to our area.  Special thanks to the JD Hotel and boat crew.  Contact the hotel if you are interested in a trip like this!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/jdbeachfronthotel/">https://www.facebook.com/jdbeachfronthotel/</a>{% endraw %}
