{% raw %}After a day off from shooting the new season of Shark Tank, I join my friend &amp; fellow watch collector Teddy Baldassarre as we visit the only place I'd prefer to be on a day off in L.A. <br /><br />We head over to F.P. Journe and spend the day viewing some incredible pieces. Stop the madness!{% endraw %}
