{% raw %}Growing up on camera for the entire world to see and love means a whole lot of embarrassing moments were captured that may sometimes come back to haunt the actors! There is plenty of footage to check out that we adore but the performers find awfully cringey - going all the way back to Daniel Radcliffe’s screen test. <br />When their performances had to be a little spicier and really indulging in the teenage years, Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint all found themselves in very awkward scenarios when it came to time lock lips with each other. As if the fact that they were like a trio of siblings didn’t make it awkward enough, a couple of them had to really dive in and get far too close for comfort for the cameras! <br />Rupert’s biggest downfall throughout the series might just be the fact that he laughed at pretty well anything and everything, causing a lot of delays and in turn, a decade worth of embarrassment and he struggled to get words out. Young Tom Felton was pretty traumatized in his early days when he struggled to get his lines out properly. All eyes were on him and the pressure was on, but unfortunately, the actor just couldn’t perform so his lines got scrapped! <br />Some adjacent embarrassment came when there were some not-so-well behaved monkeys on set that started carrying out their private business in the middle of scenes, making the teenage performers super uncomfortable - one bat also wound up getting too comfortable with Grint. <br />No matter the reason, looking back gives the performers from Harry Potter plenty of opportunities to cringe, but we’re here for it! <br /><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things</a><br /><br /><br />Chapters:<br /><br />00:00 Intro <br />00:24 Awkward Hugs<br />01:08 Messy Monkeys<br />01:46 Sleeping on the Job<br />02:11 Losing Lines<br />02:47 Tripped Up<br />03:52 Kisses Disturbed by Laughter<br />04:02 Sibling-Like Kisses<br />04:46 Professor Pranks<br />05:36 Watch Your Wand<br />06:19 A Step Behind<br />06:47 A Confusing Choice<br />07:11 Misunderstood Aggression<br />07:46 Bad Timing<br />08:11 Cringey Throwback<br />08:33 Early Days<br /><br /><br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/">https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/</a><br /><br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thethings.com">https://www.thethings.com</a><br /><br />Written by: Thalia GK<br />Narrated by: Serena L<br />Edited by: V.Serhii<br /><br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
