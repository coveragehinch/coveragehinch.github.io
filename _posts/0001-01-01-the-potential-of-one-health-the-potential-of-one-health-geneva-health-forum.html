{% raw %}The potential of one health - Geneva Health Forum 2014 - Dr Jacob Zinsstag - Head Human and Animal Health Swiss TPH - Switzerland <br /><br />Since its founding in 1943, the Swiss Tropical Institute (STI), now Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) has become a world-renowned Institution for teaching, research and services in the field of International Health Development.<br /> <br />The multi- and cross-disciplinary activities and experience of scientific laboratory studies, conceptual clinical work and practical transfer of technical expertise to health system planning and programmes in local, national and partner countries are the building blocks of our success.<br /> <br />In June 2009 the Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine of the University of Basel, internationally recognized in the areas of environmental epidemiology and women’s health, was integrated into the STI. With the beginning of the year 2010, the physical integration of our offices took place, and the whole Institute has publicly taken on its new name, the “Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute”, also to be known as the “Swiss TPH”.<br /> <br />Today over 500 colleagues from 40 nations work worldwide for the Swiss TPH in research, teaching and service provision with the single goal to facilitate and contribute to health development worldwide with a strong focus on low and middle income countries. We are determined to improve public health, strengthen health systems and reduce poverty through partnerships, mutual learning, contribution and achievement.<br /><br />As an associate institute of the University of Basel, the Swiss TPH takes part in teaching within the medical, philosophy, natural sciences, and historical philosophy faculties, as well as is engaged in post-graduate education and advanced training on national and international levels.<br /> <br />The Swiss TPH is a public organisation of the Basel-City region receiving 19% of its core budget from Basel-City and Basel-Land (12%) and the Swiss federal government (7%). The remaining contributions (81%) are received through competitive fundraising and the earnings of our service departments - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.swisstph.ch/">http://www.swisstph.ch/</a>{% endraw %}
