{% raw %}Finally we are diving into the vizards from BLEACH starting with their leader Shinji Hirako, a former captain of the Gotei 13 who was exiled from the Soul Soceity during the Turn Back the Pendulum arc. In this video I analyse the past of Shinji, going over his first chronological appearance within the story all the way up until the latest chapter of Bleach. Shinji was the former captain of the 5th division, his leuitenant was none other than Sosuke Aizen, which means that his character shares a significant history with Aizen, I explain their relationship in this video including the role that Shinji plays within the story!<br /><br />Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DBZimran">https://www.patreon.com/DBZimran</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DBZimran">https://twitter.com/DBZimran</a><br /> <br />#BLEACH #BLEACH2022 #BleachAnime{% endraw %}
