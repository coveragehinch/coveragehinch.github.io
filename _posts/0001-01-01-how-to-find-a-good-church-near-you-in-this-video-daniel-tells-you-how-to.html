Do you know what to look out for when searching for a church in your area?  You might be wondering how to find a biblical church, or you might even think to yourself 'Are all churches the same?' Finding a good church can be a difficult task if you do not allow the Holy Spirit to lead you. Finding the right church is very important because stirring up one another to love and good works is necessary for our own spiritual growth.<br />Hebrews 10:24 &quot;And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.&quot; <br />As important as it is for Christians to meet together, it is equally important to test everything that we hear in a church against the Word of God. <br />If you want to know more about the criteria of a good church, and how to find a good church near you, then watch the full to find out.<br /><br />If you watched the whole video and liked it, then<br />LIKE, SUBSCRIBE AND SHARE MY CHANNEL{% endraw %}
