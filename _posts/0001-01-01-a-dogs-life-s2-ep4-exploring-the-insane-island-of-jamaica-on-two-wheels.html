{% raw %}A Dogslife Episode 4 Season Finale! We definitely went a big more exotic this time and headed out to Jamaica! The birth of Reggae music, with incredible beaches, epic rainforests and the Caribbean Sea which I can confirm is the perfect temperature too swim in. We know it's got everything above, but Jamaica also has mountains and as you'll find out some really fun mountain biking too!<br /><br /> Any Dogslife Episode I needed a great crew so we headed out with Steve peat and @Olly Wilkins  to explore the hills, drink coconut rum,  and eat some mega tasty food! <br /><br />We started near Ochos Rios we're we ended up on a variety of trails and even ended at Blacksands beach. The second part of our trip we headed to the Blue mountains just above Kingston to ride some epic trails and check out a bit of Kingston.<br /><br />Huge thanks to our guides Bushdog and Anthony who were part of Singletrack Jamaica, they were such fun to hang out with all week and gave us a taste of the real Jamaica! <br /><br />That's it for season 2, big thanks to all guys for watching and commenting, it means a lot! <br />Big thanks to our Sponsors @SCOTT Sports  &amp; @Monster Energy we couldn't of done it without you....<br /><br />(Also giving away some free DMR Deathgrips for you guys on YouTube, so comment below and let us know your favourite colour and I'll pick someone from the comments!!){% endraw %}
