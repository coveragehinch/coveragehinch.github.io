{% raw %}Should robots always follow human orders? Or should they be allowed to reject them in some cases, e.g., when they are not safe? The answer is that robots must be able to disobey in order to obey.<br /><br />Matthias Scheutz is a Professor in Cognitive and Computer Science in the Department of Computer Science, Director of the Human-Robot Interaction Laboratory and Bernard M. Gordon Senior Faculty Fellow in the School of Engineering at Tufts University. He has over 300 peer-reviewed publications in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, cognitive modeling, robotics, and human-robot interaction. His current research focuses on complex autonomous robots with moral competence that can be tasked in natural language. Matthias Scheutz is a professor of cognitive and computer science, and director of the Human-Robot Interaction Laboratory at Tufts University. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
