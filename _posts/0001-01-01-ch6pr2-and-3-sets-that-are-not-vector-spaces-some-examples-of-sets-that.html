{% raw %}Some examples of sets that are not vector spaces because they fail to satisfy the vector space axioms. The first example is shown to be not closed under scalar multiplication; and the second example is shown to be not closed under addition. This is Chapter 6 Problems 2 and 3 from the MATH1231/1241 Algebra notes. Presented by Joshua Capel from the UNSW School of Mathematics and Statisitcs.{% endraw %}
