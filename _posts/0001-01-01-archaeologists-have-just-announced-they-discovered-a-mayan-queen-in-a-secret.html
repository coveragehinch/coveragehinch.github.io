{% raw %}Archaeologists have just announced they discovered a Mayan Queen in a secret underground tunnel. Today, we take a look at what these archaeologists discovered.<br /><br />Even after centuries of consistent research, most of earthâ€™s history remains a mystery. Archaeologists, historians, scientists, and others all try to give us answers to the questions of the universe, but there are still ones that no one can answer. Of course, despite the mysteries, discoveries have been made. These discoveries tell us more about our history, our past, and even our own lives; but sometimes, they leave us even more clueless than before.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Thank you to CO.AG for the background music!{% endraw %}
