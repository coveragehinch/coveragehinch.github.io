{% raw %}How to Visualize $100,000 Coming Into Your Life Counting Out The Benjamins<br />Do you need an extra $100,000 for a one time purchase or a monthly increase?  Do you need to have an extra $100,000 a week?<br />Do you need an extra $100,000 a day?   Or do you need an extra $100,000 per hour? <br />I know four consultants who earned $100,000 per month and they mentored me in the years 1996-2000.  I paid them a LOT of money to teach me this.  I know one man who earns $100,000 per hour.  Andâ€¦ I have paid him a LOT of money to teach me and train me how to be better at what I do.  <br /><br />Pick up One Thousand:  one-dollar bills and hold them in your hand.  <br />WATCH the screen, do not look at your hands, look at the screen, and count with me.<br /><br />One hundred....Two Hundred.... Three Hundred........<br />Feel the paper in your hands as you count, watch the screen, and imagine you have One Thousand: One-Hundred Dollar bills in your hand that you are counting.<br /><br />Do this exercise every morning and every night with me.  <br />You can &quot;Right Click&quot; on the video and choose to &quot;LOOP&quot; the video so you can watch it over and over for a half-hour right before you go to bed and when you first wake up in the morning.  You could run it over and over while you sleep so it could sink in while you dream. <br /><br />Watch the video over and over by right-clicking and choosing the &quot;Loop&quot; option.  <br /><br />If you need a different amount look at my money counting video playlist for the exact amount you need and use that video.  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZOok4LwoTmiMwRXya9JSfTfR3SrIgiQO">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZOok4LwoTmiMwRXya9JSfTfR3SrIgiQO</a><br />If that amount is not in the list of videos let me know in the comments and I will work to get that video for you.  If you need a different currency let me know about that too.    Feel it and believe it..<br /><br />For this to work you need to.... <br />           Make a list of what you will do with the extra money and <br />           Write down what you are willing to do to get the money.<br />           Put those things on a 3 x 5 card and carry it with you all day long<br />           PRAY never-ceasing about this and ask for inspiration on how to do it<br />           Watch this video daily<br />WRITE IT DOWN.<br /><br />Write down your goal, why you need it, what you will do with it, and how you are going to get it. <br /><br />Come up with a plan that you can believe.<br />Most people can only really believe an increase of 10% over what you are already earning or repeating your best month ever.   <br />Some people have had so many challenges that even asking them to believe they can earn 10% than they are wearing is too much.  <br />If you are one of those people you need to look at your &quot;Best Month Ever&quot; and realize the time in your life that you earned the MOST Money you have ever earned and embrace that memory.  Remember when you actually held that money in your hand and had that kind of money go into the bank or at least through your fingers.  It is best if you have actually held that amount of money in your hand at least once.  <br /><br />Changing the frequency of how often you have held the money is easy.  So if you have only ever held $500 in your hands, you may want to imagine you are earning that over and over...  weekly or daily.  <br /><br />Experiment with it.  <br />Let me know how it is going in the comments.  <br />Let me know if you are interested in doing a live stream with me. <br />Have a great day.<br /><br />#MontyKReed   #GetSTARTED   #GetSTARTEDdontquit <br />#CountingOutTheBenjamins<br />www.MagicMontyReed.com          be entertained<br />www.GetSTARTED-dontquit.com  be motivated<br />www.FoodLife.ThriveLife.com       Emergency Food Supply   (Start a business for $100 )<br />www.MontyKReed.com                   Consulting: Personal and Business Starting at $5000{% endraw %}
