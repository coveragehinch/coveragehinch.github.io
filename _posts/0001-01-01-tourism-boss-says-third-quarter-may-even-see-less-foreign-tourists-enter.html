{% raw %}National governments worldwide are increasingly restricting foreign travel on both inbound and outward flights, to control the virus as they administer vaccination programmes. These bans, such as the recent one in the UK, may even impact the small number of foreign tourists still arriving in the kingdom. Thailandâ€™s vaccination campaign, although it has begun, is only really expected to gain momentum from June as the government plans to inoculate 54% of adults by the end of the year with 63 million doses, mostly of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Even as Dr Yong Poovorawan of Chulalongkorn University says this is not enough, there are also question marks over what it will take and when will it be possible to allow foreign tourists unhindered access again without quarantine.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thaiexaminer.com/thai-news-foreigners/2021/03/08/tourism-boss-says-third-quarter-less-foreign-tourists-than-in-january/">https://www.thaiexaminer.com/thai-news-foreigners/2021/03/08/tourism-boss-says-third-quarter-less-foreign-tourists-than-in-january/</a><br /><br />Joseph O' Connor reports from Bangkok.{% endraw %}
