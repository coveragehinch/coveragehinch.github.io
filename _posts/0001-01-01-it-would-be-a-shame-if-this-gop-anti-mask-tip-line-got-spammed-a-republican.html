In a very creepy fashion he set up an email address illegal mandates at ago.mo.gov and he's blasting this on his Twitter handle among all other pl among other places. There are a lot of vulnerable people in our family that need protection and it feels like Schmidt, who is running against the McCloskey goon for our gerrymandered senate opening, doesn't mind violating my kids' privacy or safety to climb the ladder of the political moment. I don't know who's back in the office checking that email address for what could be pictures of my kid without my consent but wouldn't it be just a shame if a bunch of people spams that email address for unintended purposes? a damn shame indeed. that is true let me repeat that email address here illegal mandates at a g o standing for ag offices I believe dot mo missouri.gov illegal mandates at ago.mo.gov.{% endraw %}
