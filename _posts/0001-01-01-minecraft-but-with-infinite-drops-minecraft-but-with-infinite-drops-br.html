{% raw %}Minecraft, But With Infinite Drops...<br /><br />ðŸš© NEW CHANNEL! @Bionic Reacts <br /><br />In today's Minecraft Challenge... We made it so I can drop any item infinitely! With infinite drops, we can also throw items like a Diamond Sword, Diamond Pickaxe, and more! Challenges will appear that we need to complete, making it harder to survive with Infinite Drops! Completing challenges gives us new custom OP items like an Infinite Sword, Infinite Pickaxe, and even Infinite TNT! These items give us custom OP abilities. Will we survive?
