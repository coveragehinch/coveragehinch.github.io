Saying Sorry in Leadership and understanding Why is it Important to Say Sorry as a Leader!<br /><br />In which circumstances you should say sorry despite your leadership role?<br />It may affect your:<br /><br />- Colleagues <br />- Direct reports<br />- Boss<br />- Team/Stuff<br />- Suppliers/Contractors<br />- Clients<br />- Service Providers<br />- Shareholders<br /><br />Whatever leadership role you are in there is a space and a place for apologising in leadership.<br /><br />For me, saying sorry as a leader, links to something that I spoke about in a previous leadership training video – integrity! <br /><br />Being integral means, whatever circumstance you are in if you have made a mistake you should say sorry no matter your leadership role. How you do this is a personal judgement that you should make in line with how you run your team, department and what corporate environment you are in. <br /><br />However, the key objective as a leader is to RARELY say sorry! Or to rarely have to say sorry! And this is not because you are better than everyone else, no. It is because you are in a leadership position, so you have this role where you have the best leadership skills and therefore should be making very few mistakes.<br /><br />But ok, you have made a mistake, so why is it important to say sorry as a leader? Here are just few examples for you:<br /><br />- It is about showing that you are human<br />- Showing that you care<br />- It allows you to gain respect<br />- Shows your emotional intelligence <br /><br />I invite you to take all these areas into account. <br /><br />Minimize the number of mistakes that you make in order for sorry to be something that comes out of your mouth. However, if you have made a mistake you should say sorry! <br /><br />And sometimes it may not even be your fault. It may be somebody else’s fault – you team, your company, your department may cause a problem with a client, shareholder, another board member, whatever it happens to be – you should take the responsibility as part of your role to apologising in leadership on behalf of whoever caused the problem.<br /><br />If the video has resonated with you, please “like”, “share”, “subscribe” and “comment” on what you have found beneficial.<br /><br />And if you are serious about becoming a successful leader, visit now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.IgweInternational.com">https://www.IgweInternational.com</a> and contact me at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.IgweInternational.com/waitinglist">https://www.IgweInternational.com/waitinglist</a><br /><br />To watch this video again, click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/blpCRwRZDfY">https://youtu.be/blpCRwRZDfY</a>{% endraw %}
