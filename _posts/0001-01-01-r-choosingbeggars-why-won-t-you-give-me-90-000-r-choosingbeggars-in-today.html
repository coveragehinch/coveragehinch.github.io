{% raw %}r/Choosingbeggars In today's episode, a choosing beggar wants a door company to hand over $90,000 in free product for &quot;exposure.&quot; Yes, you read that correctly: $90,000 in free product. She thinks that installing the doors on her horse barn will help the company make money by exposing the product to other people. She also tried to argue that the doors should only be worth $10,000, so she should get an $80,000 discount.
