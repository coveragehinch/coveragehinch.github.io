The first step of blending is when your child states the correct sounds for the letter characters that are being blended for example the word, &quot;Cat&quot; will often first be read as &quot;C&quot;- &quot;at.&quot;  With practice your child will learn to further blend the sounds to correctly say &quot;Cat.&quot;<br />Your child will learn to read 3 letter Short Vowel A words in the Practice Reading Book.
