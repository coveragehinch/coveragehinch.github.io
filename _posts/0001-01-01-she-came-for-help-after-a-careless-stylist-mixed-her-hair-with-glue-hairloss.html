{% raw %}#hairloss #blackwoman #naturalhair <br /><br />This beauty is 33 years young and haven’t seen her real hair in well over a decade 🤦🏽‍♀️ she wore extensions on top of extensions each time killing her hair follicles.<br /><br />If u look closely u will see she has a hair full of glue. She mentioned a licensed stylist braided down her hair put a stocking cap on and glued the hair down so literally she had glue and braids mixed together 🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️ no paper wraps, no gel, no morning glory no nothing🙏🏽 So many of u are losing your crowns because of lack of education.<br /><br />Words by: <br />Client 01 and 02:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/theofficialrazorchic">https://instagram.com/theofficialrazorchic</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/razorchicofatlantasalon">https://instagram.com/razorchicofatlantasalon</a><br />APPOINTMENT CALL 404-934-5738 Atlanta ga.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://razorchic.com/">https://razorchic.com/</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />Client 03 and 04:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/thastylist18">https://instagram.com/thastylist18</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/Reggiegraham">https://linktr.ee/Reggiegraham</a><br />24551 katy fwy, Katy Tx 77494, Houston, Texas 77063{% endraw %}
