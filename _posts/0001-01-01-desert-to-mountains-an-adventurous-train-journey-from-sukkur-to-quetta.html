{% raw %}Traveling to Quetta on train is always an adventurous experience. Specially the journey between Sibi and Quetta is full of surprises. You encounter 17 tunnels en route between barren mountains. Traversing the Bolan Valley, it is an amazing experience which any rail lover would love to feel. <br />In this journey I am traveling from Sukkur to Quetta on Balochistan's most famous train, Jaffar Express. Jaffar Express is longest route train of Pakistan that runs between Peshawar and Quetta. So sit back, relax and enjoy this journey :)<br /><br />Many people have asked to support my journeys..
