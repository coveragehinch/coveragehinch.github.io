{% raw %}When there are so many buyers going after very few houses on the market, it is hard to make an offer that stands out from the rest. A trick to do this is by asking the seller for an inspection for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This gives the peace of mind to the seller that you won't require repairs or extra cash before the sale and ultimately net them more money at the end of the day. Home inspections for informational purposes only are very trendy right now, and it is great for sellers, and still can be great for buyers to know what they are buying or if it's worth buying.<br />There are plenty of more helpful tips buying or selling a home on my NEW website <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bubbahutchison.com/">https://bubbahutchison.com/</a>{% endraw %}
