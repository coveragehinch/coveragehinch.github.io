{% raw %}A seven day vacation or 5 weeks of travel - which would you prefer? When you're working towards financial independence, vacations are a time to set aside work and everyday chores. But they're constrained by things you don't often control: accrued vacation time, work and school schedules, business obligations, and holidays, to name a few. In this episode,  Eric and Jason compare notes from their two respective sides of FI and their recent vacations: 7 days for Pre-FI Eric and 5 weeks for Post-FI Jason. See just how different is travel once you reach FI and the constraints have been removed.<br /><br />For more information on Jason's five-week trip, check out his blog post on the topic:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thenextphaseisnow.com/longest-vacation-of-my-life/">https://thenextphaseisnow.com/longest-vacation-of-my-life/</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00 Introduction + our trips: 7 days (Eric) vs. 35 days (Jason)<br />02:18 How do we schedule trips, pre- and post-FI?<br />06:07 Trip planning + how we organize our time<br />11:34 &quot;Vacation&quot; vs. &quot;Travel&quot; defined<br />14:35 Post-FI travel spending - what's changed?<br />18:54 Side hustle income as a source for other fun travel<br />20:33 The benefits of slow travel vs. cramming it all in<br />23:56 On post-FI trips you can take lazy days, guilt-free!<br />28:27 Did taking a five-week trip change how we feel about long travel?<br />32:45 Post-FI finances + budgeting for the things that matter most to you<br />35:02 Lessons learned from long travel + closing thoughts<br /><br />**Tools, resources + information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twosidesoffi.com">http://twosidesoffi.com</a><br />**Our podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twosidesoffi.com/podcast/">https://twosidesoffi.com/podcast/</a><br /><br />**Eric’s business: 30X40 Design Workshop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thirtybyforty.com">https://thirtybyforty.com</a><br />**Jason's blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thenextphaseisnow.com">https://thenextphaseisnow.com</a><br />**Eric’s YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thirtybyforty.com/youtube">https://thirtybyforty.com/youtube</a><br /><br />#twosidesoffi #financialindependence #firemovement<br /><br />  @30X40 Design Workshop ​{% endraw %}
