{% raw %}Most of us try to ignore tough feelings, by pushing them deep down inside or looking for a distraction that makes us feel temporarily better. When we disconnect from these feelings, we move away from confidence, health, and our desired pursuits, ultimately undermining our ability to fully realize our ambitions.<br /><br />On this week’s mini-episode, Dhru sits down with Dr. Joan Rosenberg, a cutting-edge psychologist, innovative thinker, and trainer. She is a two-time TEDx speaker, and the bestselling author of 90 Seconds to a Life you Love: How to Master Your Difficult Feelings to Cultivate Lasting Confidence, Resilience and Authenticity. <br /><br />Dr. Rosenberg shares the eight most influential feelings that people need to work through if they want to find success. All of them are common, everyday reactions to things not turning out the way we want. Our desire to avoid these feelings leads to unresolved issues; Dr. Rosenberg explains why that is so dangerous and how even just 90 seconds of sitting in discomfort can entirely change our capacity to cope.<br /> <br />Find Dhru’s full-length conversation with Dr. Joan Rosenberg here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lnk.to/DrJoanRosenberg/">https://lnk.to/DrJoanRosenberg/</a><br /> <br />For more on Dhru Purohit, be sure to follow him on Instagram @dhrupurohit, on Facebook @dhruxpurohit, on Twitter @dhrupurohit, and on YouTube @dhrupurohit.

I personally started taking magnesium to help with my sleep, especially when I travel, and it’s been a game changer. But I don’t take just any old magnesium, I take BiOptimizers Magnesium Breakthrough. It contains 7 different forms of magnesium, which all have different functions in the body. I haven’t found anything else like it on the market. Right now, BiOptimizers is offering my community a few special bundles, just head over to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://magbreakthrough.com/dhru,">https://magbreakthrough.com/dhru,</a> with code DHRU10.{% endraw %}
