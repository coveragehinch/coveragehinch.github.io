{% raw %}Playthrough of Mental Omega 3.3.6 Soviet mission #23 - Fatal Impact on Mental Difficulty.<br /><br />Stand by for Volkov-fall.<br /><br />Soviet forces are marching towards Moscov, where Yuri is hiding. The Psychic Amplifier located here remains a threat, and unusual way of destroying it is planned - through effort of Engineers, combined Chinese Tech and Shuttles taken from Epsilon Moon base, we managed to create makeshift payloads - we will use them to destroy the frontal guard and with it the Amplifier. However, it appears that Yuri got his hands on the old Allied Gladius System and retrofitted it to intercept even lesser projectiles. They must be destroyed, and you need to do this with limited time window - Payloads will be deployed from orbiting satellite, and it can remain above Moscov for so long. Time to make haste.<br /><br />This mission is HARD. There are a lot of roadblocks that you need to go through - hopefully you are good at multitasking. My commentary turned absolutely gibberish at some point i guess - sorry about that.<br /><br />Volkov and Chitzkoi will have to immediately go to the West and breach through all enemy forces around + two sets of rocks. He needs to reach the outpost with Grumbles quickly, as there will be a Kirov chasing him. Once he reaches this position, set him on a cliff to intercept enemy attacks and focus on other side. Any paradrop reinforcements you can get - Tank Drop, Terror Drones and Mortar Quads - should be sent to him.<br /><br />Reznov's side has a damaged base. Repair buildings quickly, deploy couple of miners to boost your economy and add more Anti Air units to combat first set of Irkallas to come. Then, boost the frontline and await the arrival of MCV Taskforce with Krukov.<br /><br />And MCV taskforce is one of more important ones - Use the forces to clear the high ground, try to save your T3 tanks and siege units. It's time to build the base. All your tech/T3 buildings should be palced near Refinery area in corner of a map. You will require Atomheart first, then Nuke Silo and Palace, Latin lab is the least important one. There will be 3 sets of Superweapons firing at you - 2 Dominators and one Nuke SIlo that will be rebuilt once in different location. I suggest you try to elliminate the Nuke SIlo first if possible - Either try to breach through with your main taskforce of units or attempt to Nuke it down in conjunction of placing some Support Powers around it. Dominator on the Eastern part of fortress is always fake and can be ignored. You may require to place some of decoy war factories to provide AI with a target to nuke.<br /><br />MCV Base will be usually under attack by set of forces coming from behind, Irkallas and Tyrants - use Wolfhounds for defense and place a group of Cyborgs near the Tech Machinery to intercept attacks from there. You can also use a group of Scuds to take out Hammer defenses on Volkovs path. Once you are ready, cross the bridge and enter the Soviet outpost - it can be depowered by Volkov by destroying the Tech Nuke Reactor and i recommend doing so - and try to wipe out all enemy forces quickly. use engineers to capture some of buildings and use them to reinforce your team. Once the area is clear, create a set of WOlfhounds and 2 Kirovs to clear the area ahead - There will be a mini base with Arty bunker and destroyed bridge.You can remain there for now. Wolfhounds should stay at the ramp where more of enemy forces will be sent at you for interception.<br /><br />Reznov's base should train 18 Bomb Buggies and use them in two strikes to wipe out Spatha system at the South of the area. By that time you should receive Grumbles on this frontline - deploy them to easily intercept all Air forces and Irkallas sent your way. After that, start massing Drakuvs, Stalkers that were captured from it and Cyborgs.<br /><br />Time to move with Volkov. His team and all the Grumbles should head to the starting area and clear it from enemies - Ruiners will be his biggest nightmare, so keep Grumbles alive at all costs. You should meet no bigger opposition until you reach the area between your MCV base and Epsilon Fortress. There will be a lot of long range units, Paradrops and Tyrants coming at you, so if possible try to bring something nearby - a group of Wolfhounds from MCV base could work well. Head to Converter building and finally start playing the mission - Volkov will gain incredible firepower and you will need him to clear all forces on your path. You will need to move 3 groups at once. Volkov and grumbles clear the area from Irkallas and support other 2 lanes. Taskforce from MCV base have to breach through and with help of Iron Curtain and Nuclear Path quickly strike down the Spatha located there.
