{% raw %}It's so easy to tell someone &quot;Love yourself&quot; and much more difficult to describe how to do it. Learn and practice these six steps to gradually start loving yourself more every day:<br /><br />Step 1: Be willing to feel pain and take responsibility for your feelings.<br />Step 1 is mindfully following your breath to become present in your body and embrace all of your feelings. It's about moving toward your feelings rather than running away from them with various forms of self-abandonment, such as staying focused in your head, judging yourself, turning to addictions to numb out, etc. All feelings are informational.<br /><br />Step 2: Move into the intent to learn.<br />Commit to learning about your emotions, even the ones that may be causing you pain so that you can move into taking loving action.<br /><br />Step 3: Learn about your false beliefs.<br />Step 3 is a deep and compassionate process of exploration—of learning about your beliefs and behavior and what is happening with a person or situation that may be causing your pain. Ask your feeling self, your inner child: &quot;What am I thinking or doing that's causing the painful feelings of anxiety, depression, guilt, shame, jealousy, anger, loneliness, or emptiness?&quot; Allow the answer to come from inside, from your intuition and feelings.<br /><br />Once you understand what you're thinking or doing that's causing these feelings, ask your ego about the fears and false beliefs leading to the self-abandoning thoughts and actions.<br /><br />Step 4: Start a dialogue with your higher self.<br />It's not as hard to connect with your higher guidance as you may think. The key is to be open to learning about loving yourself. The answers may come immediately or over time. They may come in words or images or in dreams. When your heart is open to learning, the answers will come.<br /><br />Step 5: Take loving action.<br />Sometimes people think of &quot;loving myself&quot; as a feeling to be conjured up. A good way to look at loving yourself is by emphasizing the action: &quot;What can I do to love myself?&quot; rather than &quot;How can I feel love for myself?&quot;<br /><br />By this point, you've already opened up to your pain, moved into learning, started a dialogue with your feelings, and tapped into your spiritual guidance. Step 5 involves taking one of the loving actions you identified in Step 4. However small they may seem at first, over time these actions add up.<br /><br />Step 6: Evaluate your action and begin again as needed.<br />Once you take the loving action, check in to see if your pain, anger, and shame are getting healed. If not, you go back through the steps until you discover the truth and loving actions that bring you peace, joy, and a deep sense of intrinsic worth.<br /><br />Over time, you will discover that loving yourself improves everything in your life—your relationships, your health and well-being, your ability to manifest your dreams, and your self-esteem. Loving and connecting with yourself is the key to being able to love and connect with others and create loving relationships. Loving yourself is the key to creating a passionate, fulfilled, and joyful life.<br /><br />Musics is by Epidemic Sounds and if you want to use in your own projects, please use this link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/8es4le">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/8es4le</a><br /><br />We're glad you take the time to appreciate our Channel.
