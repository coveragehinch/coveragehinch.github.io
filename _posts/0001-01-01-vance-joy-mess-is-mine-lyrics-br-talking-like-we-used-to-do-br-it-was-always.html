{% raw %}Lyrics:<br />Talking like we used to do<br />It was always me and you<br />Shaken up and shipping out<br />Check me in and check me out<br /><br />Do you like walking in the rain?<br />When you think of love, do you think of pain?<br />You can tell me what you see<br />I will choose what I believe<br /><br />Hold on, darling<br />This body is yours, this body is yours and mine<br />Hold on my darling<br />This mess was yours, now your mess is mine<br /><br />See you in the market place<br />Walking around at 8 am<br />Got two hours before my flight<br />Rub me on my side tonight<br /><br />You're the reason that I feel so strong<br />The reason that I'm hanging on<br />You know you gave me all that time<br />Did I give enough of mine?<br /><br />Hold on, darling<br />This body is yours, this body is yours and mine<br />Hold on, my darling<br />This mess was yours, now your mess is mine<br /><br />Bring me to your house and tell me<br />Sorry for the mess, &quot;Hey, I don't mind&quot;<br />You're talking in your sleep, out of time<br />Well you still make sense to me, your mess is mine<br /><br />Your mess is mine<br />This body is yours and this body is mine<br />Your mess is mine<br />Your mess is mine<br /><br />Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.vancejoy.com/">http://www.vancejoy.com/</a>{% endraw %}
