{% raw %}The James Webb Space Telescope is finally ready for launch on December 18, 2021. A joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency, the James Webb Space Telescope is the most ambitious, complex, and expensive telescope ever built. It is a time machine that will take us back to our origins, observe some of the oldest galaxies in the universe, image new planets forming around other star systems, and even probe the planets of our solar system. In addition, it will shed light on some of the most exciting mysteries of our universe.<br /><br />However, the telescope's journey from being proposed to finally being ready for launch has been quite a roller coaster ride. Every launch requires meticulous planning and preparation. But for Webb, this process began about 25 years ago. <br /><br />Created By: Rishabh Nakra<br />Written By: Simran Buttar<br />Narrated By: Jeffrey Smith{% endraw %}
