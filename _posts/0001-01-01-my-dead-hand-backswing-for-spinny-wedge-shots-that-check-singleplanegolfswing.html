Watch how I use a 'dead-hand' backswing and acceleration through the golf ball for my go-to 35-yard wedge shot that checks up.<br /><br />In this quick golf tip I cover:<br />—Golf wedge play<br />—Golf backswing drill<br />—How to put spin on a golf ball<br />—How to put backspin on your wedges<br />—How to check up a golf shot<br />—Wrist hinge in the golf swing<br />—Why you should clean golf club grooves<br />—How to use the bounce of the golf club<br /><br />The Single Plane golf swing is not a quick fix golf technique. It is a system, beginning at address, that simplifies the most important moment of the golf swing - impact.  <br /><br />Starting at address on two planes where the arms hang straight down at address, the Conventional golf swing is complicated.  Because the arms are hanging straight down, a conventional golfer must lift the body into impact creating stress on the back.  <br /><br />This upward movement to accommodate the two planes is unnecessary.  <br /><br />The Single Plane Golf swing simplifies the golf swing by eliminating the need for the upward movement by starting and impacting on the same plane.<br /><br />To learn more about the Single Plane Golf Swing, order my best selling book here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Single-Plane-Golf-Swing-Better/dp/1612541925/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2Q69Q1VDGBEFD&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+single+plane+golf+swing+book&amp;qid=1633184673&amp;sprefix=the+single+plane+golf+swing%2Caps%2C200&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFaUk8zTVBJRUdXRlQmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA2OTcwNjcyNjFGVFU5VEI3RlhLJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyOTg2ODczU09BSkRMMzFBWE9DJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==">https://www.amazon.com/Single-Plane-Golf-Swing-Better/dp/1612541925/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2Q69Q1VDGBEFD&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+single+plane+golf+swing+book&amp;qid=1633184673&amp;sprefix=the+single+plane+golf+swing%2Caps%2C200&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFaUk8zTVBJRUdXRlQmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA2OTcwNjcyNjFGVFU5VEI3RlhLJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyOTg2ODczU09BSkRMMzFBWE9DJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==</a><br /><br />Transcript:<br />i'm going to talk you through what i consider my favorite wedge shot all right so one of the things that i have been practicing and focusing on in my game has been this 35 yard distance which is kind of my go-to short full shot distance let me explain that just a second but this is kind of where you're in that you want to spin the golf ball everybody wants to spin the ball and stop it but then you get pretty close to the green only 35 yards and you don't know if you should kind of chip it run it up the hill or fly shot in there so i developed a 35-yard go-to spinny little wedge shot i kind of want to walk you through it now one of the things about spinning these shots is that you got to have a clean club face i've talked about this before today the grass is even slightly wet so it's going to kind of inhibit a little bit of the spin anything between the face and that ball will reduce the spin so i got wet golf balls down there but that's okay make sure you have a dry face and if you're going to do this if you're going to take some practice strokes which i don't mind make sure that if you touch the ground you dry the face before you hit the shot always make sure you do that now this is about 35 36 yards uphill playing a little bit longer maybe than that but what i want to see happen in this shot is i want to be aggressive i want to fly the ball there and i want to make sure it has a little spin on it so it gets up there and checks but here's how i've done this you know me i like to i like to reduce variables in golf one of the biggest variables people put into these shots is they have wrist angle they try to hit down on the golf ball to me that's a mistake because the hands can produce a lot of angle and speed and change the angle approach of the club so what i'm going to do on this little 35 yard shot is i'm actually going to take it back with this little hinge as possible on the wrists and then accelerate the club now i say as little wrist hinge as possible you're going to see the club have a little bit of hand action but i'm not using the hands i'm letting the club kind of have a natural motion to it i'm basically having dead hands on this shot but i say that it's kind of a dead-handed shot but i'm going to accelerate the club from there that's number one number two is i'm gonna i'm gonna judge the length going back keep in mind i've practiced this on the range i go to the range and i hit this shot over and over again so i understand the length of the shot i need so here's what it's going to look like i'm going to take the arm back to right about there which is i call 730 and then i'm going to accelerate the club through now you're what you're going to see it's going to go a little further and you're going to see a little bit of that but i'm trying to hit that as dead hands as possible add a little rhythm to it and accelerate it and when i do this i get a very consistent 35 yard shot so here we go so once again 7 30 then accelerate{% endraw %}
