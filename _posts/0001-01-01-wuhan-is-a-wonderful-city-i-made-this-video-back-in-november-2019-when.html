{% raw %}I made this video back in November 2019 when I visited Wuhan for the first time. I’ve been thinking for a while now about when would I should post it. Actually, I can’t think of a better time than right now. There’s a lot of misinformation going around about what kind of city Wuhan is, with a lot of people who have never even visited the city judging it negatively. Hopefully this video can show people what a wonderful city Wuhan is.<br /><br />The next few months might be hard for a lot of people around the world, but let’s stay compassionate, stay strong, and respect and love each other. 我们一起加油 ！ Hope you’re healthy and happy wherever you may be watching in the world. <br /><br />Please share this video with your family and friends - let's spread some love and positivity together! <br /><br />Peace and love xxx Blondie{% endraw %}
