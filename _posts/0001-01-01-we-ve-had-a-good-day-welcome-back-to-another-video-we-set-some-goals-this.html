{% raw %}Welcome back to another video. We set some goals this week and we have been trying to meet a goal everyday  in orders to make that happen. We are working on some very rough terrain. Have you ever heard the saying &quot;steep as a horses face&quot;? well that is what we are dealing with. We had a good day today. It was a good day for a Monday. We are all working together and having alot of fun doing so. We got Big Red back going and the skidsteer is running good too.  I hope you enjoyed the video.
