{% raw %}Welcome back to my flipping to max set series. Today we are coming back strong with a big episode on an investment I made this month. I also will be talking about why there was a 3 month gaps between episodes.<br /><br />So in October I slowly bought into an investment I had been planning for a few weeks. Today I am going to be documenting my though process throughout the whole investment. I will be talking about why i picked my this item, and how i determined when to sell. Obviously I will be calculating how much profit, or how much I lost ( not unlikely)<br /><br />In this flipping series I am going to obtain the most expensive gear for each item slot for P2P. Now there are some very expensive items in membership. For example the 3rd age druidic set, 3rd age pickaxe, elysian... you get the idea. I think I will need to earn like 8-10B.<br /><br />RULES:<br /><br />-Start with Only 1GP at the Grand Exchange<br />-Must obtain all money from flipping<br />-Once a gear Item is purchased that can lock in the item slot<br />-Use of Alt Accounts will be allowed<br /><br />Thanks for watching<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Ironside Click here to customize your own PC<br />Use my coupon code &quot;flipping&quot; for a 5% discount!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Flipping_Ironside">https://bit.ly/Flipping_Ironside</a><br /><br />Grand Exchange Tracker<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ge-tracker.com/?ref=flippingoldschool">https://www.ge-tracker.com/?ref=flippingoldschool</a><br /><br />Discord<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.discord.gg/cewU4mE">https://www.discord.gg/cewU4mE</a><br /><br />Music Used<br />Krik<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-758259680?fbclid=IwAR0DH10dF0A5UXKq0ytoZkpdmkfhSP7M6fkDs5USkl-jd2VC2iAyTDT4dQk">https://soundcloud.com/user-758259680?fbclid=IwAR0DH10dF0A5UXKq0ytoZkpdmkfhSP7M6fkDs5USkl-jd2VC2iAyTDT4dQk</a><br /><br />Twitch:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/flippingoldschool">https://www.twitch.tv/flippingoldschool</a><br /><br />Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FlippingOSRS">https://twitter.com/FlippingOSRS</a><br /><br />Clan Chat:<br />&quot;FlippingOSRS&quot;<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Thank you to my Youtube members!<br /><br />Gohma<br />CJ Rouse<br />Faerell 2000<br />Btd6 K1ng<br />Herieman<br />Mexose<br />Tyler Mccutcheon<br />Guy Fawkes<br />Brandton Graffin<br />Samon sounds<br />Septiikos<br />WolfoftheHunt<br />ndm0001<br />yoyosup 89<br />Timothy Chen<br />Basstich<br />MageOfLink<br />Whales FTW<br />Nova<br />Ocilot<br />Kush Patel<br />Clarko<br />William Corley<br />Vasil Cholakov<br />Michael{% endraw %}
