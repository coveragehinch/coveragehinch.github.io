{% raw %}Each summer, Community Chorus Project runs a Summer Recording Workshop at UNC-Chapel Hill for high-school singers admitted after an audition process. Summer 2017, summer singers recorded this version of &quot;Because&quot; arranged by Marianne Cheng, a NYC based singer and voice teacher. Cheng additionally directs the program and conducts the chorus. Colin Egan recorded and mixed the song, and serves as assistant director for the workshop. The video was shot and directed by Zach Stamey of Focus Media. Community Chorus Project, founded by Lauren Bromley Hodge, offers this week-long Recording Workshop each summer for young singers in collaberation with the Department of Music at UNC at Chapel Hill.
