{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cctvcamerapros.com/LPR">https://www.cctvcamerapros.com/LPR</a> - LPC, LPR, and ANPR are the most used acronyms that describe different types of license plate cameras and surveillance recorders (DVRs and NVRs). The goal of this video is to help clarify how these terms are typically used by security manufacturers.<br /><br />LPC - License Plate Capture<br />License plate capture typically refers to a specialized security camera that is capable of capturing video of license plates so that the plate is clear enough to be read by a human when they play back the recorded video.<br /><br />LPR - License Plate Recognition or License Plate Reader<br />License plate recognition typically refers to a software capability of a security camera and / or recorder (DVR or NVR) to identify that a license plate has been detected by the system. Sometimes the term LPR is used in the same way LPC is used, and sometimes it is also used in the same way ANPR is used. There is overlap in the definitions that the security industry uses.<br /><br />ANPR - Automatic License Plate Recognition or Automatic License Plate Reader<br />Automatic license plate reader software is specialized software installed on a LPC camera and / or the recorder that the camera is connected to. The software is able to identify the specific letter and number characters on the license plate. Some ANPR / LPR system can also take some type of action on the identified license plate, such as recording to a database, opening a gate, triggering an alarm, comparing the plate to an authorized or not authorized plate database.<br /><br />Video Timestamps<br />================<br />0:00 Intro<br />0:08 LPC<br />0:35 LPR<br />1:13 ANPR<br />2:22 License Plate Capture Demo<br />2:47 ANPR / License Plate Recognition Demo<br />3:34 Summary<br /><br />CCTV Camera Pros used the following ANPR / LPR camera system to make this video.
