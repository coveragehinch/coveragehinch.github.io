More thermal stability? Cheaper? Easier to get? LFP batteries are like gold in the world of EVs. <br />When we're mentioning EV, how is it possible that Tesla, the brainchild of the tech god Elon Musk isn't mentioned? The Space X giant has taken one more step in the direction of success and has found another way to increase the profit margin. <br />And the best part? This time the Tesla buyers won't have to suffer pain in their wallets for Musk's profit! Tesla has been criticized a lot in the past because of their irregular yet quite frequent spikes in prices, but this time, Musk has found a solution that is environmentally friendly, cheaper, and safer!                <br />Tesla And LFP Batteries<br />According to sources, Tesla, the America-based carmaker, is shifting to Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries for all of its standard range electric vehicles. This is a massive step for the company, but it could prove highly profitable for Musk if it works out.<br />But why is Musk using LFP batteries? These batteries are known to be lower in cost and less energy-dense. The chief financial officer of Tesla, Zach Kickhorn said, &quot;The primary exposure right now is around nickel and aluminum, nickel on the cell and aluminum on non-cell&quot;.<br />Another advantage of using lithium iron phosphate batteries is that they rely on raw materials abundantly present throughout the world. Unlike the previous ones, they don't rely on scarce raw materials like cobalt and nickel. According to sources, Tesla may have switched to LFP batteries to power a significant part of its fleet. The contract would allegedly be for 10 Giga Watt hour LFP battery cells, which equals almost 200,000 50 kilowatt-hour batteries a year.  <br />This isn't the first time Tesla used LFP batteries. Until recently, Tesla has mainly relied on lithium iron phosphate batteries prepared by one of China's most famous battery-making companies, CATL. The LFP based vehicles manufactured by Tesla are being sold in China, Asia Pacific, and Europe. And, on top of that, 95% of LFP cathode manufacturing is prepared in China.<br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />🤩 The Tesla Domain is the Number 1 channel to go when you want to be up to date with the latest Tesla news, rumors, and insights.
