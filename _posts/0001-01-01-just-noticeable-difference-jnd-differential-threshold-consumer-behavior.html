{% raw %}The minimal difference that can be detected between two similar stimuli is called the differential threshold or the just noticeable difference (JND). A nineteenth-century German scientist named Ernst Weber discovered that the JND between two stimuli was not an absolute amount, but an amount relative to the intensity of the first stimulus. Weberâ€™s law, as it has come to be known, states that the stronger the initial stimulus, the greater the additional intensity needed for the second stimulus to be perceived as different.{% endraw %}
