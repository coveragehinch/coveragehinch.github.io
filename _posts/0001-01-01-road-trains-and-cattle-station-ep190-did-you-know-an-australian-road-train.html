{% raw %}Did you know an Australian road train is a massive truck that can be up to 63m long with up to 4 trailers and over 100 tyres? <br />In this video we take you up close and personal with one of these incredible machines. <br /><br />After that we head to the bush to tour Pyramid Station. A station is similar to a ranch. These enormous properties can run cattle or sheep and in some cases are larger than the smallest countries. <br />They can be millions of acres in size and graze thousands of cattle. <br /><br />We have the opportunity to hang out with the caretakers of Pyramid and learn a little about station life whilst spending time on this beautiful land. <br /><br />This video brings an end to our travels in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Stay tuned though because the adventures are far from over 😉<br /><br />If enjoy our videos and would like to support to the work we do in creating them we'd love to have you join the team by becoming a patreon and ensuring the videos and journey continue. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/GrizzlyNbear?fan_landing=true">https://www.patreon.com/GrizzlyNbear?fan_landing=true</a> <br /><br />If you would like to support us without signing up to Patreon we do have a PayPal account. <br /><br />The contributions of generous people from all over the world are what makes this possible 🙏🙏🙏 <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/GrizzlyNbear">https://www.paypal.me/GrizzlyNbear</a><br /><br />Join us as we travel the world overland, exploring the cultures and traditions of all the countries we visit.<br /><br />In our Land Rover Defender camper which is our full time home we will take you rock climbing, hiking and exploring across all the continents on this planet.{% endraw %}
