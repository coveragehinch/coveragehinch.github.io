{% raw %}Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg came to blows with his shadow opposite Thangam Debbonaire who continued her attacks on the Conservatives not wearing masks by highlighting Labour's own hypocrisy on the matter.<br /><br />The Commons leader savaged Labour's hypocrite stance. JRM said that at the Labour party conference people were not wearing masks. <br /><br /><br />He particularly cited the lack of mask wearing at the Daily Mirror conference party drink, and claimed this was evidence that “masks are worn more by socialists when there are television cameras around than when they are not going to be seen”.<br /><br />#JRM<br /><br /><br />#Labour<br />#HouseOfCommons{% endraw %}
