{% raw %}New album THE FUTURE BITES out now <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://stevenwilson.lnk.to/TheFutureBites">https://stevenwilson.lnk.to/TheFutureBites</a><br /><br />Lyric video by Lasse Hoile.<br /><br />Inspired by the plight of Syrian refugees, “Refuge” builds from the hushed beauty and pathos of the song section to an instrumental apex in which Paul Stacey​’s guitar, Mark Feltham’s harmonica and Steven Wilson​’s synth solo unite in epic glory, before dropping back down to a haunting aftermath. &quot;Refuge&quot; is a powerfully intense and cinematic highlight from the forthcoming album To the Bone.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://stevenwilsonhq.com">http://stevenwilsonhq.com</a>{% endraw %}
