{% raw %}Just saying you're a freestyler isn't enough. I made freestylers prove they could actually hit their shots by creating an insane challenge at every rank. I get dms from every rank saying they can clips like a musty flick, double tap, double flip reset and breezi all the time. Instead of just ignoring the messages, I offered $100 to each player who could actually back it up. <br /><br />Want chances to be in a video?
