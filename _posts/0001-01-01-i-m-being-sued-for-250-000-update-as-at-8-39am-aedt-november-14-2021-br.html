{% raw %}*UPDATE AS AT 8:39am AEDT November 14 2021* <br />Happy to inform everyone this legal action has ceased. Hummel have today confirmed via their lawyers they consider the dispute settled. I appreciate the support received since making this public. This support was without question the reason for the prompt resolution. Thank you! <br />Ref: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxbeeKF4GZ023cRHFrC-w2E9ziw0ofmfPV">https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxbeeKF4GZ023cRHFrC-w2E9ziw0ofmfPV</a><br /><br />- Shane Miller / GPLama <br /><br />----------<br /><br />All this drama over what should be a standard process of informing someone of the existence of a trademark and allowing them to follow the correct procedure to remove the offending artwork.
