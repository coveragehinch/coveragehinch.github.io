{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://rogerhaeske.com/?page_id=179">http://rogerhaeske.com/?page_id=179</a> - What if just about everything you were taught about nutrition were not just wrong but trapping you into a life of emotional misery, rapid aging, horrible health, lower brain power and disconnection from your higher self?<br /><br />I am about to share with you the story of how a chronically depressed and suicidal New Jersey man turned his body into a BLISS MACHINE in less than an hour by making a very simple change in his lifestyle.<br /><br />This is information that most humans on this planet know little to nothing about. This is crucial and breakthrough information that you won't find anywhere else.<br /><br />Knowing and then practicing this simple concept will dramatically improve your life in unimaginable ways, virtually overnight. <br /><br />And what's so strange is that these insights came out of me from a very basic question from an email subscriber. Of which I'll now read to you in this potentially life-changing video I made for you...<br /><br />Should you cook food &quot;like tomatoes&quot; to make certain nutrients more available?<br /><br />For instance, we are told that cooking makes the antioxidant lycopene more available in tomatoes. Is this true and what other deep implications are revealed from this very simple question?{% endraw %}
