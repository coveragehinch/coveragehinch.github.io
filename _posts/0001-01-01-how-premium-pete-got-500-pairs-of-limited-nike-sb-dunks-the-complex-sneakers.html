{% raw %}The Complex Sneakers Podcast is co-hosted by Joe La Puma, Brendan Dunne, and Matt Welty. This week, they welcome back a friend of the show Premium Pete, a renaissance man who's gone from sneaker retail to podcasting to pasta sauce to acting and everywhere in between. Pete joins the crew to share footwear stories—like how he got Air Force 1s while locked up or his stash of 400 pairs of MF Doom x Nike SB Dunk Highs—and reminisce on his journeys. Also, the gang cracks open some Manhattan specials, preps for ComplexCon, and gives some analysis on the latest UFC card.<br /><br /><br />EPISODE CHAPTERS:<br />00:00 - Start of show. <br />05:00 - Guys talk about Halloween weekend as adults and kids<br />15:00 - Guys talk friends that can't make it to ComplexCon and gifts JLP has for the guys<br />16:00 - Sneaker Giveaway Question of the Week<br />20:00 - Swapping laces, the guys talk if they do it or not<br />22:00 - Premium Pete joins the podcast for the show<br />27:00 - Premium Pete spills his Manhattan Special all over the rug, Brendan &amp; Welty follow quickly after<br />32:00 - All guys talk about what they're wearing on their feet<br />38:00 - Pete and the guys talk how sneakers are impacting his life right now<br />45:00 - Guys talk people asking them for shoes, Pete drops some knowledge on how to handle those situations <br />51:00 - Pete shoutsout DJ Clark Kent and shares some stories for his good friend<br />58:00 - Pete talks his favorite AF1 being the Roc-a-Fella<br />1:04:00 - Pete talks what qualifies as a 'legend' in the sneaker community, he also talks how he got his first part in a movie <br />1:08:00 - Welty asks which checks are better pasta or podcast checks<br />1:17:00 - End of show <br /><br />Enter for next week's sneaker giveaway here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ebay.complex.com/">https://ebay.complex.com/</a><br /><br />Looking for the Complex Sneakers Podcast Dad Hats?
