{% raw %}Giselle's back carry is an intermediate back carry that uses a rebozo pass and two cross passes.  This carry is excellent for a wiggly baby and very comfortable.  You can do any tie off method that works with ruck straps. This video shows how to do the carry, gives tips for creating cross passes and for doing the shoulder flip.  This video shows a knotless tibetan finish which is a really comfortable way to tie off the carry and can be especially comfortable for a babywearer who is pregnant because it keeps all of the weight off of the belly.{% endraw %}
