However, I made it so youtubers traded op items! This meant that every mob in the game was replaced with a different minecraft youtuber, each trading anything from their own custom items, to even real life youtuberes! Do I manage to win and beat this Minecraft challenge by trading with all the youtubers? This Minecraft challenge was really funny and hilarious!<br /><br />If this video gets 15,000 likes, I'll CHAGPOMP!<br /><br />Edited by SethBoyerD<br /><br />Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or Surviving 100 Days In Minecraft, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin<br /><br />#Minecraft #MinecraftChallenge #MinecraftBut{% endraw %}
