{% raw %}From the CD Nat King Cole's 36 All-Time Greatest Hits<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Pretend you're happy when you're blue<br /><br />It isn't very hard to do<br /><br />And you'll find happiness without an end<br /><br />Whenever you pretend<br /><br /><br /><br />Remember anyone can dream<br /><br />And nothing's bad as it may seem<br /><br />The little things you haven't got<br /><br />Could be alot if you pretend<br /><br /><br /><br />You'll find a love you can share<br /><br />One you can call all your own<br /><br />Just close your eyes, she'll be there<br /><br />You'll never be alone<br /><br /><br /><br />And if you sing this melody<br /><br />You'll be pretending just like me<br /><br />The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend<br /><br />So why don't you pretend?<br /><br /><br /><br />[Musical Interlude]<br /><br /><br /><br />And if you sing this melody<br /><br />You'll be pretending just like me<br /><br />The world is mine, it can be your, my friend<br /><br />So why don't you pretend?{% endraw %}
