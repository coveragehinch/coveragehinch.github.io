It makes them feel safe because they don't have to commit fully to any one person.<br />- Though paradoxically they want love they just won't let anyone close enough to receive it. <br />- Only when they believe that person has fully moved on will they give themselves permission to reminisce on the relationship. <br /><br />So long as you don't give into your anxious tendencies and exhibit secure tendencies you give yourself a great shot of reconnection.{% endraw %}
