Portions of some of our programs today have been mechanically reproduced. The programs telecast by this station may not be used for any purpose except exhibition at the time of their telecast on receivers of the type ordinarily used for home reception in places where no admission, cover or mechanical operation charges are made.<br /><br />This aired on local Chicago TV early Saturday, January 14th 1989.<br /><br />About The Museum of Classic Chicago Television:<br /><br />The Museum of Classic Chicago Television's primary mission is the preservation and display of off-air, early home videotape recordings (70s and early 80s, primarily) recorded off of any and all Chicago TV channels; footage which would likely be lost if not sought out and preserved digitally. Even though (mostly) short clips are displayed here, we preserve the entire broadcasts in our archives - the complete programs with breaks (or however much is present on the tape), for historical purposes. For information on how to help in our mission, to donate or lend tapes to be converted to DVD, and to view more of the 4,500+ (and counting) video clips available for viewing in our online archive, please visit us at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.fuzzymemories.tv/index.php?contentload=donate">http://www.fuzzymemories.tv/index.php?contentload=donate</a>{% endraw %}
