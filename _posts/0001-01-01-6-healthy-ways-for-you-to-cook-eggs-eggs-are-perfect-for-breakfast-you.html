Boiled<br />Eggs are a staple for many people. They have fewer calories. But as I said a second ago, eggs offer a high amount of proteins, vitamins, minerals and healthy fats. <br /><br />2. Poached<br />I donâ€™t need to introduce you to poached eggs. <br /><br />3. Fried<br />To fry the eggs, you first need to spread a thin layer of cooking fat in the pan, and heat it.<br /><br />4. Baked<br />Another form of cooking eggs is by putting them in a flat-bottomed dish before placing them in an oven. <br /><br />5. Scrambled<br />Scrambled eggs are more elaborate. The eggs are broken and poured into a bowl.<br /><br />6. Omelet<br />My favorite! The most straightforward way to make an omelet is just like the one for scrambled eggs.<br /><br />Tips to Cook Eggs in a Healthy Way<br /><br />1. Low-calorie method<br />If your aim is to reduce the number of calories you eat, but still want to include eggs as a part of your breakfast, then poaching or boiling them is the way to go. <br /><br />2. Add vegetables<br />Vegetables are a necessary part of a healthy diet. Not only are they highly nutritious, theyâ€™re also a great source of fiber. <br /><br />3. Fry them in oil thatâ€™s stable at high temperatures<br />It's not just about how you cook eggs, but what you cook them in. <br /><br />4. Choose most nutritious eggs<br />Not all eggs are the same nutrition-wise. Some are more nutritious than others.<br /><br />5. Donâ€™t overcook<br />Another key thing to keep in mind is to not overcook the eggs. <br /><br />For more information, please watch the video until the very end.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/">https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/</a>{% endraw %}
