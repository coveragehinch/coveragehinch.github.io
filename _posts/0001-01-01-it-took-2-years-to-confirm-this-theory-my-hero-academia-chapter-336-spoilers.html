{% raw %}Some time ago I released a video titled the Aoyama Traitor, Quirk Exchange Theory. In My Hero Academia Chapter 336's Spoilers, we find out just how close to the truth I actually was, as it took 2 years to finally confirm, but it seems like we managed to successfully answer one of the biggest questions in MHA: Who is the U.A Traitor?<br /><br />Last week I was tricked by Horikoshi into second guessing myself, however finally with the release of MHA 336 we know the TRUTH, as Yuga Aoyama is revealed to be the U.A Traitor. How is Aoyama tied to All for One and why is he spying on the class? What's the deal with Tooru Hagakure and is she a second traitor? Let's clear everything up and discuss what comes next after Aoyama's Reveal as BNHA enters it's final act.<br /><br />Join  the Pineapple Agency! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-j70KQRkvG8ncivshIyvHQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-j70KQRkvG8ncivshIyvHQ/join</a><br />Follow me on twitter for more updates!: www.twitter.com/VocalPineapples<br />The Aoyama Traitor Theory!
