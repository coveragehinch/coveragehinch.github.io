{% raw %}It’s always important to be on the lookout for underutilized sources of talent. Given how competitive the current market is, being able to attract star candidates is a huge boon for any organization. And there’s one pool in particular that often gets overlooked – the unemployed. With an unemployment rate of around 7% in the EU, this offers a huge opportunity for companies to find amazing employees. And, with minority groups being over-represented amongst the unemployed, this also represents a diverse and creative group of people to attract.<br />Joining us on the show today is someone who holds this cause very closely – Colin Donnery. Colin is the incoming Group Chief Executive of FRS Network, a cooperative social enterprise with subsidiaries in the recruitment, training, and agricultural sectors, and is also the Founder / Director of Turas Nua, Ireland's leading provider of employability services that help unemployed people back into the workforce. He’s here to talk to us about this diverse talent pool, the importance of confidence-building for the unemployed, and how this vital service is empowering a sector of society back into positions of employment, and why this service will become even more important in an evolving world of work.{% endraw %}
