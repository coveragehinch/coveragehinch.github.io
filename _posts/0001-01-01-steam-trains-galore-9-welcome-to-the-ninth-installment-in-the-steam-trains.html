{% raw %}Welcome to the ninth installment in the Steam Trains Galore series! In this video, we will revisit some well known railroads along with some new ones. Railroads featured include the Iowa Interstate, Cumbres and Toltec, Texas State, Virginia and Truckee, and the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad. Locomotives in several different sizes are included - everything from smaller narrow gauge locomotives to a large standard gauge 2-10-2. To finish off, we will see a steam powered rotary snow plow as it battles a steep grade in Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado. Filmed completely in 4K, Steam Trains Galore 9 promises to be the best video in the series yet!  <br /> <br />CoasterFan2105 is the home of all sorts of train and railroad related video content. Stop by every Friday at 9 AM Pacific time for an all new railroading adventure and be sure to check out all of my social media pages @coasterfan2105 for even more great railroad content.
