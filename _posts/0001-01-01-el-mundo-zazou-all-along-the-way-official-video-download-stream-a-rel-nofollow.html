{% raw %}Download/Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://souq.fanlink.to/AllAlongTheWay">https://souq.fanlink.to/AllAlongTheWay</a><br /><br />Taken from ''A Mirror for the Sun [Compiled by Niki Sadeki]'' that will be released on the 31st of August.<br />El Mundo &amp; Zazou is the new-born symbiosis of a veteran DJ/producer and a multi-instrumentalist/vocalist. Their live performances take you on a journey from punchy Downtempo vibes to Melodic Deep House spheres - gently lifting you off your feet, and slowly but surely beaming the floor beyond the horizon.<br />Mirror for the Sun is a 14-track cycle of tempos, moods, and hums exploring different facets of a softly solar energy.The compilation departs from the Souq’s signature sound, infusing it with a rotation of new elements. Niki Sadeki’s curation brings more of an uncanny Berlin-style voltage to the label’s earthy tradition, shaped by her own learned perception of deep house. The result is a cosmic and crunchy experimental blend, with mingling moments of downbeat drama and upbeat glow.<br />Music by El Mundo &amp; Zazou Release: 31st of August.<br />Video by Le Voyage Des Koumoul Label – Souq Records{% endraw %}
