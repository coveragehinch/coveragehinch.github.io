{% raw %}The La Palma / Cumbre Vieja eruption is now in its 70th day. Today's main news is that a large new fissure just opened to the south of the main cinder cone. It has since erupted a vast amount of lava over the gray ash covered landscape, leading to spectacular and fast moving flows of lava. Additionally, I present a generalized hazard map for the island of La Palma and recommends what parts of the island are safest to rebuild destroyed structures on. This video will discuss what is likely to happen next as this Spanish Canary Island volcano. <br /><br />Social media link(s) of a scientific organization which can provide more up to date information:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.involcan.org/">http://www.involcan.org/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/INVOLCAN">https://www.facebook.com/INVOLCAN</a>   <br /><br />Special Thanks: TV Canarias, INVOLCAN<br /><br />If you would like to support this channel, consider becoming a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/geologyhub.">http://patreon.com/geologyhub.</a><br /><br />Another way to support this channel is to make an order via our gemstone and geology related etsy store at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.">http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.</a>{% endraw %}
