{% raw %}Opportunity and danger side by side, that's how Jim Rohn describes the human experience. Now what you have to do is to avail the opportunity and beware of the danger. Jim Rohn in this lecture gives his insight on 5 key ideas to help you tackle the opportunities and dangers of the 21st century. These include personal philosophy, attitude, activity, measure progress, and lifestyle. If you mend your personal philosophy, you can set a better sail for the future. Your attitude affects how you feel about the past(learning from failure), present(self-confidence), and future(setting goals). The third one is activity, working on yourself and your goals. The next one is to measure progress and make sure you spend reasonable time achieving your objectives. Last is a lifestyle, Jim Rohn says that it's not a Ferrari or a million dollars that are essential for a good lifestyle, rather it's learning to live a good life within your resources while striving for better opportunities. <br /><br />Subscribe to our channel using this link for a constant flow of instructional and motivational videos from great speakers like Jim Rohn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MotivationalStories2020?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/MotivationalStories2020?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />#MotivationalStories #JimRohn <br /><br />FAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER<br />* Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
