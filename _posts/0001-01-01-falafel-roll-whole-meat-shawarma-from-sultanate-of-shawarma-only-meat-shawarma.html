Munches is basically eating something with passion and often audibly.  I don't really do ASMR food videos but still chose this name because it sounds better with Malayalam and is related to food or eating.<br /><br />What videos do I do?<br />I am currently only doing Food Videos. Specifically Food Related videos under 1 minute.  They are done in a format suitable for YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok, etc. but I only focus on YouTube Shorts at the moment.<br /><br />My favourite chocolate?<br />DairyMilk is best in terms of quality and price.  I also like lots of Cadbury products, Munch, Gulian, Lindt Lindor, etc.<br />My favourite restaurants?<br />Well, I like Fast Food a lot so KFC, Al Taza, Chicking, Chopsticks Kakkanad, Chiyang, Galitos. <br /><br />==========================================<br />üí≤ PRICE<br />Only Meat Shawarma ‚Çπ199<br />Falafel Roll ‚Çπ99<br />==========================================<br /><br />#shorts #malayalam #shawarma #chicken #falafel  #malayalammunches #munches #CreateWithCare{% endraw %}
