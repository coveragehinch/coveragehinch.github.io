(Breaking The Animatronics) | Five Nights at Freddyâ€™s: Security Breach Gameplay (Mods)<br /><br />Whatâ€™s up MA DUDES!!!! How is it going today? Today we are going to be playing FNAF with the WATER FLOOD MOD!!! We are heading back into Five Nights at Freddyâ€™s: Security Breach with MODS!!! These Five Nights at Freddyâ€™s: Security Breach mods are so cool and allow us to fly around in FNAF and break the walls down, and now even flood the game. We are going to fill the entire map in water and break all of the animatronics including Glamrock Chica, Montgomery Gator, and even Sun and Moon. Like I have said before, FNAF Security Breach hacks are so cool and allow us to even find FNAF Security Breach secret endings. This was made by my buddy Kokosko and it has infinite potential! Letâ€™s see how crazy things get when we flood Five Nights at Freddyâ€™s: Security Breach IN WATER!!! Enjoy.<br />#dakblake #fnaf #fnafsecuritybreach<br /><br />Vlog Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGmeygLoeZK_CiDam2TEj2g">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGmeygLoeZK_CiDam2TEj2g</a><br /><br />Video Edited By: Kirara Lala<br />Channel Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZXdR1P3rnZfdys3w_Lbc1g">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZXdR1P3rnZfdys3w_Lbc1g</a><br /><br />Amazing Mod By Kokosko<br />Channel Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2beA31_hVO5lgnlOojFRxg/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2beA31_hVO5lgnlOojFRxg/videos</a><br /><br />Amazing Thumbnail Art by: ComÃ¨te<br /><br /> ðŸ‘‰ Twitter ðŸ‘ˆ : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dakblake">https://twitter.com/dakblake</a><br /><br />ðŸ“¹ Instagram ðŸ“¹: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dakblake_/">https://www.instagram.com/dakblake_/</a><br /><br />Songs by Kevin Macleod<br /><br />Ending: Back Again by LEMMiNO{% endraw %}
