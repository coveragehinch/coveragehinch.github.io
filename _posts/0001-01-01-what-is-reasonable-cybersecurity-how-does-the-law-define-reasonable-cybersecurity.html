{% raw %}How does the law define reasonable cybersecurity? SecureWorld interviewed cybersecurity attorney Shawn Tuma on what reasonable cybersecurity looks like. This is part 1 - the high-level view of what is reasonable.<br /><br />&quot;From a bigger picture, reasonableness is defined by your company itself. What is reasonable to one company may not be reasonable to another. You have to start the process with a risk assessment, you have to look and see what is the risk my company faces? You have to prioritize it, you have to develop a plan. That you implements appropriate polices, procedures, tools, strategies. All that you need to help mitigate the risks you have identified as being germane to your company. And prioritize them because no one can do them all at once – and nobody expects that. But when you can show that you’ve done those things, and you can show you’ve made legitimate efforts to combat the risk that your company faces, then even when you do have an incident, it makes you look so much better in the eyes of the regulators, the judges, the attorneys. Then when you just so, you know what, I paid some guy that told me he had the policies and he implement them  and we were all done. And sorry, we make mistakes. You know, that doesn’t fly.&quot;<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For the latest in cybersecurity news, follow SecureWorld:<br /><br />Linked In:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/106644/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/106644/</a><br /><br />Twitter: @SecureWorldExpo<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SecureWorldExpo">https://www.facebook.com/SecureWorldExpo</a><br /><br />Online: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.secureworldexpo.com/">https://www.secureworldexpo.com/</a>{% endraw %}
