{% raw %}This week, the hotly-anticipated (maybe?) Xbox 360 version of Minecraft is released for XBLA. Although it's a genuinely good port of a genuinely great game, I'm having trouble figuring out who exactly would buy this over the PC version which is, objectively, a more comprehensive experience. In spite of this, I'm still finding myself re-addicted to smackin' and placin' cubes of various sorts all over again.{% endraw %}
