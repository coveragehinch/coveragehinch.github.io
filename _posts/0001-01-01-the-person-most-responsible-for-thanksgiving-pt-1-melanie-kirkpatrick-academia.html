{% raw %}Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks to Melanie Kirkpatrick, author of “Thanksgiving: The Holiday at the Heart of the American Experience”, about the truth about Thanksgiving and what the first Thanksgiving was actually like. In this clip Melanie explains why Abraham Lincoln and Sarah Josepha Hale should receive the majority of the credit for creating the Thanksgiving holiday as we know it. She also explains how the real Thanksgiving story is much different than the modern version influenced by progressive politics.<br /><br />Support Giving Tuesday!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.givingtuesday.org/">https://www.givingtuesday.org/</a><br /><br />Watch the Melanie’s PragerU video “Lincoln and Thanksgiving: The Origin of an American Holiday”<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1m5gUSRyTc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1m5gUSRyTc</a><br /><br />Want to have a glimpse of some of the research and ideas that are emerging from universities and are about to enter the mainstream and shape our culture?
