{% raw %}So, if you’re in the market for a new USA Fender, chances are you’ll be asking yourself a few questions. Not content with convention, Fender recently tapped in to the contemporary vein with their brand new Ultra Luxe series, satisfying many guitarists with a taste for more sleek and modern designs and not-so-retro features, who will now be proud to finally adopt an instrument bearing the Fender name. For others, this is heresy, and nothing but the original designs should ever be tampered with, let alone released by the Big F. And, perhaps for most, there’s always the demand for something “in the middle” - a touch of retro home comfort, with a healthy dash of 70+ years worth of player-focused innovation. <br /><br />Today, we’re going to attempt to answer as many of those questions as we can for you, by way of a full, in-depth USA Telecaster range comparison. We’ve covered every model, from the entry-level Performer, to the latest Ultra Luxe, with the Original, Performer II &amp; regular Ultra guitars taking the middle slots. Every one possesses a truly unique character, and unlocking the details of each will hopefully aid you in making the most informed purchase that you can. <br /><br />Every guitar you see featured in today’s video is available through our website, linked below. You will also have the luxury of picking the EXACT guitar you’d like to order, via its serial number, weight information, and individual set of high-resolution photos. It’s truly your purchase, your way. <br /><br />So, let us know in the comments below which guitar resonates with you the most. Are you a dyed-in-the-wool Original player?
