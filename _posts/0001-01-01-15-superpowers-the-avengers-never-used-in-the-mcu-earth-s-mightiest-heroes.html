{% raw %}Earth’s Mightiest Heroes have showcased an impressive array of abilities so far in the MCU, but can we really say everyone is being used to their full potential? I’m going to say no! Yes, in the MCU we’ve seen plenty of superpowers that leave us in awe, like Cap’s super strength, Hulk’s ability to smash and Iron Man’s genius-level intellect, but what about all of the abilities that we didn’t see? Having decades worth of comic history means that our favorite heroes have gained and lost a plethora of other abilities that you might not know about and that’s what we’re going to talk about today!<br /><br />Did you know that Tony Stark once developed technopath abilities and could actually speak to machines? If the hero was still alive, it definitely feels like that would be the next upgrade after the nanotech armor wouldn’t it? I guess we’ll never know! Did you know that Spidey at one point could talk to spiders? I now want to see the puppy-dog Tom Holland using the ability and freak out at the same time. I mean, spiders are scary right? Did you know that Doctor Strange is also an expert Martial Artist? Yeah it’s always good to know how to fight in the MCU but when you’re the sorcerer supreme, is it really necessary? <br /><br />We have all that and more coming at you today so check out the video and let us know what you think! After you’re done, be sure to hit that big like and subscribe button for more awesome MCU content like this and be sure to leave a comment or else Hulk might start talking to ghosts. Don’t want to risk that right? Let’s get into it right now!
