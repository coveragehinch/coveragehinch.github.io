Traxex is a carry who, though lacking survivability, provides a worthwhile contribution through her damage alone. With her incredible physical damage and intense slow, the Drow Ranger can be extremely powerful at any point in the game.<br /><br />As an agility hero, Traxex's damage is based largely on her basic attacks and is among the greatest largely due to the massive amounts of bonus proc damage she gains from her passive ultimate, Marksmanship, which also provides bonus Agility to nearby ranged heroes, while boosting her own Agility at the same time. Despite her lack of escape spells, Drow Ranger can keep herself relatively safe from enemy spellcasters and melee heroes using her Gust, Multishot, and her Frost Arrows, respectively. Frost Arrows infuses her attacks with ice, greatly slowing down her enemies. Since it can be manually cast, Frost Arrows can be used to harass her foes in the early game without drawing the creeps' attention. Gust is a great counter to enemy spellcasters as well as melee heroes as Gust pushes heroes away from Drow and prevents them from casting spells, who might threaten her life in battles. Multishot is excellent to chip away at multiple foes at once from a large distance (while also applying Frost Arrows). Position is of utmost importance as Traxex is quite vulnerable in close combat and the proc damage bonus from Marksmanship is removed when enemies come near her. This means she struggles against melee heroes with high mobility.<br /><br />Match ID:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/6304146111">https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/6304146111</a><br /><br />Learn about <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2:">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2:</a><br /><br />According to wikipedia.org, &quot;Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a &quot;hero&quot;, who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's &quot;Ancient&quot;, a large structure located within their base.&quot;{% endraw %}
