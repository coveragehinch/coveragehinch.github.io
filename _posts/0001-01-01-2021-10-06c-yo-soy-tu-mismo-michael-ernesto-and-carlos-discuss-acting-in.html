{% raw %}In a Zoom meeting with Ernesto and Carlos of ‘Yo Soy Tu Mismo’ (a group of Spanish devotees of Bhagavan Sri Ramana) on 6th October 2021, Michael James answers the questions:<br /><br />“We don’t know what we will experience in a year’s time, for example, could some of the reactions I stop having between now and then, detachment from likes and dislikes, understanding the meaninglessness of certain beliefs I still have as an ego, etc. be part of the Prarabdha Karma I will experience in a year’s time, etc.? That is, could acting as if everything depends on me as an ego imply that the will I put into trying to stop feeding my ego is part of what I have to do to make certain events happen or not happen in my experience one year from now?”<br /><br />While answering these questions Michael refers to and/or discusses the following passages from Bhagavan’s writings:<br /><br />The note he wrote for his mother in December 1898: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/08/praising-or-disparaging-others-is.html#dec98note">https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/08/praising-or-disparaging-others-is.html#dec98note</a><br /><br />Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu verse 38: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/10/ulladu-narpadu-tamil-text.html#un38">https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/10/ulladu-narpadu-tamil-text.html#un38</a><br /><br />Upadēśa Undiyār verse 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/09/upadesa-undiyar-tamil-text.html#uu02">https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/09/upadesa-undiyar-tamil-text.html#uu02</a><br /><br />A clearer audio copy of this video can be listened to or downloaded from Sri Ramana Teachings podcast (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ramanahou.podbean.com">https://ramanahou.podbean.com</a> ): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ramanahou.podbean.com/e/acting-in-accordance-with-prarabdha">https://ramanahou.podbean.com/e/acting-in-accordance-with-prarabdha</a>{% endraw %}
