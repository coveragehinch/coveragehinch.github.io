Nurse degree = Nurses, Physician assistant degree = physician assistant etc. <br /><br />This might seem like an unimportant point, but there are many degrees out there where almost none of the graduates end up getting a job related to the degree subject.<br /><br />This is not a problem with health majors.  These are also some of the most stable careers and health careers are growing faster than any other type of career according to BLS.gov (14% on average).  <br /><br />On top of that, health careers are very rewarding and good for certain types of people.<br /><br />These videos are for entertainment purposes only and they are just my opinion based off of my own life experience and the research that I've done.
