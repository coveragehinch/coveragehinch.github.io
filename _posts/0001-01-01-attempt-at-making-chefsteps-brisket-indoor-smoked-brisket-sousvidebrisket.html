{% raw %}#sousvidebrisket #indoorsmoked #chefstepsbrisket<br /><br />This is my attempt at making Indoor Smoked Brisket by Chefsteps. <br />The result was much better than I anticipated, yielding one of the most tender briskets I have ever made. <br />Pink salt was added 3 hours prior in order to give it the smoke ring. <br />I cooked the brisket at 60C for 48 hours instead of 68C for 24 hours. <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE for weekly videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_-8tOcJshE8R2-TS98cVg?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_-8tOcJshE8R2-TS98cVg?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br /><br />Music:<br />Funky Hip-Hop by MOKKA / Old Jeans<br />Funky Groove [Funk Music] by MOKKA<br /><br />@Mokka - No Copyright Music{% endraw %}
