{% raw %}A few weeks ago we left one metal detecting location and stopped by this 1750 stone house late in the day to knock on the door and try to test this place out. In the 3 hours we were there we found some Indian pennies, a 1700's Chinese coin, an early 1800's half cent, and much more; so we knew it would be a great location for a full day of detecting. Well, today's the day and we go back with 6 of us for a full day of detecting at this beautiful Colonial stone home to see what was dropped over the centuries.<br /><br />Perun 2 - 90° flashlight -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://olight.idevaffiliate.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=516">https://olight.idevaffiliate.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=516</a><br />Discount code for 10% off any flashlight - Quarter<br /><br /> ==========================================<br />Are you thinking about trying out metal detecting for yourself?
