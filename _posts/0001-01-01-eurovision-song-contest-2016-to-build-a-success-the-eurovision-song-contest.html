{% raw %}The Eurovision Song Contest is more than just +/- 10 hours of TV. The road to the TV shows takes months of preparation and weeks of building and tweaking so that everything is perfect for the live shows. SVT recorded a time-lapse video from the first day in Globe Arena all the way until the last box was packed and moved out of the arena again.{% endraw %}
