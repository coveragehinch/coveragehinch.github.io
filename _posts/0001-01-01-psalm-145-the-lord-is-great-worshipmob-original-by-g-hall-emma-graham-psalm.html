Hall: <br />No matter how much pain we experience or how much brokenness we have, the goodness and greatness of God never changes. <br />God revealed this song in a spontaneous worship moment. We should always desire to sing the song that Heaven is singing, the song we will all sing together at His throne, one day. <br />Thatâ€™s what Psalm 145 reminds us of. <br />___<br />From Emma Graham (spontaneous section):<br />What an honor and joy it is to worship a God who is Great!  My prayer is this song reminds us that any and all impossibilities must fall away in His presence, as we fix our gaze on the Glorious One!<br />___<br />#songsessions #worship #jesusisourhope #worshipmob #psalm145 #theLordisgreat #greatlytobepraised #highandlifted #highandliftedup{% endraw %}
