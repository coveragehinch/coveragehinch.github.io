{% raw %}On this special Christmas day broadcast, we're talking about the Christmas Hymns and carols that we sing every year. You'll know all of these songs, but we frequently don't know their stories.<br /><br />Instead of just playing the songs, I want to explain the stories behind them to you.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!{% endraw %}
