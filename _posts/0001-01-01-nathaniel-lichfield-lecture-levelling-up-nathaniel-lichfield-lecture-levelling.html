{% raw %}Nathaniel Lichfield Lecture - Levelling Up: The Role of Land Markets, Planning and Finance in Driving the Agenda<br /><br />View the lecture slides here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rtpi.org.uk/media/9813/mccann-rtpi-nathaniel-lichfield-lecture-2021.pdf">https://www.rtpi.org.uk/media/9813/mccann-rtpi-nathaniel-lichfield-lecture-2021.pdf</a><br /><br />Professor Philip Mc Cann examines different aspects of the Levelling Up agenda, both conceptually and also operationally. It discusses the role that land markets, land use planning and also the links with financial markets play in shaping economic development in general, and also in the specific context of addressing the UKâ€™s interregional inequalities and climate change mitigation strategies. The lessons and insights available from international comparators are discussed, as well as the specifics of the UK case in the light of international evidence. In particular, there is a focus on the governance and institutional challenges that need to be considered as we move forward on these issues.<br /><br />We would like to thank Dalia Lichfield Dynamic Planning for their continued support of this event.{% endraw %}
