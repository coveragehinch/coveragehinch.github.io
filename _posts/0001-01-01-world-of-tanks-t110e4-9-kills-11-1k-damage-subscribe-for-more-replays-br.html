Alongside other advanced projects, the Chrysler Corporation suggested a new tank on the basis of the TS-31 project. The main goal was to make the tank fit the Bern national tunnel. Several variants were considered, but the project was canceled.<br /><br />The T110E4 is the tier X turreted American Tank Destroyer. The E4 features an armored turret with a strong mantlet, but many weakspots and low gun depression limit the E4's hull-down potential. This tank also has much improved frontal armor on par with the T110E5. However the sides and rear armor are still incredibly weak, so make sure to keep the front towards the enemy at all times to reduce damage taken. The upgraded 155mm cannon has a lower rate of fire to balance having a rotating turret so you must stay in the line of support. Because of the nature of the design, which was finalized by Wargaming, the turret can only rotate 90 degrees to the left or right so this tank is still vulnerable to flanking to some degree. Still, the upgrade to overall armor protection and the boost to penetration and fire rate can make this tank a serious threat to anyone who happens to face it.<br /><br />The T110E4 marks the end of its American tank destroyer line.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Outro song: OST World of Tanks â€“ Intro Login 2018<br /><br /><br /><br />Mod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wgmods.net/21/details">https://wgmods.net/21/details</a>{% endraw %}
