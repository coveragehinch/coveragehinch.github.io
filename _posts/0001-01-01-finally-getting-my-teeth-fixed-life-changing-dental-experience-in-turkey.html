{% raw %}Hey my love’s,<br /><br />I finally went to visit Turkey, Istanbul &amp; decided to get teeth makeover. If you’ve followed me from a while ago , you understand how far I’ve come with my dental frustrations. I had to take a leap of faith &amp; get this done . This video will show you step by step how the procedure went by &amp; the results. @Dentakay <br /><br />I also feel like I will have to do another video to describe my dental past procedures &amp; how they failed . <br /><br />I love my new clean smile 🦷 &amp; that’s all that matters now .
