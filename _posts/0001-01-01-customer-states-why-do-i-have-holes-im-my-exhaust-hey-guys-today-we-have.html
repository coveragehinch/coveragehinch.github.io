{% raw %}Hey guys, today we have a good one. A 2008 Toyota Corolla with a major exhaust leak! The FLAVOR is strong with this one. As we looked further into the vehicle we also find not 1 but 2 Feivel nest. We go through Exhaust repair, cleaning of the entire wiper cowl area, and most of all how to properly perform a A/c vent service to disinfect the H.V.A.C. from bottom to top. Enjoy!{% endraw %}
