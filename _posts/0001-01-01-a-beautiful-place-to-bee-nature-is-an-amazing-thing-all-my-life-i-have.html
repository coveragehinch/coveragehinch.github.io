{% raw %}Nature is an amazing thing.  All my life I have respected,loved and desired to learn about the life that surrounds us after we walk out the front door.  I have tried to always connect with nature on its level and so often it has accepted me and my curiosities.  <br />   Today I was in my own little dream place of heaven on earth.  Surrounded by so much nature, that I was in sensory overload.  At one point, I was walking around the house and a Grey Rat Snake nearly ran me over as it headed off to the field near by.   It made for a great opening moment in the video I believe.  <br />   Back to the bee removal video ....  in this episode, I travel to North Alabama to remove a colony of bees from a home I've been to 5 times in the past few years to remove a hive of bees that showed up about a week earlier.   Somewhere in that area there must be a huge colony close by that loves their house as much as the homeowners do.  And every year the bees get smarter and try to hide better from Ol' Yappy Beeman.  I say challenge accepted.  And so far, I have found their nest every time.  <br />  This colony was really great to work with.  They tolerated the rehome process without giving me to much trouble and I don't recall being stung a single time. I even like to believe that after I got them home and set them up in a new beehive, some of them even landed on me to show appreciation for my good work.  <br />  The kink in this one was all because of the queen bee.  She was a slippery little gal and made me work hard to find her. But in the end she made her appearanc<br />e in true Royal form.  <br /><br />I do hope you enjoy this episode of my bee removing fun. I appreciate the feedback and hope to hear what you thought in the comments.<br /><br />Yappy Beeman is a professional bee remover  performing  live honey bee removals in Alabama as &quot;Alabama Bee Rescue&quot; and relocates them to apiaries away from residential areas so they can rebuild and thrive as a honey bee colony producing honey.
