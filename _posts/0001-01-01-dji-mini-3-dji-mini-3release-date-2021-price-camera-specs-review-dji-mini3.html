{% raw %}The DJI Mini 3 release date will be August or september 2021, if DJI wants to catch up with competition, and if not, it will probably be in november of 2021.<br />(1)Camera upgrade<br />The probability of the camera shooting 4k in 60 fps is quite high, as this would be one of the easier technical improvements they can make that still has a very strong impact on the final user.<br /><br />(2)Zoom option<br />If the camera would have even the tiniest amount of lossless zoom, it would already make a lot of difference for me.<br /><br />(3)Mini 3 range<br />We can’t really expect a longer range from the already huge 10km range of the Mini 2, but there’s for sure potential for improvement by utilizing the Ocusync 3.0 that we’ve seen in the new DJI FPV Drone.<br /><br />(4)Obstacle sensors and follow me<br />There’s no doubt whatsoever the Mini 3 or 2s will have at least front facing sensors, if not even backwards sensors too, since it might be the biggest differentiating factor from the Mini 2.It would make it finally a complete drone without flaws. However we must keep in mind that the original reason for which DJI hasn’t added obstacle sensors in the Mini 2 was overheating.<br /><br />(5)Battery life and flight modes<br />Expecting the DJI Mini 3 to inherit some of the new technology developed with the Air 2s, like the Active track 4.0, spotlight 2.0 and point of interest 3.0{% endraw %}
