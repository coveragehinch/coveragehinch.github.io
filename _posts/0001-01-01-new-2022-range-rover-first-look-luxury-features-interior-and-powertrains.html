{% raw %}The new Range Rover has been revealed, will it once again be a leader in the luxury SUV segment?<br /><br />Read more at Auto Express: <br />New 2022 Range Rover: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aex.ae/3EgjcRE">https://aex.ae/3EgjcRE</a><br />SUBSCRIBE for more news, car reviews and track tests: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://aex.ae/1OnyGV3">http://aex.ae/1OnyGV3</a><br /><br />The all-new fifth-generation Range Rover is here. It may look similar to the outgoing model from the outside but as you'll find out in our walkaround, plenty has changed on this new car.  <br />There'll be two plug-in hybrid versions on offer - both using a 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine with up to 503bhp available. Mild-hybrid tech will also be an option with a pair of 3.0-litre six-cylinder diesels and a petrol version as well. Top of the range will be a twin-turbo 4.4-litre V8 petrol pumping out 523bhp. From 2024 the range will include a fully-electric model. <br /><br />More Auto Express videos: <br />Car reviews playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://aex.ae/2gY4ViX">http://aex.ae/2gY4ViX</a><br />Track battle playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aex.ae/2U8yvdf">https://aex.ae/2U8yvdf</a><br />Car news playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aex.ae/3vyKA8G">https://aex.ae/3vyKA8G</a><br /><br />Follow us<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AutoExpress">https://twitter.com/AutoExpress</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AutoExpress">https://www.facebook.com/AutoExpress</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/autoexpress...">https://www.instagram.com/autoexpress...</a>{% endraw %}
