{% raw %}When the rain is blowing in your face<br /><br />And the whole world is on your case<br /><br />I could offer you a warm embrace<br /><br />To make you feel my love<br /><br /> <br /><br />When the evening shadows and the stars appear<br /><br />And there is no one there to dry your tears<br /><br />I could hold you for a million years<br /><br />To make you feel my love<br /><br /> <br /><br />I know you haven't made your mind up yet<br /><br />But i would never do you wrong<br /><br />I've known it from the moment that we met<br /><br />No doubt in my mind where you belong<br /><br /><br /><br />I'd go hungry i'd go black and blue<br /><br />I'd go crawling down the avenue<br /><br />No there's nothing that i wouldn't do<br /><br />To make you feel my love<br /><br /> <br /><br />The storms are raging on the rolling sea<br /><br />And on the highway of regret<br /><br />Though winds of change are blowing wild and free<br /><br />You ain't seen nothing like me yet<br /><br /> <br /><br />I could make you happy make your dreams come true<br /><br />Nothing that i wouldn't do<br /><br />Go to the ends of the earth for you<br /><br />To make you feel my love<br /><br /> <br /><br />To make you feel my love{% endraw %}
