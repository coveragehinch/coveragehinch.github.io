{% raw %}The PD-14 (Prospective Engine with 14 tf thrust) is the base engine of a family of promising Russian civilian turbojet aircraft engines, developed by the United Engine Corporation (UEC) for the MC-21 family of airliners.<br /><br />The PD-14 is the most advanced engine created in Russia and claims its rightful place among the most advanced civil aviation power plants in the world. Belonging to the 5th generation, it has incorporated all the latest technologies, solutions and materials available at the moment, which already at the stage of creation gave a huge leap forward to the entire Russian engine building industry: from science and development to testing and production.<br /><br />Thanks to the knowledge and technology gained in the creation of this motor, the industry has the opportunity to create other advanced engines of different classes. Several major projects are already underway, from the small PD-8 to the super-powerful PD-35, which is being developed for heavy transports and long-haul airliners.<br /><br />In today's story we will take a closer look at the PD-14, learn how the creators managed to achieve the high performance of the engine, how it was developed, how it was produced and due to what advantages will it be able to successfully compete in one of the most technologically complex and competitive markets in the world.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Subscribe to the channel, like and comment!<br /><br />If you want to support Skyships and our work, welcome to our Patreon.
