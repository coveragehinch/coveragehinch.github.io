{% raw %}An American reconnaissance aircraft gave the air defense positions of the DNR and LNR to the AFU<br /><br />The U.S. helped the Ukrainian Armed Forces to obtain the coordinates of LNR air defense positions.<br /><br />The appearance of the American military reconnaissance aircraft Boeing RC-135W over Donbass is not just an attempt by Washington to show Russia support for Kiev, but also has practical significance for the AFU. With the help of such a flight the US military received the information about all the air defense facilities of the self-proclaimed republics, which enables the Ukrainian military to deprive the self-proclaimed DNR and LNR of the means for protection from the air attack with the use of artillery or the Bayraktar TB2 drones, which are in Kiev's inventory.<br />Specialists note that earlier flights of strategic reconnaissance drones in this region allowed receiving only general information, but the Boeing RC-135W aircraft gives an opportunity to receive reliable data on the work of any means which emit radio waves and signals, especially as the Donetsk and LNR have no modern air defense and air defense systems which can work in the passive mode. After an American military reconnaissance aircraft was spotted in Donbass less than a day ago, Washington has already been accused of an attempt to cross the &quot;red line,&quot; although there have been no official comments from Moscow on this matter so far.{% endraw %}
