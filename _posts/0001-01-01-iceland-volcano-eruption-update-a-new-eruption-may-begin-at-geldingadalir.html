{% raw %}On December 21st, the alert level of the Krysuvik volcano in Iceland was raised from yellow to orange. This occurred due to a series of several thousand shallow earthquakes whose epicenters were located on the Reykjanes peninsula. These earthquakes have a magmatic signature, indicating that a new eruption could begin once again on the peninsula. It may only be a matter of time before the famed Geldingadalir volcano erupts again or a new vent emerges. This video will separate fact from fiction, and discuss the true odds of volcanic activity on this peninsula.<br /><br />Links to more official sources:<br /><br />Icelandic Meteorological Office: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.vedur.is/">https://en.vedur.is/</a><br />Government of Iceland: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.government.is/">https://www.government.is/</a><br />University of Iceland: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://english.hi.is/">https://english.hi.is/</a><br /><br />Thumbnail Photo Credit: Game McGimsey, AVO/USGS<br /><br />If you would like to support this channel, consider becoming a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/geologyhub.">http://patreon.com/geologyhub.</a><br /><br />Another way to support this channel is to make an order via our gemstone and geology related etsy store at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.">http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.</a>{% endraw %}
