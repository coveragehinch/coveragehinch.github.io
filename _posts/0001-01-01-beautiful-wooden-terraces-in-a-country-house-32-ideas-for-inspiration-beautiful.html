{% raw %}Beautiful wooden terraces in a country house! 32 ideas for inspiration!<br /><br />The main elements of a wooden terrace are a base (usually made of point supports), a supporting beam-lag structure and a flooring. Additionally, significant deck heights may require additional steps and balustrades.<br /><br />Materials and estimation of their quantity<br /><br />As you know, the wood used to create various building (and not only) structures is diverse. As for the kind that are well suited for creating terraces, among them cedar and mahogany should be noted: the fact is that they perfectly resist the effects of moisture and microorganisms. Quite good options are pine and spruce, from which, with proper processing, magnificent sites are obtained. What kind of wood to choose for the construction of a terrace is a matter of the availability of financial resources, however, as for the flooring, it does not make much sense for him to use a valuable and really expensive tree: a high-quality pine is also quite suitable.<br /><br />After the final choice is made in favor of the type of wood, it is necessary to determine exactly how much material. In order not to be mistaken in this important matter, experts advise to proceed as follows: first, draw up a general drawing of the future terrace, then calculate exactly how much wood is needed to make each of its elements, and then summarize all the data obtained. It should be borne in mind that after cutting long workpieces, there may well be scraps of considerable length that can be used.<br /><br />This video is educational in nature!
