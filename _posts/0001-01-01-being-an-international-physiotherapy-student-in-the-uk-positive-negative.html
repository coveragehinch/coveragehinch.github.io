{% raw %}Hey guys in this video I discuss what are some of the perceived positive and negative sides to being an international student and studying physiotherapy in the UK <br /><br />Now just to let you know I am not an international student, I’ve been living in the UK since the age of 5 so would consider myself British more than anything but all of the points I talk about here were provided to me by one of my good friends I studied with on the course who did come from another country – Hungary. She very kindly allowed me to share these points for you so hopefully you can gain some insight. <br /><br />For a summary of points see below:<br /><br />Positives: <br />1) The chance to carry out research in real life<br /><br />The opportunity to get involved in research // at my university, we managed to carry out small scale research projects which gave us a chance to get a taste of how research is done in real life. Though small scale pilot studies, the experience is very good as I know some universities only give the option of doing a lit review and discussion of potential results rather than actually practically going out and getting results. <br /><br />2) Real life experience of how physio is done in the UK  <br /><br />An increased awareness of different health systems in the UK which allows you to be more critically aware of how healthcare could be improved or altered in other areas of the world. <br /><br />3) The large amount of clinical work experience you will gain<br /><br />A good amount of clinical work experience during placements 1000 hours to gain qualification<br /><br />4) Experience a new culture and meet new people<br /><br />One of the best reasons to attend a university outside of your home country/location. Get out there!<br /><br />Negatives<br />1) Medical and British language - steeper learning curve<br /><br />Medical jargon can make it more tricky and increase the learning curve compared to someone who had English as their first language <br /><br />Words like A &amp; E, limping, wobbly, specifying pain i.e sharp, dull, aching, burning.<br /><br />2) Less tailored learning support<br /><br />Sometimes teachers may not know how to best support you since they cannot understand your native culture and other times may not even be interested, which is a shame.<br /><br />3) Isolation because of your background<br /><br />Again, this is a shame, but it is rare, though should be aware of.<br /><br />4) Less emphasis on research from outside countries<br /><br />UK physio course does not take into account some positive research or emerging research in other countries and favours UK research more than anything which makes sense because the course is run with the NHS where you complete your placements and care in the NHS is influenced by UK research so it makes sense to be competent in those paradigms. <br /><br />My other channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2sfbXa5">https://bit.ly/2sfbXa5</a> <br /><br />Please LIKE,COMMENT and SUBSCRIBE if you found that useful!! <br /><br />As always if you had any queries or concerns about anything, give me a shout and I would be happy to help. <br /><br />Buy my Ebook if you are a Plymouth Uni Applicant: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/DeZB1H">https://goo.gl/DeZB1H</a> <br /><br />Download my FREE E-BOOK on Social Media:  <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2DARoen">http://bit.ly/2DARoen</a><br /><br />★☆★ SUBSCRIBE TO ME ON YOUTUBE: <br /><br />★☆★ Subscribe ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2sfbXa5">https://bit.ly/2sfbXa5</a> I have actually started a new YOUTUBE channel (very confusing, I know)<br /><br />Instagram ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/zZMU7E">https://goo.gl/zZMU7E</a> <br /><br />Snapchat ► masudsaeedi <br /><br />Facebook ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/GsYzJp">https://goo.gl/GsYzJp</a><br /><br />Thanks guys, hope you enjoyed this video!{% endraw %}
