Numbers and odds are based on reasonable sources, where appropriate, otherwise calculated from number of individual records over total population (which may be an underestimate). This video is for entertainment purpose only, is not scientifically proven and should be used with caution. The last animal featured is compared against the total fish population for both albinism and cyclopia, this is the only exisitng record of such case hence such probability, but more could potentially exist but not found. <br /><br /><br />Sources: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/R9WYNa1v">https://pastebin.com/R9WYNa1v</a><br /><br /><br />Music Used: <br />Lost Within by A Himitsu <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/a-himitsu">https://soundcloud.com/a-himitsu</a><br />Music by A Himitsu (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCgFwu-j5...)">https://youtube.com/channel/UCgFwu-j5...)</a><br />Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2RuWYmu">http://bit.ly/2RuWYmu</a><br />Music promoted by Audio Library <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DHNZeIy4kjs">https://youtu.be/DHNZeIy4kjs</a>{% endraw %}
