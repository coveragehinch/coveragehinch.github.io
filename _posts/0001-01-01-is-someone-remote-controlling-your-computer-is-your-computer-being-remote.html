{% raw %}Is your computer being remote controlled? Without using the proper tools, there is no actual good defense against advanced malware like Remote Access Trojans, Keyloggers, Ransomware, and even just good 'ol spyware from Big Tech. <br /><br />You need network monitoring tools to check the outgoing traffic and then put rules in effect so you either get alerted or block programs on your computer that try to talk to some command and control on the Internet. This is the job of an outgoing firewall. And today we will introduce you to Little Snitch for MacOS and Glasswire for Windows.<br /><br />Without using these tools you are helpless. Antivirus software will not help you. This is just an introduction.<br /><br /><br />Check Out Startpage Search Engine<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.startpage.com/?segment=startpage.referral&amp;utm_source=rob.braxman">https://www.startpage.com/?segment=startpage.referral&amp;utm_source=rob.braxman</a><br /><br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />I'm the Internet Privacy Guy. I'm a public interest technologist. I'm here to educate. You are losing your Internet privacy and Internet security every day if you don't fight for it. Your data is collected with endless permanent data mining. Learn about a TOR router, a VPN , antivirus, spyware, firewalls, IP address, wifi triangulation, data privacy regulation, backups and tech tools, and evading mass surveillance from NSA, CIA, FBI. Learn how to be anonymous on the Internet so you are not profiled. Learn to speak freely with pseudo anonymity. Learn more about the dangers of the inernet and the dangers of social media, dangers of email.<br /><br /><br />I like alternative communication technology like Amateur Radio and data communications using Analog.
