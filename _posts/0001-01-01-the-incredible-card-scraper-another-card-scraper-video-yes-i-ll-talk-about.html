{% raw %}Another Card Scraper video? Yes!  I'll talk about a couple of things that could make a huge difference if you're having trouble optimizing this simple, yet amazing little tool!  I break the sharpening process down into three seperate steps:<br />Step one: File the edge, starts at :28<br />Step two: Refine the edge, starts at 4:03<br />Step three: Burnish the edge, starts at 11:41<br /><br />Please note, that if you have a brand new scraper and you're having a hard time creating a &quot;hook&quot; or cutting burr...look closely at the scrapers edge.  It may be rolled...created if the scraper was stamped out of a large sheet.  This roll must be filed, honed, ground...however you do it, it has to be removed or you'll NEVER have good sharpening results.  <br /><br />Shapton ceramic glass stones...I love these!  In the video, I progress from 1200 grit diamond to 8000 Shapton.  In reality, it would be better to advance from the 1200 grit to a 3000 Shapton, then to the 8000 grit Shapton...but for now, this works!  <br /><br />Stew Mac...The Ultimate Scraper. (I show this at 5:44) This is a Luthiers scraper and gets sharpened in a totally different way.  Check out my YouTube video here:{% endraw %}
