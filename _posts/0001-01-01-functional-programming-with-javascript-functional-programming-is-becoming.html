{% raw %}Functional Programming is becoming increasingly popular and relevant with each year that goes by. With so much discussion around languages such as F#, Haskell and Erlang, it can seem as though getting started with Functional programming would mean first learning a whole new syntax...but what if it didn't?<br />Using just a few JavaScript libraries, such as RamdaJS, developers can implement some of the most powerful patterns and techniques from the world of functional programming?<br />This talk will demonstrate how, using ES6 and a few extra libraries, we can write Functional code that is:<br />More robust<br />Easier to read<br />Easier to maintain<br />This talk might be of interest to anyone looking into moving to a new platform, or in improving the scalability of an existing application, or even just interested in seeing what Functional Programming is all about, but all within the comfort of a familiar language.<br />We might even attempt the impossible, and explain what a Monad is!<br /><br />PUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:<br />Original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
