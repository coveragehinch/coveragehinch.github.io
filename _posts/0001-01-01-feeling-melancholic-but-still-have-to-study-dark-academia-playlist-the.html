{% raw %}The melancholy is setting in, but you still have things to do. You find yourself a quiet corner in the library, put on your headphones, and let yourself feel the feels. It's time to study for that exam, finish up that paper, or just grind away at whatever work to-do is lingering. <br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />All Audio within this video came from Epidemic sound.

However, we understand that some people want to listen to the same thing for longer. We recommend using the Loop feature built into YouTube. <br /><br />Looping on Mobile: On most mobile devices, if you tap the video window you will bring up several buttons overlaid on the video. In the top right corner, there are three little dots in a vertical line. If you click those dots and select Loop Video, then the video will automatically restart when it finishes. <br /><br />Looping on PC or Mac: Right click or Ctrl + Click on the video itself. This will bring up a menu of options. Click on loop and then the video will automatically restart when it finishes.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br /><br />Hi there! <br /><br />My name is Margaret and along with my husband, Brian, we run Emotive Ambience and Immersive  Ambience. I am a licensed clinical psychologist and artist of many mediums, ceramic/pottery being my favorite.  My husband runs a small, family travel company and is a hobbyist photographer. <br /><br />We make these videos in the hopes that they will allow you to take a break from the chaos and stress of daily life. These videos are meant to be a tool that people can use to help them focus, relax and practice some self-care, and/or fall asleep too. Some of the common uses for these types of videos would be background noise for studying or working, white noise for sleeping, stress relief, and/or inspiration and increased creativity. <br /><br /><br />Immersive Ambience: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3nHCURl">https://bit.ly/3nHCURl</a> <br />Emotive Ambience: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3AkMUDC">https://bit.ly/3AkMUDC</a> <br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br /><br />Disclaimer: Immersive Ambience &amp; Emotive Ambience is for entertainment purposes only and should never be used to replace any medical or mental health treatment.
