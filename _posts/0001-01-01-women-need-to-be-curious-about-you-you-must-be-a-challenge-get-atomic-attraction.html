{% raw %}Get Atomic Attraction (Audiobook/Kindle/Paperback): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/atomic-attraction/">https://www.developattraction.com/atomic-attraction/</a><br /><br />The compulsive need to reveal too much information about yourself and your feelings must be repressed. How can a woman find you mysterious when she knows exactly what you’re thinking on a day-to-day basis? Wearing your heart on your sleeve and expressing your innermost feelings spoils intrigue and crushes desire. <br /><br />Less is more. Less initial effort, less initial investment, and less initial expenditure shows a woman that you’re not actively seeking a relationship. This helps foster a more relaxed environment, an environment that’s conducive to seduction. <br /><br />Instead of being relationship focused, you must keep the conversation light and playful. Tease a woman, have fun, and never take her or yourself too seriously. The more time you spend talking to a woman, the more she gets to know you and the more comfortable and secure she’ll feel in your presence. Your mission, however, is to remain slightly unknowable and mysterious in the early stages of a relationship.<br /><br />You should never allow a woman full access to your mind. The misguided belief that you should share your innermost thoughts and feelings is an illusion propagated by a tell her all your feelings and she’ll love you for it culture. Many men have traveled this road before with disastrous consequences. <br /><br />All too often I see men open their hearts only to see women respond with a loss of attraction. How could this happen? What happened to the wonderful connection they both shared? <br /><br />The next time you think about opening up to a woman ask yourself this: what are you trying to achieve? Sympathy? Understanding? Reassurance? A sense of closeness? If that’s the case, you’d be better off seeking solace in friends and family, for self-disclosure and attraction rarely go hand-in-hand. Men of mystery are attractive because they understand that less is more and women need to be challenged.<br /><br />If you want to maintain attraction with a woman, right from the moment you first meet her all the way through to a long-term relationship, then I highly recommend you get a copy of my book Atomic Attraction.<br /><br />Click to read the full article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/maintain-mystery/">https://www.developattraction.com/maintain-mystery/</a><br /><br />Check out the Get Her Back (Action Plan) for the best way to get your girlfriend back if she's pulled away from you or left you.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/get-her-back/">https://www.developattraction.com/get-her-back/</a><br /><br />Please click the link below to make a donation to support my work via PayPal:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=FAD82HTR5UJ36">https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=FAD82HTR5UJ36</a><br /><br />Click the link below if you need Emergency Email/Skype support:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/emergency-help/">https://www.developattraction.com/emergency-help/</a><br /><br />Click the link below to send me an email or visit my website (DevelopAttraction.com):<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/">https://www.developattraction.com/</a><br /><br />Trust yourself and trust the process,<br /><br />Chris Canwell{% endraw %}
