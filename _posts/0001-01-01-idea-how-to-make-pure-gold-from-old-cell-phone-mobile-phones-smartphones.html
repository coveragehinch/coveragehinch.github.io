{% raw %}😱😱♻️ 💰👉👉  From an environmental perspective, is it still better to fix your old phone than to get a new one, even if you recycle?<br />From an environmental perspective, it’s always good if you keep the products longer because it means new natural resources don’t have to be extracted. But having said that, as long as you make sure that you discard your old phone and the material is kept in the loop, it’s not that bad.<br />Recycling can create jobs, and recycling done in the right way can be a profitable business. There is a good opportunity to keep our environment clean, to keep resources in the loop, so there are societal benefits in recycling. The worst thing that can happen is that we keep producing new phones and all the discarded ones are just staying in our drawers because resources are limited. If we keep those resources in our houses, hidden, then we might face a supply chain problems or restriction in the near future.<br />idea how to make pure gold from old cell phone mobile phones Smartphones<br />#smartphones <br />#CellPhone <br />#MobilePhones{% endraw %}
