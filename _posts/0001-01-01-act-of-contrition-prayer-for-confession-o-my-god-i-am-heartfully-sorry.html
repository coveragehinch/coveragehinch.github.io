{% raw %}O my God, I am heartfully sorry for having offended thee, and I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishment, but most of all because I have offended Thee my God, Who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen.<br /><br />Be a part of our Prayer Warrior Community! <br /><br />Prayer Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.christiancatholicmedia.com/blogs/catholic-prayers-devotions/act-of-contrition">https://www.christiancatholicmedia.com/blogs/catholic-prayers-devotions/act-of-contrition</a><br /><br />YOUR DONATION MATTERS TO US!<br /><br />Donate here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.christiancatholicmedia.com/donate">https://www.christiancatholicmedia.com/donate</a><br /><br />Want to become Catholic to be part of the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church founded by Christ?

We are here to help with both of these issues.<br /><br />Our mission is to help get people to Heaven. To educate and inspire Catholics to defend and live out their faith and grow closer to God. It is also our mission to lead non-Catholics into conversion to the Catholic faith.<br />—<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://christiancatholicmedia.com/Facebook">http://christiancatholicmedia.com/Facebook</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://christiancatholicmedia.com/Instagram">http://christiancatholicmedia.com/Instagram</a><br />Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://christiancatholicmedia.com/podcast">http://christiancatholicmedia.com/podcast</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://christiancatholicmedia.com/LinkedIn">http://christiancatholicmedia.com/LinkedIn</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://christiancatholicmedia.com/Twitter">https://christiancatholicmedia.com/Twitter</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://christiancatholicmedia.com/YouTube">http://christiancatholicmedia.com/YouTube</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://christiancatholicmedia.com">https://christiancatholicmedia.com</a><br />Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.christiancatholicshop.com">https://www.christiancatholicshop.com</a><br /><br />—<br />Subscribe to our VIP newsletter for updates and giveaways: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://christiancatholicmedia.com/newsletter">http://christiancatholicmedia.com/newsletter</a>{% endraw %}
