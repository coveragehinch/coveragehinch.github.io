{% raw %}If you have wondered how to meditate or how to start morning devotion or how to begin a meditation, Saint Francis De Sales has some guidelines for you on how to do your daily meditation. He wrote everything on his book called : Introduction to the Devout Life. There are many different printings in english but I do actually want to buy the old English version just to find the real meaning of what Saint Francis says in this book but maybe it's ok if you start with the new translation of this book - new version. This one I used the new version - the language is not that hard for milenials to comprehend it.<br /><br />Rosa Mystica Podcast is available on:<br />✅  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rosa-mysticas-podcast/id1593812844">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rosa-mysticas-podcast/id1593812844</a><br /><br />✅  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2fQsdB8grHeLLIeQAex4Ji">https://open.spotify.com/show/2fQsdB8grHeLLIeQAex4Ji</a><br /><br />✅  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1593812844">https://overcast.fm/itunes1593812844</a><br /><br />Don't forget to like, subscribe and share this video to support this channel.
