{% raw %}1ºBachillerato, 2ºBachillerato<br /><br />**Hey everyone, a lot of you have told me that the link to the chart doesn't work, so I've deleted it. It turns out it's a bit difficult to share a file publicly. Instead, I recommend you just pause the video and take some notes or screen shot it to save it. Happy studying!{% endraw %}
