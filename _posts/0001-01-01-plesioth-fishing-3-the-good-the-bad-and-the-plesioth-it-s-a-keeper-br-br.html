{% raw %}It's a keeper<br /><br />Plesioth Fishing Rules:<br />NO Smoke Bombs allowed.. just Frog bait and 1 hunter.. If you get seen by Plesioth before fishing it out.. you have to abandon the quest and try again :)<br /><br />(I do not own the music/fair use)<br /><br />music: <br />José González - Far Away{% endraw %}
