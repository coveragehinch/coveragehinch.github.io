{% raw %}Faith Foundations: In life, we often find ourselves trying to figure out everything on our own. We throw away the IKEA manual, we wander around the grocery store refusing to ask where the chips section is, and we don't ask for help when life takes a turn. Well luckily for us, God has provided a manual for how to live life in the Bible! God's Word is filled with guidance, instruction, and direction for our lives. We just need to take the time to open it up and read it.<br /><br />This is Faith Foundations hosted by Tammy Kanei. In this series Tammy will take us through the most basic, foundational aspects of our faith as Christians.<br /><br />::CREDITS::<br />Narrated by TAMMY KANEI and featuring CHRIS CARMAN, STEPHANIE McCALLIE, and LUKE McCALLIE.<br />Executive Producer: Mark McCallie<br />Producers: Kevin Harris, David Harvilla<br />Story Director: Kevin Harris<br />Story Writer: Tammy Kanei, Kevin Harris<br />Director of Photography: Kevin Harris<br />1st AC: August Rice<br />Gaffer/Key Grip: August Rice<br />Location Sound Mixer: David Harvilla<br />Lead Editor &amp; Graphics Design: Kevin Harris<br />Post-Production &amp; Sound Supervisor: David Harvilla<br /><br />Shot on Sony a7S III with 17-35mm Gmaster lens.<br /><br />Connect with JUCE on social media<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jucetv.com">https://www.jucetv.com</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jucetvnetwork">https://twitter.com/jucetvnetwork</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/jucetvnetwork">https://instagram.com/jucetvnetwork</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/jucetvnetwork">https://facebook.com/jucetvnetwork</a><br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell so you don't miss future episodes. <br /><br />See all our shows:<br /><br />Kingdom Thinking: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcT9LlVRWtuwJu_yRssCD6wQmKtUuT2Xm">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcT9LlVRWtuwJu_yRssCD6wQmKtUuT2Xm</a><br />Overtime: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcT9LlVRWtux33QxBdCtdTKAOgGahWFDu">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcT9LlVRWtux33QxBdCtdTKAOgGahWFDu</a><br />Timeout!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2RXVoNb">https://bit.ly/2RXVoNb</a><br />On Ice with JJ Carroll: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/39ckX2z">https://bit.ly/39ckX2z</a><br />Up Close: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2tuzuHX">https://bit.ly/2tuzuHX</a><br />Know, Do or Die: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/382OZpm">https://bit.ly/382OZpm</a><br />Backstage @: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2GS4O6s">https://bit.ly/2GS4O6s</a><br />With the core belief that all life matters, JUCE aspires to provide content that values everyone, entertains and celebrates life, and above all, helps people find the meaning of life by connecting them with the Creator of life.<br /><br />We do faith &amp; we do entertainment.
