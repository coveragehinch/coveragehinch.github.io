{% raw %}Saint Francis Xavier, Priest<br />Memorial<br /><br />St. Francis Xavier was a Jesuit priest in the 1500’s. The son of an aristocratic Spanish-Basque family, he received the best education; studying at the University of Paris. While there; he met St. Ignatius of Loyola and with several other men, took vows to follow Christ. In 1541, St. Francis, now an ordained priest, was appointed apostolic nuncio in the East. He traveled to Goa, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, China, and Japan establishing missionary outposts and converting hundreds of thousands. He was canonized in 1622. For his apostolic zeal, Pius X named him the patron of foreign missions.<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />Let us &quot;sanctify our day&quot; by praying the Liturgy of the Hours.<br /><br />The Liturgy of the Hours (Latin: Liturgia Horarum) or Divine Office (Latin: Officium Divinum) or Work of God (Latin: Opus Dei) or canonical hours,often referred to as the Breviary,is the official set of prayers &quot;marking the hours of each day and sanctifying the day with prayer&quot;.It consists primarily of psalms supplemented by hymns, readings and other prayers and antiphons. Together with the Mass, it constitutes the official public prayer life of the Church. The Liturgy of the Hours is the prayer of the whole People of God. In it, Christ himself “continues his priestly work through his Church.” His members participate according to their own place in the Church and the circumstances of their lives. The laity, too, is encouraged to recite the divine office either with the priests, among themselves or individually.<br /><br />Let us join the Universal Church in praying the Divine Office.<br />.<br />Amid coronavirus outbreak, with many people unable to attend Mass and isolated in their homes, Divine Office is inviting us to join in prayer. We hope more brothers and sisters will find spiritual nourishment, strength, and consolation in praying the Liturgy of the Hours as we all go through these difficult, uncertain times.<br /><br />We pray that this COVID19 come to end and for world peace.<br /><br />==================<br />CREDITS TO: <br /><br />Audio and text belongs to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://divineoffice.org">https://divineoffice.org</a><br /><br />To offer support through the current pandemic crisis, the Divine Office Catholic Ministry made the website available to new members.
