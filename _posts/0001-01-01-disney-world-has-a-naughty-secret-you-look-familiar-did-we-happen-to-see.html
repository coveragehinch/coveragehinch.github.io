{% raw %}You look familiar, did we happen to see you on the dance floor at Mannequins in Disney World back in 1996? You were wearing Bongo jeans, and we locked eyes for a split second, but we were halfway to the door on our way to Eight TRAX because we had a hankering for a Leisure Suit.<br />If that really was you, then you will love this Nightlife episode of RTT. Not only are we covering all things Pleasure Island, we’ll be resort hopping to catch up with Yeeha Bob Jackson and his wobbly piano at River Roost Lounge, singing the hits to not one but TWO PIANOS AT ONCE at Jellyrolls and boogying down to throwback hits with the approximately 3 other attendees at our current favorite “We’ll-take-whatever-we-can-get” Disney World dance club, Atlantic Dance Hall.<br />What do you mean you weren’t born yet in 1996? Well you’re in for quite an education today because Disney World Has A Naughty Secret.<br /><br />-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br /><br />Did you enjoy this video?
