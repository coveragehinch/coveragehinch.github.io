{% raw %}Congressman Scott Perry has refused the House select committee's request for information and testimony about the incidents surrounding the insurrection. It's no surprise Perry is afraid to testify, given that he reportedly tried to help Tump install DOJ official Jeffrey Clark as acting Attorney General. Recall Clark is the Trump co-conspirator who tried to corrupt and weaponize the Department of Justice in an attempt to pressure Georgia to change the election results. Perry also reportedly was having conversations with Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on encrypted apps. The fact of the mater is, Perry has but one legitimate way to avoid testifying before the committee - invoke his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination. <br /><br />For our Team Justice and Justice Matters merchandise shop, please visit: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/">https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/</a><br /><br />Please consider becoming a #TeamJustice patron at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner">https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner</a><br /><br />My podcast, &quot;Justice Matters with Glenn Kirschner&quot; can be downloaded where you get your podcasts.
