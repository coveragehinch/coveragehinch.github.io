{% raw %}Did you know that Gordon Ramsay Actually enjoys life, even with all of his screaming? Gordon Ramsay is famous for being the meanest chef on television and, watching his shows, it’s rare to see him pay a compliment or express genuine, unadulterated kindness. As a married father of four and a human being, it's obvious that Ramsay does have a few things in his day that actually bring a smile to that typically scowling face of his. From In-N-Out Burger, tweeting on Twitter, to his love of Ferrari, we delved through as much Ramsay related video, interview, articles and audio to hopefully find the answer to what brings Ramsay happiness. If you ever find yourself on the receiving end of one of his tirades, you’ll be ready to pacify the beast.
