{% raw %}So I have decided to create a 3D animation of the iconic Enterprise 1701-D from Star Trek from the Next Generation.  Enjoy!<br /><br />The USS Enterprise 1701-D is an updated and evolution to the original USS Enterprise 1701 from the Star Trek media franchise.<br /><br />Under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, it is the main setting of Star Trek: The Next Generation and server as the Starfleet flagship for seven years (1987â€“1994).<br /><br />The Next Generation occurs in the 24th century, 78 years after the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk and the starship Enterprise. <br /><br />Artist Andrew Probert was in charge of redesigning the Enterprise-D, which was an update to Matt Jefferies' iconic 1960s Enterprise designs, depicting a ship supporting a larger crew on a longer mission &quot;to boldly go where no one has gone before.&quot;<br /><br />The updated Enterprise retains the signature of Matt Jefferies' design for the original Enterprise: a saucer section, engineering section, and a pair of engine nacelles.<br /><br />With a total of 42 decks, the Enterprise-D was twice the length and had eight times the interior space of the Constitution-class ships of over a century earlier. She carried a combined crew and passenger load of 1,012.<br /><br />Defensive systems included 10 phaser banks, 250 photon torpedoes, and a high capacity shield grid; there are some 4,000 power systems in all aboard ships.<br /><br />USS Enterprise 1701-D Blueprint<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cygnus-x1.net/links/lcars/star-trek-the-next-generation-enterprise.php">https://www.cygnus-x1.net/links/lcars/star-trek-the-next-generation-enterprise.php</a>{% endraw %}
