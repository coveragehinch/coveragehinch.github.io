{% raw %}Business Enquiries ► Lorenzovareseaziendale@gmail.com<br />- -<br /><br />Before the 20th century, we had a pretty good theory that explained a bunch of stuff.<br />It explained the motion of the planets around the Sun (specifically, it explained why planets follow an elliptical path). <br />This was the Newton theory. Among other things, it showed that humans can fly on aeroplanes. It also suggested the idea that an apple and a feather fall with the same acceleration of 9.81 meters per second squared in the void. <br />But then, one day, this theory was found to be slightly wrong. <br />This is because Einstein gave us a better one, which included an extended Newton's theory.<br />Einstein's gift was amazing. <br />Its theory, the theory of general relativity, is the best theory of gravitation we have so far. <br />It fits data, it predicts complex behaviours of celestial objects, and also it is very precise. <br />For example, when astronomers found that Mercury's orbit was preceding – shortly meaning that their measurements of Mercury's orbit period were incompatible with Newton's law- the only possible explanation to that was to add a perturbation. <br /><br />- -<br />&quot;If You happen to see any content that is yours, and we didn't give credit in the right manner please let us know at Lorenzovareseaziendale@gmail.com and we will correct it immediately&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Some of our visual content is under an Attribution-ShareAlike license.
