{% raw %}#ReadingBear #Entitledpeople #Revenge<br />Here on ReadingBear I am reading exciting, often user submitted stories, daily. These stories are really fun and my channel is unique because I try to read the stories as clearly as possible for accessibility. I want that each and every single viewer can enjoy my content even if they have disabilities. Inclusiveness is very important for me when it comes to Youtube content! In addition I add pictures and videos to bring the stories to life and to give them my own unique little twist!<br /><br />Posts some bear emojis to support me :)<br /><br /># Full list of images and attributions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/credit001">https://tinyurl.com/credit001</a><br />&quot;Ultralounge&quot; by Kevin MacLeod (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://incompetech.com)">https://incompetech.com)</a><br />License: CC BY (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a>{% endraw %}
