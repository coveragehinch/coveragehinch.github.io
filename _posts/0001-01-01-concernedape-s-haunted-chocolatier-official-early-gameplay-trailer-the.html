{% raw %}The reveal trailer for Haunted Chocolatier, the next game from Stardew Valley creator Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone. While not a direct sequel to Stardew Valley, Haunted Chocolatier is a similar type of town life sim game where you live in a haunted castle, gathering ingredients, and making chocolates to sell in your very own chocolate shop. Haunted Chocolatier doesn't have a release date yet, but has been confirmed for PC with the intention to bring it to other major platforms too.<br /><br />#IGN #HauntedChocolatier #ConcernedApe{% endraw %}
