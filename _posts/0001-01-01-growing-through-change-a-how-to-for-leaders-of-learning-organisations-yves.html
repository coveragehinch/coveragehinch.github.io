{% raw %}Forward-thinking organisations have earned the title of “learning organisations” as they pioneer ways to keep up with external changes, including globalisation, increased competition and rapid technological advances. This TEDx talk will explore how leaders in these organisations can create optimum conditions to help their teams not only survive, but thrive with change every day.   This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
