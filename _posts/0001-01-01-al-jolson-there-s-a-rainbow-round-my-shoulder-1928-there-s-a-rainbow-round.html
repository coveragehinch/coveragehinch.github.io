{% raw %}There's a Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder<br />(Jolson - Rose - Dreyer)<br />Performed by Al Jolson<br />Recorded September 20, 1928<br />Brunswick 4033<br /><br />Warner Brothers produced many musical films and their biggest star in the late 1920s was, of course, Al Jolson. After Jolson's success in &quot;The jazz Singer&quot; in 1927, he appeared in even a more successful film, &quot;The Singing Fool&quot;. The film was tailored to Jolson's reputation as a singer and it gave him the chance to sing three smash hits, &quot;Sonny Boy&quot;, &quot;I'm Sitting on top of the World&quot; and &quot;There's a Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder.&quot;  With the success of these early talkies, Warners initiated a policy that made songwriting a vital part of the film making process.  The songs introduced in these films almost always assured the commercial success of both sheet music and record sales.{% endraw %}
