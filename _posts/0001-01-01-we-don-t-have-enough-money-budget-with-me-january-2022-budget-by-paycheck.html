{% raw %}This was a tough one to record. But I promised to be opened and honest about our finances. <br /><br />Basically. we don't have enough income. <br /><br />So join me whilst I discuss options to reduce our bills and the consideration of a debt consolidation loan. <br /><br />Thank you for you support ‚ù§ if it wasn't for you guys, I would've hidden myself under a rock and prayed for it to go away! <br /><br />Love <br />Rainbow Budgets üåà <br /><br />#debt #budgeting #debtfreejourney #budget #debtfreecommunity #budgetbypaycheck{% endraw %}
