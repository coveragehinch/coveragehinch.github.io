{% raw %}Hope this was worth the wait! So many people helped with this video: Prof John Sperry, Hank Green, Henry Reich, CGP Grey, Prof Poliakoff, my mum filmed for me in beautiful Stanley Park and Jen S helped with the fourth version of the script.<br /><br />Prof John Sperry <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://biologylabs.utah.edu/sperry/john.html">http://biologylabs.utah.edu/sperry/john.html</a><br />Hank Green (SciShow) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/scishow">http://www.youtube.com/user/scishow</a><br />Henry Reich (minutephysics) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics">http://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics</a><br />CGP Grey <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/cgpgrey">http://www.youtube.com/user/cgpgrey</a><br />Prof Poliakoff (Periodic Videos) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/periodicvideos">http://www.youtube.com/user/periodicvideos</a><br /><br />Also thanks to the Palais de la Decouverte - they helped me with the whole vacuum pump setup in Paris. No, I could not actually suck water up 10m - I did about 4m, but the vacuum pump was easily able to do it and I saw spontaneous boiling on all of our various trials. Footage from this may end up on 2Veritasium.<br /><br />Trees create immense negative pressures of 10's of atmospheres by evaporating water from nanoscale pores, sucking water up 100m in a state where it should be boiling but can't because the perfect xylem tubes contain no air bubbles, just so that most of it can evaporate in the process of absorbing a couple molecules of carbon dioxide. Now I didn't mention the cohesion of water (that it sticks to itself well) but this is implicit in the description of negative pressure, strong surface tension etc.{% endraw %}
