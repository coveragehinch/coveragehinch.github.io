{% raw %}The Lydd Ranges Sea Defence scheme is a major investment being delivered by the Environment Agency in partnership with the Ministry of Defence. Once completed it will help reduce flood risk to homes and businesses in Romney Marsh and along the south Kent coastline. <br /> <br />Work involves the refurbishment and raising of timber groynes, improving the flood defence bank known as the green wall, and recharging the shingle beach. Construction started here in July 2021 and is expected to be completed in 2023.<br /> <br />The video explains how this vital project will be delivered.{% endraw %}
