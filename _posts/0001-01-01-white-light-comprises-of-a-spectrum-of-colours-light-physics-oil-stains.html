{% raw %}Oil stains show rainbow colours for the same reason that a prism disperses white light into seven colours. The reason is that &quot;white&quot; light or sunlight is really the presence of a wide range of colours or frequencies at once. The human brain perceives these signals together as &quot;white&quot;. Different frequencies refract at different angles and by using a prism, we can separate these components to see them as separate colours.{% endraw %}
