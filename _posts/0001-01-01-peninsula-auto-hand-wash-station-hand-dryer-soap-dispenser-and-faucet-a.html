Both the wash basin and the spout of this new hand wash station are crafted aesthetically. <br /><br />The beautifully designed spouts adopt the concept of cuesta (special shape of mountains) which is commonly seen in Northeast Coast of Taiwan. This design adds a little fun to the hand washing experience and will definitely make the washroom design refreshing. The spouts can be PVD processed to different colors. We also obtained the patents of the spout design.<br /><br />The idea of a hand washing or a hand sanitizing station is to make the hand washing process much easier without having to move your steps. It also benefits the building owner and service company as water and soap fall directly to the washbasin instead of floor. The maintenance cost and labor can be easily cut down by installing the hand washing station.<br /><br />We can highly customize Peninsula wash station completely based on your requests. Please feel free to contact us.
