{% raw %}Do you know that the way we see things can reveal nuances about our personality? The way humans see and perceive the world has amazed scientists for centuries.  The human brain does a good job of interpreting and processing information received by the eyes. Today we offer you a set of fun riddles that will let you learn more about yourself and test your vision.<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS: <br />#1 1:00<br />#2 2:38<br />#3 3:25<br />#4 4:03<br />#5 4:44<br />#6 5:24<br />#7 5:55<br />#8 6:27<br />#9 7:06<br />#10 7:38<br />#11 8:21<br />#12 8:47<br /><br />#personalitytype #riddles #personalitytest<br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music">https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music</a><br /><br />SUMMARY: <br />- This first riddle might look like a basic children’s puzzle, but nothing is as simple as it seems here. Look closely, and count how many animals you see in this picture.<br />- If this drawing is a gorilla to you, it characterizes you as an independent person who values personal space and “me time.” Teamwork and asking others for advice can be helpful too.<br />- Do you see a bright explosion? Then you’re a good organizer and a perfect leader. You like to be in charge, and you aren’t afraid to face the music.<br />- If this looks like a village with huts, birds, and trees to you, you value traditions and prefer a simple and peaceful style of life.<br />- If it’s clearly a face to you, you’re most definitely sensitive and kind, which is why you like to avoid conflicts. You have truly phenomenal intuition, and this helps you out in so many situations.<br />- So the creature that doesn’t belong here is a puppy. You don’t eat those, right? But I personally wouldn’t mind a bite of everything else present here. <br />- Are you ready to be amazed? It’s Harry Potter’s best friend. No, not Ron Weasley! The other one — it’s an owl. <br />- It’s a chameleon! By the way, if you think chameleons actually change their color to hide from enemies or danger, you’re wrong.<br />- If you saw a bra, you’re impatient, enjoy every moment, and love a new experience. “You only live once” could be your bumper sticker. Keep going like this for as long as you enjoy it. <br />- If you think it’s A, dark blue, you’re a perfectionist. You’re also independent, analytical, and a high achiever. <br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br /><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
