{% raw %}In Bristol, eagle-eye officer Russ spots a passenger dressed in a suspiciously smart suit making a swift exit. A bag search discovers three kilos of cocaine hidden in the fabric of the case. In Gatwick officers are on the lookout for a passenger previously charged with importing drugs. And in Cornwall, the customs officers aboard Searcher rummage a massive Polish cargo vessel looking for potential smugglers and discover a stash of 10,000 cigarettes. <br /><br />In Gatwick and Bristol Airports in England customs agents check baggage and travellers to uphold allowances and prevent illicit activity and substances from entering the UK. <br /><br />Content owned and licensed from Off The Fence to Little Dot Studios. <br /><br />For all questions, please contact owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com{% endraw %}
