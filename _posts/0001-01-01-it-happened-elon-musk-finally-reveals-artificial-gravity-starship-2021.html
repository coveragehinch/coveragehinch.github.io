And this is thanks to the dogged ambition of Elon Musk. The billionaire is building a mighty spacecraft, the Starship, that will take volunteers across the vast distance between Earth and Mars! However, since the trip will take months in deep space, Musk's company, SpaceX, has to find a way to protect the travelers from the effect of microgravity during the duration of the journey! This is why SpaceX has come up with an artificial gravity Starship! What is this spacecraft, and how does it work?<br />Join us as we explore SpaceX's insane artificial gravity Starship!<br />Regardless of whether you think attempting to go to Mars is foolhardy or is not going to work, Musk is forging ahead with his plans to take people from the Earth to Mars to live there permanently. This is the main reason he is building the Starship, the space rocket that promises to be the most powerful ever built! It will be configurable for carrying humans or cargo.<br />The Starship is unique in several aspects. It is capable of lifting more than 100 tons to orbit, which is necessary given that lots of tons of cargo have to go ahead of the colonizers! This will contain systems that will keep them alive. Remember, Mars is a very harsh environment, and special provisions have to be made. Musk has to supply water, food, materials for constructing shelters, machinery for making rocket fuel, and all the works!<br />SpaceX has designed the Starship to consist of an upper and lower stage. At the point of separation, the lower stage or the Super Heavy booster will return to Earth while the Ship will proceed to Mars after refueling in orbit.<br />To save on cost, both stages of the Starship are completely reusable. The booster returns to the land and is quickly checked out and prepped for the next flight. It will depend on about 30 Raptor engines for propulsion. The Raptor engines are designed and developed by SpaceX. The upper stage will also re-enter the Earth after each mission, with heat resistant tiles protecting it from getting damaged by the heat produced.<br />SpaceX plans to make about a thousand of these starships and launch at least three per day. This will allow Musk to quickly reach his goal of one million people on Mars!<br />Of course, the Starship is not meant for Mars trips alone. NASA plans to use the Starship in its next mission to the moon. The spacecraft will drop the astronauts on the moon's surface and return them to orbit after they complete their missions.<br />As a cargo carrier, the Starship is relatively simple to design. However, when the Starship is meant to transport people, some complications begin to show up.<br />For shorter trips, like to the moon, SpaceX won't have to worry about because this will last several days. However, going from Earth to Mars takes months and exposes the passengers to harmful radiation in the harsh environment that the Starship has to pass. But of course, this particular problem can be fixed by putting shields on the Starship.<br />But one other problem that is not easily solved is gravity. It is an issue that affects astronauts that are not going as far as Mars because they have to keep to a strict regimen of exercise while aboard the International Space Station. Even this is not always enough, as returning astronauts sometimes have to be stretchered out of their spacecraft when they return from months-long missions.<br />Disclaimer:<br />Our videos are made for entertainment purposes only.
