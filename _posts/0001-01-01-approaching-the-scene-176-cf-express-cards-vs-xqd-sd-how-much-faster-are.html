{% raw %}Approaching the Scene 176: CF-Express Cards vs XQD &amp; SD. How Much Faster Are They?<br /><br />(LINKS BELOW) Should you buy a CF-Express card? If so, which one? With the latest bunch of cameras harnessing the speed of CF-Express memory cards, I’ve had a ton of questions lately. My XQD camera will take CF-Express B now, should I buy one? What’s up with the A vs B variants? How fast are they? Which should I buy for my soon to arrive Nikon Z9? Why won’t my XQD reader work with the CF-Express card I just bought? This video will answer all those questions and more.<br /><br />LINKED TABLE OF CONTENTS:<br />00:00 Intro to ATS 176<br />01:24 Join our free December 7th Office Hours and enter our photo contest<br />02:48 Nikon’s Z9 is designed for fast CF-Express B Cards<br />04:06 Not all CF-Express cards can sustain high speeds<br />04:35 SD vs XQD vs CF Express A &amp; B card speeds compared<br />04:48 SD card stats<br />05:59 XQD card stats<br />06:48 CF Express A stats (Sony Only)<br />07:40 CF Express B stats (they need a different reader than XQD)<br />10:16 CF Express B cards have different ‘minimum’ write speeds<br />11:00 For the Z9 minimum write speed matters for buffer depth<br />12:05 Z7ii’s buffer test with SD card<br />13:18 Z7ii’s buffer test with XQD card<br />14:23 Z7ii’s buffer test with slower Gold CF Express B Card<br />15:37 Z7ii’s buffer test with faster Cobalt CF Express B Card<br />17:08 The Z7ii does not really need CF-Express speed<br />17:53 You may not need CF-Express cards yet for your camera<br />18:06 If buying CF-Express B cards.
