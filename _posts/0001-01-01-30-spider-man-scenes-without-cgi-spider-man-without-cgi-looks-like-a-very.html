{% raw %}Spider-Man without CGI looks like a very different movie at times - but what’s particularly impressive is just how much the team actually does - using CGI to enhance effects or remove some of the aids they used on the day. Spider-Man swinging through the concrete jungle that is New York is iconic, but when No Way Home and Far From Home came about, Zendaya did her fair share of flying through the air with her Spider-Man. What we’re all curious about though is how exactly Tom Holland manages to be ok performing while hanging upside down so much! <br />CGI has come a long way and has made a pretty big difference when it comes to certain villains - we’re talking Doc Ock and the Green Goblin! While in their first appearance Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe wore less than comfortable suits featuring hard helmets and puppet arms - their appearances in Tom Holland's Spider-man came with a lot less baggage. Turns out, using CGI outfits can make filming a whole lot comfier for actors! <br />He doesn’t do them all - but Holland does a surprising amount of daring and risky stunts as Spider-Man. CGI was key to making sure everything looked smooth - but with and without CGI some of those shots are totally unrecognizable. Remember a certain scaling of a monument? Since the team wasn’t allowed to film on the actual monument, they made a decent stand-in for Tom to still ACTUALLY scale-up - sure they had to adapt a bit, but they never cut corners. This is some of the best CG there is - so how did they make it happen over the past twenty years? We’ve got all the info you’re looking for! <br /><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Chapters:<br /><br />00:19 Spidey In The Jungle<br />00:41 Upside Down<br />00:58 That’s My Stop<br />01:13 Doctors In The House<br />01:31 On The Run<br />01:46  Pyro Time<br />02:03 Through the Floor<br />02:17 Off Roading<br />02:30 The Snowy Block<br />02:47 In Ruins<br />03:01 Car Sacrifice<br />03:17 Spell Time<br />03:32 Car Hop<br />03:45 Taking To The Streets<br />04:02 London Bridge Bonding<br />04:26 The Elemental Villains<br />04:41 What Ship?<br />04:55 Monumental Scaling<br />05:18 Frozen in Time<br />05:48 Virtual Soaring<br />06:04 Spidey In The Sewers<br />06;19 A Digital Adventure<br />06:46 Stuck with the Symbiote<br />07:12 He’s Back!<br />07:25 On The Web<br />07:48 Eight vs Two<br />08:15 Aunt May’s Adventures<br />08:42 The Train Ride<br />09:11 New York From Scratch<br />09:32 Becoming The Green Goblin<br /><br /><br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/">https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/</a><br /><br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thethings.com">https://www.thethings.com</a><br /><br />Written by: Thalia GK<br />Narrated by: Serena L<br />Edited by: Olena L<br /><br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
