{% raw %}After living with Tesla 2021.44.6 software release for the past week (and also with 2021.44.5), on my Tesla Model Y LR, I give you the nuances and quirks after one week of testing.<br /><br />Sometimes it is best to wait a while before doing a video on a new software release from Tesla. In my Tesla Model Y, I found this release to be quite stable, and it added a couple nice features for Tesla owners. Many owners complained that the previous Tesla version 2021.40.6 introduced additional problems with phantom braking, but I am happy to report improvements with this release!<br /><br />I love the new unlock feature and separate Tesla profiles the best in this software version. That's the big Tesla news for this release. <br /><br />Got a Tesla Model 3 or other Tesla? Let me know in the comments how well this software performed in your car, or if you got additional features. <br /><br />GREAT PRODUCTS<br /><br />Mud flaps (must have for Model Y owners)<br />► CANADA <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3AhtHmx">https://amzn.to/3AhtHmx</a><br />► USA <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jvQcON">https://amzn.to/3jvQcON</a><br /><br />Other Tesla accessories: <br />► CANADA <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3nHqJ3R">https://amzn.to/3nHqJ3R</a> <br />► USA <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2H5CAZB">https://amzn.to/2H5CAZB</a><br /><br />GoPro Cameras and accessories: <br />► CANADA <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2KbgmqT">https://amzn.to/2KbgmqT</a> <br />► USA <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3reTWp1">https://amzn.to/3reTWp1</a><br /><br />By using my Amazon links you are helping to support my channel and future content creation.
