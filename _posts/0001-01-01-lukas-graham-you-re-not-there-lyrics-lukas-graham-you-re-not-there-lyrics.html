{% raw %}Lukas Graham - You're Not There - Lyrics<br /><br />I only got you in my stories<br />And you know I tell them right<br />Remember you and I, when I'm awake at night<br />So give it up for fallen glory<br />I never got to say goodbye<br />I wish I could ask for just a bit more time<br /><br />Every step I take, you used to lead the way<br />Now I'm terrified to face it on my own<br /><br />You're not there<br />To celebrate the man that you made<br />You're not there<br />To share in my success and mistakes<br />Is it fair? <br />You'll never know the person I'll be<br />You're not there<br />With me<br /><br />Though I know that you're not there<br />I still write you all these songs<br />It's like, you still got the right to know what's going on<br />As I struggle to remember how you used to look and sound<br />Sometimes I still think I can spot you in the crowd<br /><br />Every step I take, you used to lead the way<br />Now I'm terrified to face it on my own<br /><br />You're not there<br />To celebrate the man that you made<br />You're not there<br />To share in my my success and mistakes<br />Is it fair? <br />You'll never know the person I'll be<br />You're not there<br />With me<br /><br />Time can heal your wounds if<br />You're strong and standing tall<br />I've been doing all of that, it didn't help at all<br />They say you'll grow older, and it'll get better still<br />Yes, I will, but no it won't<br />They don't get it<br /><br />'Cause you're not there<br />To celebrate the man that you made<br />You're not there<br />To share in my my success and mistakes<br />Is it fair? <br />You'll never know the person I'll be<br />You're not there<br />With me{% endraw %}
