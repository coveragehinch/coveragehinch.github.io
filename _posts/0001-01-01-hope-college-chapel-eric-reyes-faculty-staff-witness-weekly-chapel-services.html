{% raw %}Weekly Chapel services are offered to the entire Hope community on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday’s at 10:30-10:52am in Dimnent Chapel. Please consider making time to worship as a community.  The Campus Ministry team will be preaching through The Sermon on the Mount, with a theme of “Building a Life on the Rock”. Chapel services are also live-streamed on the Hope College YouTube Channel and the Campus Ministries Facebook Page.<br /><br />The Gathering will take place on Sunday nights at 8 p.m. This year they will be exploring the “The Story of: God’s Five Act Play.” They will be traveling through the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, telling the story of God’s dramatic action in the world – that leads from the garden to the city.{% endraw %}
