{% raw %}&quot;You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.&quot;<br />Psalm 23:5<br />—<br />Jesus has prepared a place for you and Him to be in a relationship. A place where you can come to Him and receive the truth of who He says you are. The trouble is that too often there is a third party at our table. The enemy is constantly prowling around waiting for an opening, an invitation from us to pull up a seat and steal, kill, and destroy us.<br />—<br />Here's the good news. Even though the enemy longs to sit at your table, our Good Shepherd has laid down His life to be the only one with a right to sit with us. We are so prized and valued by Jesus that He paid everything to be with us, and we have to make sure that we don't extend that same honor to the Enemy.{% endraw %}
