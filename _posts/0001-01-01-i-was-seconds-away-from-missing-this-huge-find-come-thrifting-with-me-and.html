{% raw %}Come thrifting with me and see the rare thrift store finds I found to sell on eBay, Amazon FBA, and Mercari. My competitor was ahead of me in this thrift store, but missed an obvious bolo. I will be able to sell this online for great profit. I love reselling because you never know what can be in the next Goodwill.<br /><br />//MY RESELLING TOOLBOX<br /><br />Save on Bubble Wrap -<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.americanbubbleboy.com?sca_ref=1257069.PawLDS3PG3">https://www.americanbubbleboy.com?sca_ref=1257069.PawLDS3PG3</a><br /><br />Everything I Use For My Reselling Business -<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LalfeI">https://amzn.to/2LalfeI</a><br /><br />How I Cross List For More Income - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://app.primelister.com/redirect/landing?r=WNJ-337">https://app.primelister.com/redirect/landing?r=WNJ-337</a><br /><br />eBay Store Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ebay.us/tHrxWO">https://ebay.us/tHrxWO</a><br /><br />//WHO AM I?<br /><br />I'm Wick and I am a reseller for a living. I find things at garage sales, thrift stores, and even clearance at retail stores to sell. I do online arbitrage, retail arbitrage, and buy locally. While the majority of my business is done through Amazon FBA, I also sell on eBay or anywhere else I can flip the junk that I find. <br /><br />I also trade stocks and futures, do affiliate marketing, and Merch by Amazon to make money online. My goal is to live a free life away from the typical 9-5 job. <br /><br />Subscribe and join me on my adventures to see what I can find to make some dollars.<br /><br />#reselling #goodwill #thrifting<br /><br /><br />//FOLLOW ME<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/flipping_junk">http://instagram.com/flipping_junk</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/flipping_junk">http://twitter.com/flipping_junk</a><br /><br />//FAQ<br /><br />Q: What Apps do you use to sell online (eBay and Amazon)?<br /><br />A: I search the eBay sold and completed listings to get an idea of what products are selling for. I use the Amazon Seller App to scan for FBA.<br /><br />Q: Can you make a living selling online?<br /><br />A: Yes, the difficulty is based on how much effort you put in and how much you need to make each month. I do this full time.<br /><br />Q: Where do you find your clearance products to resell?<br /><br />A: Literally everywhere. Check end caps and look for clearance aisles, but mostly it will be mixed in. Ask a manager if there's any good clearance deals and build a relationship if possible.<br /><br />Q: Do you make a full-time living selling online?<br /><br />A: I do. All my bills are covered, I'm able to save a good amount, and put money back into the business. I also do other things to make money, but reselling is the meat. It takes a lot of work and dedication to make a full-time living reselling.<br /><br />Please like, comment, and subscribe! It keeps me motivated and happy.
