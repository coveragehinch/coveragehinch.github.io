{% raw %}The most frustrating thing for me is to watch golfers who would like to have consistently solid contact and reasonably accurate ball flight endlessly barking up the wrong tree believing that they have to turn themselves into bio-mechanical &quot;golfing machines&quot; that move through all the right &quot;positions&quot; to get it.<br /><br />So just how is consistent contact and consistent, reasonably consistent ball flight achieved? And how is it that golfers who achieve and elite level of ball striking skill are able to do what they do? How did they learn it?<br /><br />I believe there are two options: Option &quot;A&quot; is a perception that exists in the Golf Culture in every nation on earth where golf is played that great players have figured out how to move their various body parts so as to CAUSE the swinging of the club. This perception is especially prevalent in the modern golf instruction industry. Hence the endless &quot;swing&quot; analysis where great player's &quot;swings&quot; are put on computer screens and all kinds of lines and arrows drawn all over them, pointing out every move them make. Then, the claim is made that these great players contact the ball precisely in the middle of the club face with the club face consistently square at impact BECAUSE of how their bodies move. <br /><br />As you will see in this video, nothing could be further from the truth...{% endraw %}
