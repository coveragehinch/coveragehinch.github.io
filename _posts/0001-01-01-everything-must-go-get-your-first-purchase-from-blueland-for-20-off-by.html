How did we get here?<br />We started living in our van full time in winter of February 2019. We drove across Canada spent 8 months on Vancouver Island working, living and traveling in our van. We then started our dream of overlanding Canada to Argentina. We fell in love with full time travel and van life as we carried on through Canada, USA, Mexico, &amp; Guatemala. However, we couldn't keep overlanding due to the travel restrictions. Over the past year and a half we have drove across Canada showing so many beautiful off- grid camps, national parks and how to live in a van. Now we are embarking on one of the most challenging &amp; exiting projects yet... We are building an off-grid cabin in the woods alone with no experience al the while living in a van! <br /><br />NEW VIDEO EVERY SUNDAY 9:30â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ EST ðŸŒž <br />Make sure you join us as we continue to create van life &amp; cabin life vlogs of our alternative life style.
