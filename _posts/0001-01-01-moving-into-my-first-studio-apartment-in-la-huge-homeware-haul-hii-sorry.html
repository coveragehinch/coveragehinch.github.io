{% raw %}Hii!! Sorry for the long wait, but now it's finally here - my move-in vlog! In this video, I share every step of the process of me moving into my first studio apartment in LA. Of course, I do a little tour of the empty place and show you the &quot;before&quot;. You can also expect a huge homeware haul in this vlog because I had to buy everything from toilet paper to a mattress. I'm very excited to start furnishing and decorating in the upcoming vlogs, so definitely hit that subscribe button if you don't want to miss out! <br /><br />Instagram → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/vvillig">http://instagram.com/vvillig</a><br />Collaborations → victoriavillig.production@gmail.com<br /><br />Question of the day: &quot;What do you think of my nightstands that I built from the Amazon packages?&quot;{% endraw %}
