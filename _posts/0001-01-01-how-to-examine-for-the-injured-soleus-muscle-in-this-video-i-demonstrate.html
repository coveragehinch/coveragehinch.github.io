{% raw %}In this video I demonstrate my approach to isolating out an injured or strained soleus muscle.  Uphill running and long distance running can cause this overuse injury.  However, it can be confused for a gastrocnemius muscle injury unless you isolate it out during the examination.  My demonstrated technique explains how to do that.{% endraw %}
