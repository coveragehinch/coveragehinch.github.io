{% raw %}#Germany <br />Neanderthals were the first to artificially change the world, turning forests into grasslands 125,000 years ago <br />A 125,000-year-old site in Germany known as Neumark-Nord provides the earliest evidence that one of our hominin relatives, the Neanderthals, left lasting imprints on their landscape. Located about 35 km east of Leipzig, Neumark-Nord was filled with small lakes 130,000 to 115,000 years ago when glaciers retreated from Europe. Archaeological evidence suggests that hunting and foraging Neanderthals moved to the area to take advantage of the milder climate during this period and changed their landscape through increased use. These hominins hunted and butchered animals, made tools, gathered firewood, and made bonfires in the Neumark-Nord area for about 2,000 years, which in turn changed local ecosystems during Neanderthal residency, according to Science Advances magazine published Wednesday. <br />“Originally a forest area, the area became open with the arrival of Neanderthals and remained open for about 2,000 years. After they leave, the forest closes again,&quot; said Will Roebroeks, professor of paleolithic archeology at Leiden University in the Netherlands and lead author of the study. Research shows that our species is not the first to change its landscape. Today humans are affecting ecosystems around the world, with serious effects on biodiversity and habitats around the world,&quot; said Katerina Harvati, a paleoanthropologist at Eberhard-Carls-University of Tübingen, who was not involved in the research. The new study &quot;shows the significant impact of human activities on ecosystems, even by small groups of hunters and gatherers, before the arrival of modern Homo sapiens,&quot; she added. <br />&quot;This adds an important aspect to the behavior of early humans (including Neanderthals) that have influenced ecosystems long in the past, although we don't know if it was intentional behavior aimed at creating landscapes and keeping them open,&quot; said Dr. Roebroeks.<br />Archaeologists identified Neumark-Nord for the first time in 1985 as a breeding ground for hominin colonization. Excavations in the late 1990s expanded the site and continued between 2003 and 2008.<br /> To confirm that the presence of Neanderthals actually influenced this landscape 125,000 years ago, Dr' Roebroeks’s group compared the new studies. While studying pollen preserved in lake sediments, the researchers have reconstructed changes in the local flora over time. They found that birch and pine trees initially dominated the landscape, but were replaced with vegetation not typical of a closed canopy forest, around the same time hominins arrived in the area. On 61 hectares of land in Neumark-Nord, researchers found many indications of our ancestors' activity there throughout the year.<br />&quot;Tens of thousands of stone artifacts, hundreds of thousands of bone fragments, the remains of hundreds of animals slaughtered as a result of countless episodes of hunting by Neanderthals, combined with abundant traces of fire,&quot; said Dr. Roebroeks. The study also describes charred seeds, hot stone tools, and burnt wood. He added that the old lakeshore of Neumark-Nord is still &quot;far&quot; from the first village or town. While the Neanderthals who used the area may have been less mobile and likely lived in larger groups, they remained hunters and gatherers who traveled from place to place during this last interglacial period, he said.<br />The other lakes, which are between 20 and 54 km apart, do not have a significant Neanderthal presence. And pollen data show that the closed forests there have continuously dominated the environment. Neumark-Nord and the reference lake are located in the eastern region of the Harz Mountains in Germany, indicating that differences in rainfall or temperature between regions do not explain the differences in their respective landscapes. This suggests a &quot;hominin ecological footprint&quot; at Neumark-Nord, said Dr. Roebroeks, revealed that repeated Neanderthal bonfires and trampling of the area while hunting may have altered the local vegetation there.<br />17/12/21{% endraw %}
