Although there is only circumstantial evidence at this point, online sleuths are keeping their eyes peeled for official word. <br /><br />The Bratz is an American product line of fashion dolls first manufactured by MGA Entertainment in 2001. It turns out that they recently followed not only the Blackpink Official Instagram but also all members as well. If a collaboration actually materializes, no doubt the items would be flying off the shelves. <br /><br />In other Lisa News, Money by Lisa has now spent a total of 8 consecutive weeks at #1 for the Spotify Global Top Kpop Chart. Money is currently at #37 on the Spotify Global Daily Chart with 1.85 million streams from Thursday. It also extends its record as the longest-charting song by a K-pop soloist with 98 days and counting. <br /><br />What do you think of today's Lisa News?
