He then goes on to expound the fundamentals of this “beginning.”<br /><br />While being concise and to-the-point the manual is laid out in the form of a detailed daily timetable providing the reader strong inspiration and much heart-rending counsel.<br /><br />The three sections of this book are on obedience, refraining from disobedience, and the etiquette of companionship with the Creator and with creation.<br /><br />One of Imam al-Ghazali’s final works, it embodies a lifetime of learning, experience, and spirituality and can be taken as an introduction to his larger works.<br /><br />You can also like us on facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/zamzamacademy">https://www.facebook.com/zamzamacademy</a><br />or Follow us on twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/zamzamacademy">https://www.twitter.com/zamzamacademy</a> <br />Our Youtube channel is: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/ZamZamAcademy">https://www.youtube.com/ZamZamAcademy</a> <br /><br />For publications: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.whitethreadpress.com">https://www.whitethreadpress.com</a> <br /><br />Book Distributors:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ghazalibookstore.com">https://www.ghazalibookstore.com</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.meccabooks.com/">http://www.meccabooks.com/</a>{% endraw %}
