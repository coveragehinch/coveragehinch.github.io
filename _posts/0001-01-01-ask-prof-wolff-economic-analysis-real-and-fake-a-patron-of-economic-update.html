{% raw %}A Patron of Economic Update asks:  &quot;A &quot;great&quot; jobs report was released today; the stock market soared. I'm skeptical. I see that of those 531,000 &quot;jobs added,&quot; a great many are in relatively low-wage sectors such as Leisure &amp; Hospitality, Retail, etc. - how many will we learn in January were merely seasonal? Meanwhile, per the report, &quot;the number of permanent job losers, at 2.1 million, changed little in October but is 828,000 higher than in February 2020.&quot; The Workforce participation rate is unchanged. Inflation's up and product is not on store shelves. So how &quot;great&quot; IS this job report and economic health generally?&quot;<br /><br />This is Professor Richard Wolff's video response.<br /><br />Submit your own question to be considered for a video response by Prof. Wolff on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/economicupdate/community.">https://www.patreon.com/economicupdate/community.</a> <br /><br />Ask Prof Wolff is@Democracy At Work production.
