{% raw %}Elon Musk Provides An INSANE NEW Update On The Tesla Cybertruck! Release Date? New Features?<br /><br />Welcome to Tesla Tech Central.

Now let's carry on with the video. Elon Musk on Monday pointed to the challenges stemming from supply chain problems on Cybertruck's production, even though the company has so far avoided a major hit from the crisis that has plagued the global auto industry. &quot;Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare &amp; it's not over!&quot; Musk said in a tweet on Monday,in response to a Twitter users' request on a Cybertruck update. &quot;I will provide an updated product roadmap on next earnings call,&quot; he added. Musk said during Tesla's earnings call in July that he would not necessarily be present at such future events, unless he had something really important to say, indicating that he may have an update on Cybertruck and the company's other products. Tesla unveiled the futuristic electric pick-up truck in 2019 that is made of stainless steel used in rockets. Musk has touted receiving several hundred thousand orders for the Cybertruck when preorders were opened.At a shareholder meeting in October, Musk said Cybertruck production will begin next year and reach volume production in 2023. Elon Musk recently replied to a tweet about the Tesla Cybertruck asking if the truck was going to have a yoke. He said the vehicle will be a technology powerhouse that will be full of futuristic pieces of tech that you didn‚Äôt think could be implemented today - Musk did not elaborate on what tech he was referring to. He didn‚Äôt specifically answer the tweet about the Cybertruck having a yoke, but he didn‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt going to get one (unless he wants to sell this without a means to manually steer). We already know Musk is a fan of the yoke, asking for it to be implemented in production Teslas even though most agree it is not the best idea without a variable steering rack that requires less lock to be applied, so we‚Äôre pretty sure the Cybertruck will get one too. However, Tesla may implement the steer-by-wire system that it is currently developing in the Cybertruck and make it the first vehicle where the yoke will actually not feel like an afterthought.<br /><br />Please leave a like, comment, subscribe, turn the notification bell on and share!<br /><br />Subscribe to our channel to enter our giveawayüéÅ:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvbbwfmoQlgjuLTIpVT3gng">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvbbwfmoQlgjuLTIpVT3gng</a><br /> <br />For all businesses partnership inquiries and for any copyright matters please contact us through our email: teslatechcentral@gmail.com<br /><br />Tags:<br />tesla,cybertruck,cybertruck update,cybertruck update 2021,cybertruck tesla,cybertruck last update,cybertruck update july 2021,cybertruck august 2021,cybertruck fail,cybertruck interior,cybertruck new york,cybertruck test,elon musk,musk,spacex,musk snl,tesla roadster,tesla cybertruck,cybertruck reveal,cybertruck features,cybertruck engineering,cybertruck more update,update cybertruck,cybertruck news,cybertruck news today,cybertruck new design<br /><br />&quot;Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
