{% raw %}This is my take on the outcome and consequences of Brexit. It is not a judgement on how anyone chose to vote. Of course I don't believe that everyone who voted Leave is xenophobic. Nor do I think it's helpful for people with differing views to sling names and insults at each other. All comments welcome, whether you agree with the sentiments or not, but please keep it respectful. Any insulting or offensive comments will be deleted.{% endraw %}
