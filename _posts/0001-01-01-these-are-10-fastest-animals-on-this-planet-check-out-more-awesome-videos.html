Research shows that human beings can run as fast as 40 mph but the sprint speed is approximately 13 mph. <br />However, 13mph sprint is not sufficient to win a race with some of the fastest animals in the world. In the wild, speed is essential for survival. <br />A predator must run faster than its prey or it dies of hunger and the prey must run faster than the predator or it becomes a meal. <br />The slowest animals have to be smart enough to outwit their predators.
