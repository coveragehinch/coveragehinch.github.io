In this video, Daniel answers some of these questions by explaining why Jesus prayed to God if He was God.<br />The answer is found in understanding the Trinity, especially the relationship between God the Father and God the Son and their specific roles. God is One, but three persons with three different roles. We can not compare God to ourselves because He is on a higher level of existence than we are. God the Father and God the Son have always had an amazing relationship and have been communicating with one another since before time began.
