{% raw %}SUBSCRIBE to Truly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj">http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj</a><br /><br />A PLASTIC SURGERY-OBSESSED mum has admitted that her love for looking plastic fantastic has gotten in the way of her parenting at times. 33-year-old Elaina Starr from New York claims she has spent $150,000 on over 500 procedures, including three Brazilian butt lifts, two tummy tucks and a corseting operation, in a bid to achieve her ideal look. Elaina is a single mum to her 11-year-old son, Chaz, who has been worrying about his mum's health because of the procedures. During her last surgery, Elaina suffered from severe health complications and was left bed-bound for months - but she is still 'nowhere near finished' and planning to get her ribs removed in the future. The mum-of-one admits that sometimes she feels guilty about being a plastic mum, even though getting the surgery makes her happy. &quot;I think plastic surgery has impacted, of course, my parenting. There have been times when I had to take extra time to recover,&quot; Elaina told Truly. &quot;As a mum, I'm the best when I'm the happiest and these are the things that make me happy.&quot;<br /><br />Follow Elaina here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/elainastarrxx/">https://www.instagram.com/elainastarrxx/</a><br /><br />Follow Naba (Beautician) here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/moneymakerbeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/moneymakerbeauty/</a><br /><br />Elaina would like to dedicate this video in loving memory of Tristan William Reavis (11/24/2010-9/22/2020).
