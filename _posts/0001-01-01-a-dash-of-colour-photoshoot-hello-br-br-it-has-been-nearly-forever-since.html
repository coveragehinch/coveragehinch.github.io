{% raw %}Hello!!<br /><br />It has been nearly forever since I have uploaded anything, but here is a little BTS of a recent shoot I did with Lili and Pearl. <br /><br />It was SO MUCH fun, with such an amazing team working behind the scenes, we couldnâ€™t have done it without them. <br /><br />(Make sure you take in all of the credits, I recommend every single one of them!)<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this little edit, it gives you a sneak peak of what goes on behind, and in front of the camera, and all of the effort that is put into a massive collaboration like this. <br /><br />Also a MASSIVE thank you to everyone who worked on this shoot, it all paid off with some great results!<br /><br />Head over to my Instagram to see a few of the amazing shots from this day!<br /><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/iamhannahwalsh/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/iamhannahwalsh/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Until next time <br />XX H{% endraw %}
