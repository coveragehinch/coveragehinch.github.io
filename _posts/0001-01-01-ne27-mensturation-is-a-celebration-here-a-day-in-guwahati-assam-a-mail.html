{% raw %}A mail that we received in the morning made us plan our Guwahati exploration much easier. After reading a special mail from one of our subscribers we decided to visit Kamakhya temple which is one of the iconic destination in Assam. This is one of the most important temple in Assam too. <br /><br />After experiencing Kamakhya temple we took a bus to Fancy bazar a busy market in Guwahati. We tried Guwahati puchkas also known as Guwahati pani puris which is really famous for it's street experience and taste. <br /><br />Took a visit to Guwahati ropeway which is India's longest river crossing ropeway and later to Umananda Ghat boat riding. Evening near Brahmaputra are always awesome and special. Later by night we visited one the well known restaurant in Guwahati for Assamese cuisine Michinga to try out their Assamese Thali. Michinga is also known for their Naga cuisine in Guwahati. Michinga Assamese thali and Naga thali was extremely delicious.<br /><br />üî•üî•INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2VzQ2da">http://bit.ly/2VzQ2da</a> üî•üî•<br /><br />------------------üí•MOST POPULAR PLAYLISTSüí•------------------<br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è Backpacking North East India (Travel Series): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3cHbVyt">https://bit.ly/3cHbVyt</a><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è üöó‡¥ï‡¥æ‡µº ‡¥≤‡µà‡¥´‡µç ‡¥á‡¥®‡µç‡¥§‡µç‡¥Ø ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥∞‡¥ø‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡µç (Travel Series): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/37SlWYj">https://bit.ly/37SlWYj</a><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‡¥π‡¥£‡¥ø‡¥Æ‡µÇ‡µ∫ ‡¥á‡µª ‡¥§‡¥æ‡¥Ø‡µç‚Äå‡¥≤‡µª‡¥°‡µç: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2IaBw3F">http://bit.ly/2IaBw3F</a><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‡¥≠‡¥ï‡µç‡¥∑‡¥£‡¥Ç - ‡¥í‡¥∞‡µÅ ‡¥µ‡µÄ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥®‡µÜ‡¥∏‡µç: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/39aNZjE">http://bit.ly/39aNZjE</a><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‡¥Ø‡¥æ‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞ ‡¥Ö‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡µΩ: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2PHellM">http://bit.ly/2PHellM</a><br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏èSupport Our Work‚ù§Ô∏è: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3rbhJ8N">http://bit.ly/3rbhJ8N</a><br /><br />üéµ Where we find our music:<br />Epidemic Sound.
