{% raw %}Representative Bennie Thompson, Chairman of the House select committee investigating the insurrection, announced that he has signed 20 new subpoenas to obtain evidence relevant to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. However, the problem isn't the issuance of subpoenas, it's the enforcement of congressional subpoenas.  <br /><br />More than two weeks ago, Congress referred Steve Bannon to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution for contempt of Congress. Every day that Bannon goes unindicted is another day the DOJ sends the signal that witnesses need not take congressional subpoenas serious. <br /><br />This video discusses the concerns and consequences of DOJ not indicting Bannon in a timely manner.{% endraw %}
