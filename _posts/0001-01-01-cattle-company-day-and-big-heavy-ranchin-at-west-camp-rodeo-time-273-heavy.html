Dale Brisby is a legendary bull riding gypsy soul that is always on to the next one! He crawls outta bed the same way he crawls into the bucking chute, ready to keep it 90! He loves spurring big brahmer necks for big money checks. you can find him at the pay window, behind the bucking chutes, in the chute, or even busting broncs and tearing down honky tonks! He's been 90 in Maine, Spain, Spokane, and Ala-bame! Thank you for taking a moment to enjoy his shenanigans on the road, at a rodeo, or at home at Radiator Ranch! We all know that one guy who's always playin. You find yourself wondering every time he opens his mouth if its a serious story or another joke. You think to yourself, &quot;You play too much! But it is funny. And you're good looking. And I want to name my kid after you. And you're a legend. And I want you to kiss my wife on the mouth!&quot; Well that guy is me! Sometimes when I open my mouth, I don't even know if what I'm about to say is credible, so I can't imagine how you feel! However, if it isn't true, it otta be! Thanks again for joining!{% endraw %}
