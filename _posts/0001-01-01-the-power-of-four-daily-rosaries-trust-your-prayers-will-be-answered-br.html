{% raw %}Trust your prayers will be answered!<br /><br />What a testimony from Mom of 7 Gina Huston. Especially on our last day of the peace challenge. She encourages to start with your biggest intentions/challenges/messes first and watch Our Lady take these requests to her Son and they will be answered. <br /><br />Gina also pointed out that if she does commit to the praying the 4 rosaries every day it can’t be perfect, but she knows I’m trying. Mary knows what is in your heart. <br /><br />“When I need help, She helps me.”<br /><br />What is your biggest intention? <br /><br />At Manyhailmarysatatime our intention is to encourage the rosary prayer and let Our Lady lead the mission into the arms of love with Heaven on Earth. To love without limits!<br /><br />4 Rosaries video link below <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfyk53nrDzc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfyk53nrDzc</a>{% endraw %}
