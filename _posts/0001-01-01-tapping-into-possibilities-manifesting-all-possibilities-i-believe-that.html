{% raw %}I believe that if there is something your heart and soul desire enough - it is possible. The things on your Vision Board, the big goals and dreams - they are all possible.<br />However we can become stuck and blocked as to the next action steps to take to make our dreams a reality. This round of tapping has been created with the intention of helping you flip the switch so that you start thinking in terms of possibility, to help you think more creatively so that inspiration begins to flow again.<br />When the inspiration flows - TAKE ACTION!<br /><br />üî¥  GET TAPPING SOLUTIONS by subscribing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MelanieMooreEFT?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/MelanieMooreEFT?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è SHARE THIS VIDEO with someone you care about:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/VWTDMyJfgvU">https://youtu.be/VWTDMyJfgvU</a><br /><br />‚ú≥Ô∏è  COME AND JOIN the FREE Facebook group community and share your experiences:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/tappingintoyourbigvision">https://www.facebook.com/groups/tappingintoyourbigvision</a><br /><br />üôå Work with me - find out how <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.melaniemoore.co.uk/courses/">https://www.melaniemoore.co.uk/courses/</a> <br /><br /><br />üôè  Welcome to Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) by Melanie Moore, a series where I try to help you with issues in your life using tapping therapy.  <br />If you have suggestion for the next tapping solution leave your comment below.<br /><br />Typical legal disclaimer:  EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques) is a type of energy therapy that provides impressive results for most people, but there is no guarantee of such results.  These techniques may not be successful in all cases, and may occasionally cause some emotional discomfort in certain individuals. While EFT has produced remarkable clinical results, it is still considered to be in the experimental stage. By participating in the sessions (videos) you agree to the following statements:<br />‚ÄúI understand that I will be introduced to Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), also known as Meridian Tapping or Tapping.  EFT Tapping is a technique considered to be a type of energy therapy.  Due to the experimental nature of EFT Tapping, and because it is relatively new healing approach and the extent of its effectiveness, as well as its risks and benefits, are not fully known or understood, I agree to assume and accept full responsibility for any and all risks associated with using EFT Tapping both during and after any session or workshop, including responsibility for my own emotional, physical, and mental health and wellbeing.
