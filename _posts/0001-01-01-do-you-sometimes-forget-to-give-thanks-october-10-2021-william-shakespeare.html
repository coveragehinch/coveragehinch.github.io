{% raw %}William Shakespeare had this to say about the sin of ingratitude: “I hate ingratitude more than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, or any cant of vice whose strong corruption inhabits our frail blood.” Perhaps there are greater sins than the sin of ingratitude, but I don’t believe there is an uglier sin than the sin of ingratitude.{% endraw %}
