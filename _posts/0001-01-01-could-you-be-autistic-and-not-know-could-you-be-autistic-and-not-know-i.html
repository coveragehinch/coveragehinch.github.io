{% raw %}Could you be autistic and not know? I, and many other autistic adults with a late diagnosis of autism, will tell you - YES!<br /><br />The current model of autism diagnosis is predicated on the assumption that autism traits will make themselves seen in early childhood. In fact, it is often thought of as a childhood disorder. But the amount of late diagnosed autistic adults means that clearly this model is missing something and instead of an outside-in approach we need to start thinking about an inside-out approach - listening to the internal experiences of autistic people, rather than having neurotypical researchers describe what they think they see.<br /><br />WATCH NEXT: Autism diagnosis criteria explained <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/1yva4RZW_s0">https://youtu.be/1yva4RZW_s0</a><br /><br />If you think this describes you like no one has ever described you before - here are some further resources. Please note, relating to all these points DOES NOT mean you are definitely autistic - there are many other conditions that it could be, so please see a professional if you're concerned.<br /><br />Autism Quotient (AQ) test:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://psychology-tools.com/test/autism-spectrum-quotient">https://psychology-tools.com/test/autism-spectrum-quotient</a><br /><br />Women on the spectrum checklist<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://the-art-of-autism.com/females-and-aspergers-a-checklist/">https://the-art-of-autism.com/females-and-aspergers-a-checklist/</a><br /><br />👩‍💻To join my Discord server for exclusive content, perks, community and giveaways, please go to my Ko-Fi page and sign up for the Monthly option: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/yosamdysam">https://ko-fi.com/yosamdysam</a> 👩‍💻<br />(☕If you like my content and just want to “tip” me, you can buy me a single Ko-Fi ☕)<br /><br /><br />🔀All my autism videos in one handy playlist 🔀: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfWrZJcC_lTAJvhgia_UqpidfyNARkPCN">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfWrZJcC_lTAJvhgia_UqpidfyNARkPCN</a> <br />👭 Autism in women/girls playlist 👭: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfWrZJcC_lTDCKsfwEtLNWq96OgYHqA-b">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfWrZJcC_lTDCKsfwEtLNWq96OgYHqA-b</a> <br />🐦My Twitter 🐦: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Samantha_Stein">https://twitter.com/Samantha_Stein</a><br />📷My Instagram 📷: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/yosamdysam/">https://www.instagram.com/yosamdysam/</a><br />✉ SIGN UP TO MY MAILING LIST ✉: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.subscribepage.com/yosamdysam">https://www.subscribepage.com/yosamdysam</a>{% endraw %}
