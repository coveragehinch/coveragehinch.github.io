{% raw %}Terrible Explosion : La Palma Volcano Eruption Canary Islands Spewing Giant black Lava<br /><br />Intense ash emissions, no end in sight despite decrease of quakes.<br /><br />Eruptive activity remains elevated, dominated by strong ash emissions reaching up to 18,000 ft (5.5 km) altitude today, but fortunately drifting west over the Atlantic ocean and sparing the airport. Local sources reported loud explosions could be heard over night. <br /><br />The eruption has been becoming increasingly &quot;ashy&quot;, or explosive, at least when it comes to what can be seen at the vents,<br />At the active cone, the emission of incandescent, fluid lava by fountaining and lava flows is less intense compared to previous days, but volcanic tremor remains very high, suggesting that the effusion rate has not dropped. <br /><br />The most likely explanation is not that activity has decreased, but that most of the fluid lava erupted is diverted directly into a lava tube system and mostly remains hidden from view, until it emerges somewhere downslope to feed surface flows on top of older flows or create new active flow tongues along its margins.<br /><br />#Lapalma #Volcano #IGME #ING #Cumbrevieja #Spain #Canaryisland #VOA #THESUN #DW #TVE #Guardiacivil #Globalnews #Skynews{% endraw %}
