{% raw %}youtu.be/IHXg4dk7Npk - Hydraulic pump build<br />youtu.be/8c-MhvQiYjI- Hydraulic Control Valve - Conversion<br />So far, it is the largest and most complex project we have ever done.<br />As you can see in the video, it is not 100% finished yet, but it is already working and driving. In the next video we will try to show you the completely finished and painted project and show you a longer test and all the functions of this vehicle.<br /><br />As a drive, I used worm gear motors that come from a broken wheelchair.<br />Each of them has 150 watts, and thanks to the additional chain transmission, the wheels have a very high strength.<br />The drive wheel has 10 teeth and the take-up wheel has 43 teeth.<br />The chassis frame is made of high-strength materials, most of the wall thickness is 3 and 4 mm.<br />12V 100ah gel batteries are connected in series to give 24V<br />In order for the switches for driving and control to last a long time, I decided to use relays.{% endraw %}
