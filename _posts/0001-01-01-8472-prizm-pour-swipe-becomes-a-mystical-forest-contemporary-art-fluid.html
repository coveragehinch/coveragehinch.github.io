I strongly recommend adding GAC 800 by Golden as an addition to all colors (25%) to avoid crazing. <br /><br />I am using dominantly Prism pour colors. These acrylic paints are mixed with Vivid Poly Pour available from Colour Arte, both extend and help them flow more easily. My Prism Pour recipe currently is 2/3 Vivid Poly Pour with Gac 800 (25%)add 1/3 color, mix well. <br /><br />When I am using a cell accelerator to create a blooming effect, the paint will be Amsterdam black (mixed with my usual pouring medium mixture)with 10 drops of Minwax pre-stain wood conditioner added for every 2 ounces of mixed paint. <br /><br />A propane torch is cautiously passed over the surface of the canvas to release any air in the paint that might result in bubbles forming while the artwork dries or leaving pockmarks if left to pop on their own. Warming the paint will also often encourage patterns to emerge because the paint in combination with the American Floetrol used in my pouring mix encourages cells to form. I advise a well-ventilated room and those with respiratory issues to avoid or use a respirator.<br /><br /> Mixing colors always depends on the viscosity and color saturation of the acrylic paint used, so the amounts of color needed will vary. I like to begin with half pouring mixture and half color. After that is mixed thoroughly, I add more pouring mixture until the viscosity (thickness) is like warm hone. If I want it thinner, I add more Pouring mixture. If the color is not strong enough, I add more pigment. When mixing colors, my amounts are always estimated and then altered to get the right consistency I like. The consistency is usually medium &quot;body&quot; weight, but other weights are usable with minor adjustments. All my acrylic paints are mixed in advance and contained and stored in squeeze bottles. If you are not using squeeze bottles, I suggest using a container that has a tight-fitting lid or seals the container with Glad sticky wrap. I mix paint colors using plastic squeeze bottles (with measurements on the side whenever possible. I add a marble into the bottle to aid in the mixing process. Marbles work well but exercise caution if you end up with more than one because they will shatter in the mixture eventually. It's imperative (Important) that all mixture be shaken thoroughly again before using in any session every time! Wrap<br /><br /><br /> Every day I learn new things. I will never stop experimenting, and I am happy to share what I discover with you.
