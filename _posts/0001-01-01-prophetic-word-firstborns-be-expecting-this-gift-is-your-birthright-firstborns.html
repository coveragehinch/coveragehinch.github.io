I realize that I am a sinner and I come to repent and ask for forgiveness of my sins. I believe that you died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn away from my sins and ask that you to come into my heart and life. I will trust and follow you as my Lord and Savior. I confess with my mouth that I am saved by the blood of Jesus and Jesus is now my Lord and Savior. In Jesus name, AMEN.{% endraw %}
