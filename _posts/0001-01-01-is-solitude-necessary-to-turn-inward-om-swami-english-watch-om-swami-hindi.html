The first part of the discourse is on turning inwards.<br />Om Swami says that one needs to turn inward to discover the self-sufficiency within themselves, without looking for it in the outside world constantly to feel fulfilled. To go within is to look at oneself for answers and to know that one is responsible for their own thoughts, actions and feelings, he says.<br />The second part of the discourse was on- If solitude was necessary to turn inward?<br />Om Swami says that the more one goes within, the more will they crave for solitude. The outside world though very attractive and delightful can drain a person. Turning inward is healing but a longer solitude is only for a trained mind, he says. It cannot be done forcefully, as the mind not trained properly may get very depressed, he says.<br /><br /><br />Listen to the discourse fully to get an in-depth understanding of this beautiful topic.<br /><br />Timeline:<br />00:00 Start<br />00:32 What is the idea behind going inward?<br />01:50 Should we look for all answers within<br />ourself?<br />02:55 What is the nature of the outside world?<br />05:45 What did Bhairavi Ma tell Om Swami?
