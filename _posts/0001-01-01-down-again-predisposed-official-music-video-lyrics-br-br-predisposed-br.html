{% raw %}Lyrics<br /><br />Predisposed<br /><br />Started out just a thought<br />Creeping from the corners that I’ve never explored before<br />Ready or not<br />It caught my attention and made it’s way down to my core<br />Now I can’t sleep at night<br />Tossing and turning, I’m at war inside my own mind<br />Now I can’t turn it off (make it stop)<br />Maybe I’m trying to be something that I’m not<br /><br />Is there anything good left<br />In my decrepit chest<br />Feel the rot taking hold<br />Splintered wood, crumbled stone<br />Is there anything good left<br />Am I wasting breath<br />Is this decay, never ending<br /><br />I was always so proud<br />In life’s competition there was no one better around<br />Now I’m letting you down<br />Is there beauty in a tree that’s fallen to the ground<br />Have I always been this way<br />Can I pinpoint the mistake<br />That caused me to become everything that I hate<br />Am I a fucking fake<br />Was it all a masquerade<br />Have I been trying to hide what truly lies beneath<br /><br />Is there anything good left<br />In my decrepit chest<br />Feel the rot taking hold<br />Splintered wood, crumbled stone<br />Is there anything good left<br />Am I wasting breath<br />Is this decay, never ending<br /><br />There is no devil on my shoulder<br />There is no evil in my ear<br />This monster grew in the darkest corners<br />Now it’s voice is all I hear<br />Predisposed, is it in my DNA<br />Has our Lord damned me, condemned to be this way<br />The darkness gnawing, begging to be set free<br />But now I realize that the darkness is me<br /><br />I’m not well<br />Can’t help myself<br />Got secrets that I’ll never tell<br />I’m not well<br />No soul to sell<br />God helps those who help themself{% endraw %}
