In fact, the work was written only in two days. On the evening of 17 January 2019 I sketched out the first 5 bars of the work as fully orchestrated score on paper. On the following day I couldn’t return to the sketch due to the urgent study duties at the Lahti conservatory, but in the morning of 19 January, an intense composing process was continued and the work was finished in the afternoon of 20 January 2019. Especially at the beginning there was a strong need to write the music. What still is an astonishment, is that apart from the brief sketch mentioned  above,  no sketches were needed to construct  and finalize the work, the music literally seemed to be given to me. The world premiere performance took place on 20 March 2019 at the Church of the Cross (Ristinkirkko), Lahti, performed by the soprano Janina Mäyry, I conducted Ensemble de Ton Celéste (formed exclusively for the occasion). As a whole, the work made a deep impression on the audience present at the concert. A positive feedback has been given also afterwards by many. ’Do not let your hearts be troubled’ is a meditative work from deep sorrow and hopelessness to ultimate bliss and joy, the Bible verses from the Gospel of John were selected by the author. Musically the work pays a tribute to the composer Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), well-known for his great religious works, St. John  Passion, BWV245, St. Matthew Passion, BWV244 and Mass in B minor, BWV232. The second section of the work in D major is stylistically more inspired by the music of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy (1809-1847). The work is intended to give consolation for those who mourn and hope for those who feel despair and anxiety. The ending underlines from whom we should seek for the ultimate solution to all our troubles; the help comes from God the Creator and we should only trust in Him.{% endraw %}
