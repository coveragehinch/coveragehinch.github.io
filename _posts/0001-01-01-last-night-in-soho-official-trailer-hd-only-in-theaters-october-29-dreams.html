{% raw %}Dreams really do come true. From the imagination of Edgar Wright, #LastNightInSoho is only in theaters October 29.<br /><br />In acclaimed director Edgar Wrightâ€™s psychological thriller, Eloise, an aspiring fashion designer, is mysteriously able to enter the 1960s where she encounters a dazzling wannabe singer, Sandie. But the glamour is not all it appears to be and the dreams of the past start to crack and splinter into something far darker.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lastnightinsohomovie/">https://www.instagram.com/lastnightinsohomovie/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/lastnightinsoho">https://twitter.com/lastnightinsoho</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/lastnightinsoho/">https://www.facebook.com/lastnightinsoho/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.focusfeatures.com/last-night-in-soho">https://www.focusfeatures.com/last-night-in-soho</a><br />www.lastnightinsohodates.com{% endraw %}
