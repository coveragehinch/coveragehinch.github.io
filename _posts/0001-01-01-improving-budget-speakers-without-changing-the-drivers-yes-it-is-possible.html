{% raw %}I improve the sound of one of my cheap Yamaha HTIB front surrounds without swapping drivers out. Changes include a crossover instead of a bass blocker, poly stuffing, and sealing off the bass ports, which were not tuned well. I then compare it with an identical unmodified speaker. The changes to the speaker were temporary because the crossover and stuffing were from a higher quality speaker I wanted to keep original.{% endraw %}
