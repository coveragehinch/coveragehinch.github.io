Many find the frequencies useful for chronic fatigue, or to compensate for sleep deprivation. Wear headphones and adjust your volume to a comfortable level. <br /><br />Download the MP3: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.binauralbeatshub.com/?product=vita-pro">http://www.binauralbeatshub.com/?product=vita-pro</a><br /><br />The binaural begins at low-beta and ramps slowly up to mid-beta, where it settles for 5 mins. It then drops down to Alpha for a while in order to give your mind a short rest. At this point, you can stop listening, or continue onto the next phase which will ascend to a higher beta-state. The isochronic tones will ensure a relaxed as well as alert state of mind.<br />---<br /><br />These audios should not be used as a replacement for the care of your physician.<br /><br />---<br /><br />focus, concentration{% endraw %}
