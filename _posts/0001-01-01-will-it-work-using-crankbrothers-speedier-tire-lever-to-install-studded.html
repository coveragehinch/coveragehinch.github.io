{% raw %}In this video, I install two studded winter tires on my bicycle. An Instagram follower recommended the Crankbrothers Speedier Tire Lever for installs of difficult bicycle tires. I bought the lever some time ago and was looking forward to using it on my winter tire swap. Did it go according to plan? Was the Crankbrothers Speedier Tire Lever helpful? Or did my fingers pay the price? <br /><br />#SchwalbeWinter #45nrthGravdal #bicycletireinstallation #bicycletyreinstallation #bikemechanics<br /><br />________________<br /><br />ðŸš² Winter Tires<br />Front: 45North Gravdal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://45nrth.com/products/gravdal-700c">https://45nrth.com/products/gravdal-700c</a><br />Back: Schwalbe Winter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.schwalbetires.com/bike_tires/road_tires/winter">https://www.schwalbetires.com/bike_tires/road_tires/winter</a><br /><br />ðŸ”§ Tools<br />Crankbrothers Speedier Tire Lever: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZYfLR3">https://amzn.to/2ZYfLR3</a><br /><br />ðŸŽµ Music<br />I download my music from Artlist.
