{% raw %}My debut single, “Therapy” is OUT NOW!<br /><br />Forgive me for not picking up<br />I just think I’ve heard enough<br />I’m sure you’ve got a lot to say<br />But I’m all out of rainy days<br />You only thought about yourself<br />While you were putting me through hell<br />You didn’t notice and you know it <br />So I’m giving me some<br /><br />Therapy <br />Taking back the time you took away from me<br />People always told me you were bad for me don’t mad at me<br />While I take a little time to focus on my<br />Recovery<br />Do a little personal discovery<br />Who I am now that you got piece of me so baby let me be<br />I gotta get through a little therapy  <br /><br />Drinkin’ less and sleeping more<br />Found who I was lookin’ for <br />This new me and you don’t get to see<br />Cause baby I’m lovin this<br /><br />Therapy <br />Taking back the time you took away from me<br />People always told me you were bad for me don’t mad at me<br />While I take a little time to focus on my<br />Recovery<br />Do a little personal discovery<br />Who I am now that you got piece of me so baby let me be<br />I gotta get through a little therapy  <br /><br />Better than before <br />Thanks for nothing boy<br />Didn’t need your help<br />Did it by myself in therapy<br /><br />Therapy <br />Taking back the time you took away from me<br />People always told me you were bad for me don’t mad at me<br />While I take a little time to focus on my<br />Recovery<br />Do a little personal discovery<br />Who I am now that you got piece of me so baby let me be<br />I gotta get through a little therapy{% endraw %}
