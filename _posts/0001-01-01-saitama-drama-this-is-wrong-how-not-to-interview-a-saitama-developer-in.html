I have a hyper competitive drive &amp; always strive to give the best content and look after my viewers in the same light as I would my friends. <br /><br />In this channel you'll find all things crypto-related that I feel is HOT and ready to do well. Of course, always DYOR before you get into a project as these are my opinions and should be taken with a grain of salt.{% endraw %}
