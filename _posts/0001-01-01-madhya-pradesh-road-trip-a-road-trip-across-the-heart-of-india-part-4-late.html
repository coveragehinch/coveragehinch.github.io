{% raw %}Late upload . I was travelling and did not have a stable internet connection.<br />As previously mentioned safaris can be booked online from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forest.mponline.gov.in/eBrochure/eBrochureDetails.aspx?parkid=3.">https://forest.mponline.gov.in/eBrochure/eBrochureDetails.aspx?parkid=3.</a> <br />Cost of Safari booking is INR 2600 . Apart from this one also has to pay about 3K INR for Gypsy and guide charges. <br />There are plenty of resorts and hotels in Panna and Bandhavgarh but it is advisable to book them online to avoid last minute rush,<br />Hope you have enjoyed the video .{% endraw %}
