{% raw %}“You can’t change other people. You can only change yourself.” It's a truism. Only it’s not true. <br /><br />In fact, if you’re a leader or a manager in an organization - if you’re a coach - you have to change other people. It’s your job. If you’re a parent, it’s your job too. And if you care about the people in your life who aren’t reaching their potential or, worse, are acting in self-destructive ways, it’s your longing. <br /><br />The problem isn’t that you can’t change other people, the problem is that the things you do and say to try to change them don’t work because you’re doing and saying the wrong things. In fact, most likely you’re having the opposite effect. <br /><br />What does work? That’s the focus of this session. We’ll look at the 4 fundamentals that need to exist for people to make sustainable change, and we’ll share the Four Steps - the straightforward, methodical, and replicable process for reliably helping other people change.<br /><br />Takeaways from this event include:<br /> • Understand why it’s been so difficult to help other people change - and what we typically do that makes it even harder.<br /> • Identify the 4 powers people need to make sustainable change.<br /> • Learn the Four Steps - the straightforward and replicable process for reliably helping other people change.{% endraw %}
