{% raw %}Breaking! Iran Tests Nuclear Bomb Against Israel! Secret Nuclear Weapon Launches Before Meeting US! Israel has long been wary of a nuclear-capable Iran and sees the country as an existential threat. Israel has repeatedly said it will use military force if necessary to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Starting from Syria's Iraqi border and slowly moving to the south, Iran experienced serious crises with Russia, the USA and Israel in many different areas. It even hit many US bases in the region and assassinated many Syrian regime army commanders who supported Russia. Israel's secret service Mossad has recently prepared very serious reports to Israel, reporting the positions and progress of both the nuclear facilities within the Iranian borders and the Iranian-backed militant headquarters in Syria. Israel has been carrying out intensive offensive and defensive exercises in the region for the last 2 weeks. In addition to the exercises with many allied countries, Israel's ground forces and the IDF organize strategic exercises in the region and revive war scenarios. The commander of the IRGC's Air Force stated that Iranian drones have become a &quot;thorn in the side&quot; of Iran's enemies. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) Aerospace Force, warned on Thursday that if Israel starts a conflict, Iran will “destroy” it, according to Iranian media. “The Zionist regime officials know that they can be the initiators, but the end is with us,” said the commander. “The end of this work is the destruction of the Zionist regime, and if they give us an excuse... their destruction will certainly be advanced historically.” Hajizadeh said that Israel is the only country in the world that talks about its own survival and continued existence. Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Baqeri Kani said the talks will be attended by officials from the US, Russia, China, UK, France and Germany. US State Department Spokesman Ned Price said that a deal could be reached if Iran’s representatives were “serious.” If Iran were only spreading chaos across four countries in the region, that would be bad enough. But it also traffics in rockets, ballistic missiles, drones and precision guided munitions from Iraq and Syria to Lebanon. Israel’s drill this week to prepare for a{% endraw %}
