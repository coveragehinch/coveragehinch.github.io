{% raw %}Moving to an english only channel, please follow <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZFXNO-uU2r4">https://youtu.be/ZFXNO-uU2r4</a><br /><br />In this video I try to answer all the questions people asked me about how to play Imagzle, i.e .:<br />is there a correct way to play Imagzle? how should I play? In what order should the worlds be made? in what order should the levels be made? is the game increasingly hard?<br /><br />ITunes download link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1447476948&amp;mt=8">https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1447476948&amp;mt=8</a><br /><br />Google Play Download: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imagzle">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imagzle</a><br /><br />Suggest a level <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.imagzle.com/en/suggest">https://www.imagzle.com/en/suggest</a><br /><br />What are the easiest levels? What are the most difficult levels? Why is Imagzle so easy? Why is Imagzle so hard? Why is the creator of Imagzle so evil? To solve the levels, do I have to search on Google? Why is it more difficult if I use another search engine? can I use Google images? Why am I stuck on the world of the night? What are the optional levels? Why am I stuck in the world of light? How do I search for level solutions? Why is the first level of the world of light so hard? what are the easiest worlds of Imagzle? How to understand the search field? Do i have to pay attention to the title?<br />And then ... let's move on to the tips on how to solve the levels!<br />First of all: if you use a search engine like DuckDuckgo that does not do profiling, you will not be &quot;listed&quot; as an Imagzle player and therefore the game will be more difficult because you will not have your own bubble. This is not to say that you can't use a search engine other than Google, I'm just warning you that it will be more difficult.<br />In any case: use google or any other search engines correctly! When you discover a new level, start by putting the first words that come to mind on Google images and shake the images, sometimes a mechanism is triggered that will help you a lot in the solution. Use quotes to search for words together, use minus to remove words that don't interest you and that proliferate in your search results. If it gives you too many synonyms or declensions of a name, then you must select Verbatim in the search options and it will only give you results with exactly what you are looking for.<br />Then, once you've hit the search engines, why don't you take advantage of your friends and family as well? We all have in our family or in our circles of acquaintances the expert ornithologist, the philatelic enthusiast and the obsessive cinephiles, dog lovers and music lovers. Why not asking them? Because Imagzle is also this, sharing, socialization and discovering.<br />So, have fun for now, don't stop playing at the first hitch and I'll wait for you among the Chosen<br />See you soon<br />The Developer (of Imagzle).{% endraw %}
