{% raw %}This video answers the question: What is impulsivity? Impulsivity is an interesting construct - it's associated with a number of diagnostic classifications (mental disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual). Some of these mental disorders have impulsivity directly as a symptom and for others impulsivity is really just more of an associated characteristic. We see that with clinical and non-clinical populations - so individuals who have mental disorders and are being treated and individuals who don't - impulsivity has a negative impact on social adjustment, work, school success as well as physical and mental health. We know that impulsivity increases the risk of engaging a lot of behaviors that are considered problematic in our society: gambling, risky sex, substance use, suicidal behavior, binge eating, aggression, and violence.<br /><br />There is single definition for impulsivity, but rather we see a number of terms associated with impulsivity like lack of forethought, risk-taking, inattention, lack of control, failing to plan, excitement seeking, novelty seeking, and quick decision-making.<br /><br />One popular way of understanding impulsivity is the four-factor model called the UPPS model. This acronym stands for urgency, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, and sensation-seeking.<br /><br /><br />Berg, J. M., Latzman, R. D., Bliwise, N. G., &amp; Lilienfeld, S. O. (2015).
