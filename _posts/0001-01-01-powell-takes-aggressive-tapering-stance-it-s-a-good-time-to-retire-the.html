{% raw %}Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell took on a more hawkish stance as he testified before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. Powell talked about a more aggressive tapering approach and highlighted problematic inflation.<br /><br />Powell revealed that the U.S. central bank would consider wrapping up its tapering of asset purchases a few months earlier.<br /><br />&quot;At our next meeting, it is appropriate for us to discuss whether to wrap up our asset purchases a few months earlier,&quot; he said. &quot;We've seen elevated inflation pressures, strong labor market data, and strong spending data. Every dollar of asset purchases does increase accommodation. The U.S. economy is strong and inflationary pressures are high.&quot;<br /><br />Powell also stated that it is best to drop the term &quot;inflation is transitory,&quot; adding that the risk of more persistent inflation is higher.<br /><br />Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testified alongside Powell, stressing the debt ceiling issue and warning that failure to act in time would lead to a deep recession.<br /><br />__________________________________________________________________<br />Kitco News is the world’s #1 source of metals market information.
