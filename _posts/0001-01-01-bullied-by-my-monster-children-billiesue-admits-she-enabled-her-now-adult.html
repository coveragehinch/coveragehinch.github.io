{% raw %}BillieSue admits she enabled her now adult children, Alex and Hana, so badly that it’s akin to child abuse. She says her enabling turned them into hateful, disrespectful menaces to society! She claims her son, Alex, “bullied” her out of her house, and then Hana nearly got her evicted from her apartment. Alex and Hana deny any wrongdoing and claim it’s their mother who has transformed into a “mean, anxiety-riddled mess.” But BillieSue says she’s finally had enough of their “disgusting” behavior, cut them both off, and evicted both her children from her homes.
