{% raw %}Akin to DNA-based gene therapies, RNA-based therapies are the newest innovation in labs nationwide. Using the central intermediary ribonucleic acid (RNA), RNA-based therapies interfere with oneâ€™s genetic data at the level between DNA and proteins to intercept abnormalities. Today, the most popular and successful mechanisms of RNA therapy include antisense nucleotides and RNA interference. These new therapies are being explored in a variety of rare genetic diseases, with the hope of treatment by way of alternate genetic data.{% endraw %}
