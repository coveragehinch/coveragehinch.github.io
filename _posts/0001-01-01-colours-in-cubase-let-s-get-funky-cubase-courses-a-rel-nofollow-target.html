Follow along step by step and make a track yourself. You'll learn everything from music theory, to song structure, to sound design, to mixing and mastering and so much more, and more importantly - how to implement these skills into your own productions. Doing it yourself really is the best and most effective way to learn music production!<br /><br />With BTP, you not only learn Cubase - you learn music production at the same time!!<br /><br />Who are we? <br />Born To Produce was founded by professional music producers Jay Hales &amp; Jon Merritt with the aim of providing super usable and informative tutorial videos, that they never had access to when they were climbing the music production ropes. The entire aim is to boil complex topics down into easy to understand and easy to repeat, bite-size steps, so that everyone who wants to can discover the utter pleasure of music production. They have been teaching music production via their 'make a song from start to finish' style for 8 years now and consistently get fantastic feedback from students.<br /><br />Check out our feedback here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.borntoproduce.com/pages/what-youve-been-saying">https://www.borntoproduce.com/pages/what-youve-been-saying</a><br /><br /><br />If you are a beginner, you may want to take any of the below courses which are DAW specific before taking this EDM tutorial.<br /><br />Cubase <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.borntoproduce.com/products/cubase-tutorial-for-beginners">https://www.borntoproduce.com/products/cubase-tutorial-for-beginners</a><br /><br />FL Studio <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.borntoproduce.com/products/fl-studio-tutorial-for-beginners">https://www.borntoproduce.com/products/fl-studio-tutorial-for-beginners</a><br /><br />Logic Pro - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.borntoproduce.com/products/logic-pro-x-tutorial-for-beginners">https://www.borntoproduce.com/products/logic-pro-x-tutorial-for-beginners</a><br /><br />Ableton - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.borntoproduce.com/products/ableton-tutorial-for-beginners">https://www.borntoproduce.com/products/ableton-tutorial-for-beginners</a><br /><br />All Cubase Music Production Tutorials <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.borntoproduce.com/collections/cubase-tutorials">https://www.borntoproduce.com/collections/cubase-tutorials</a><br /><br />Advanced music production training for any DAW <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.borntoproduce.com/collections/producer-masterclass">https://www.borntoproduce.com/collections/producer-masterclass</a><br /><br />cubase tutorial<br />colours in cubase<br />colors cubase{% endraw %}
