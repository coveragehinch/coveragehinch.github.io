{% raw %}On the 31st of August, 1994, police were called to a quiet suburb outside of Detroit, where a 17-year-old boy was suspected of stealing tyres. When they challenged the boy in question, though, police were stunned to find that he hadn’t been stealing tyres at all, but instead had been loading what looked like components for a homemade atomic bomb into his car. The boy was David Hahn – a troubled but brilliant individual who later became known as “the Nuclear Boy Scout”.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:43 - Background<br />04:37 - The &quot;Reactor&quot;<br />09:07 - Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery.
