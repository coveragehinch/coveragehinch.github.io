{% raw %}Hi friends. In this video I will take you in my trip in search of ancient prehistoric cave paintings in Alwar. These paintings are of Palaeolithic era. The journey was full of adventure and thrill. The place is located near Dhadhikar fort in Alwar district in Rajasthan. It is at a distance of around 135-140 km from Delhi. We drove to the place by road in our car. One can do this in a day trip. So enjoy the trip. <br />These hidden cave paintings are least known. <br />The place is in complete wilderness so it is advisable to return before sun set. It is located nearby Sariska tiger reserve in Rajasthan and we get to know that often Leopards are sighted in this area. <br /><br />Read my blog of the journey <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abhitraveldiary.com/2018/12/prehistoric-cave-paintings-dhadhikar-alwar-rajasthan.html">https://www.abhitraveldiary.com/2018/12/prehistoric-cave-paintings-dhadhikar-alwar-rajasthan.html</a><br /><br /><br />Do like the video and share with your friends.
