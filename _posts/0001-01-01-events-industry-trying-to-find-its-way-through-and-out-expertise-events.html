{% raw %}Expertise Events Managing Director Gary Fitz-Roy says the events industry is trying to &quot;find its way through and out&quot; amid restrictions easing.<br /><br />&quot;The reality is that a lot of the borders opening in the states like New South Wales and Victoria - it's all come a little bit too late, so a lot of it has moved to the new year,&quot; he told Sky News Australia.<br /><br />He said Oz Comic Con is set to be &quot;a little bit different&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;We've called it Oz Comic Con Homegrown because of the borders - unfortunately with restrictions still out of Queensland and WA and some of the other states still affected.<br /><br />&quot;So Homegrown means it is very much a localised event.&quot;<br /><br />He said despite this, organisers are &quot;throwing everything at it&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;We're in the middle of contracting talent, so you'll see film and TV talent at the event this year - we haven't seen that for two years or plus so the reality is that's a really good move.&quot;{% endraw %}
