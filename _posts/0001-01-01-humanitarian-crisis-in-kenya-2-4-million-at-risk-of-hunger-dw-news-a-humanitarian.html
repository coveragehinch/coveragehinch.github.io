{% raw %}A humanitarian disaster is unfolding in Kenya where more than 20 counties are affected by a drought. One of the worst hit counties is Marsabit in Northern Kenya where it hasn’t rained for a full year now. Millions of livestock died, wells dried up, people’s livelihoods vanish in front of their eyes.
