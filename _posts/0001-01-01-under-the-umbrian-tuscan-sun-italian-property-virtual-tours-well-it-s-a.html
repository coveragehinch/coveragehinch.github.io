Between the main living room and the 2 bedroom outbuilding is a covered dining area with cooking equipment, wet bar and a barbecue. Above the complex is the large heated pool, with an expanse of stone paved solarium area and a motorised metal cover. There is also an external shower at the pool with hot water and a bathroom servicing the pool area.<br /> <br />The property is complete with some 26 hectares of land, including 200 olive trees, lots of woodland and a 5 year old Syrah grape vineyard currently producing about 80 bottles per year.<br /><br />Go to our YouTube channel and see our latest amazing one take Italian Property Virtual Tours.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/italianproperty">https://www.youtube.com/italianproperty</a><br /><br />To see our website with hundreds of amazing Italian properties please go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abodeitaly.com">https://www.abodeitaly.com</a><br /><br />Need to reach out?<br /><br />Email us info@abodeitaly.com.
