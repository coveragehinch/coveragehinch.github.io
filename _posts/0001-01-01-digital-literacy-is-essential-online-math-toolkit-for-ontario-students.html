Today’s students use tools such as cell phones and tablets to do much more than play games and socialize. Becoming digitally literate means learning essential life skills. <br /><br />This is no different when it comes to the way kids learn their math skills. The way of teaching math is evolving and kids are building their skills in a more digital age!  <br /><br />Evan Clementino – Student, Grade 10<br />Math is definitely one of those classes where the computers, and the smart boards, they come in really, really handy. Our teacher can just pull up the marker and just scribble on that white board<br /><br />Michelle Schira Hagerman – Assistant Professor of Educational Technology, Ottawa U<br />Computational thinking, coding; these are mathematical skills. And the ability of a child to learn how digital tools work, how they’re designed, requires mathematical, computational thinking skills. <br /><br />Sunil Singh – Math Teacher (NetMath)<br />It’s the way that kids are learning. These days, kids are social learners, experiential learners, visual learners, auditory learners, verbal learners, logical learners… and they’re merging it with being basically being social media, digital teens. And so they’re learning differently. <br /><br />Visit MathPathOntario.com for more information!{% endraw %}
