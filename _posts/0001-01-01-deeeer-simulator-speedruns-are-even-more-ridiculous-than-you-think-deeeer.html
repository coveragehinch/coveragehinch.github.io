{% raw %}DEEEER Simulator is probably one of the most ridiculous games that you will ever see, and speedrunning makes it even better<br /><br />Watch live at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy">http://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy</a><br /><br />▶ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy">https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy</a><br />▶ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/">https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/</a><br />▶ Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eazyspeezy.com">https://eazyspeezy.com</a><br /><br />Edited by: @The Suited Bird <br />Watch the world record run here: <br /><br />My channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!<br /><br />DEEEER Simulator: Your Average Everyday Deer Game description (from Steam):<br /><br />DEEEER Simulator: Your Average Everyday Deer Game is a game planned to be made available on Steam in which you take the role of the main character: a deer. Run around town freely taking advantage of the main character's deer-specific attribute, such as your stretchy neck and your stabby antlers!<br /><br />Put simply, DEEEER Simulator is a &quot;Slow-Life Town Destruction Game&quot;. You can spend your days enjoying a nice, relaxed frolic  here and there together with the other animals around town, or you can choose to relieve some stress and absolutely destroy the town and everything in it. Of course, if you choose the destructive route, you may end up being chased down by police and meeting a tragic end!<br /><br />Smash through everyday life in an unassuming town to unleash the true power of the deer!<br /><br />#EazySpeezy #DEEEERSimulator #Speedrun{% endraw %}
