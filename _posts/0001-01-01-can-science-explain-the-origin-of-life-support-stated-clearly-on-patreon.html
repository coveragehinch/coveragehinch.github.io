The origin of life needs its own explanation.<br /><br />Scientists don't currently have a complete explanation for life's origins, but different labs around the globe are looking into the idea that life may have emerged from chemistry. In this animation you will learn why they are studying this idea, and you'll get to see a few of the fascinating things they have discovered.<br /><br />Here are some links for further learning (organized by topic):<br /><br />OVERVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCH<br /><br />Here David Deamer gives a wonderful overview of our current understanding of the origin of life.
