Great for toddlers, preschool and kindergarten children as well as the ESL and EFL classroom. <br /><br />All of our songs, games and activities are developed and tested in-house by experienced teachers at our well-established language school in Japan. Kids learn best when they don’t realize that they’re learning. Our materials are often inspired by natural play and interaction in the classroom.<br /><br />Our unique style of blending physical elements (realia) into songs will get even the most shy, unwilling children hooked, participating and singing along. With a big scoop of fun and a sprinkle of silly, we make learning incredibly fun. So, you’re sure to have instant hits that children will ask for again and again.{% endraw %}
