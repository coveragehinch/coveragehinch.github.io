{% raw %}Sofi Stock led by CEO Anthony Noto has been dipping which has caused some investors to panic. But NOT Sofi's insiders specifically Sofi's Chairman of the Board Tom Hutton George aka Tom Hutton or as they know him on the streets T-Hutt! He instead went against the grain and exercised some options to instead add to his Sofi position. For those of you who donâ€™t know what stock options are basically, you get the right to either buy or sell securities at a stated price within a specific amount of time and it all depends on what type of options contract youâ€™ve chosen. In this case, the Chairman of SoFiâ€™s Board, Hutton George, has exercised his stock options to buy more common stocks of SoFi. Each option exercised costs about 0.02 cents. Those options have been converted into common stocks amounting to 348,560 shares. All in all, Hutton now has 829,520 SoFi shares. Tom Hutton exercised these options all while some big names in the industry have been selling out such as SoftBank Group Corp., Qatar Investment Authority, Wilkes Thomas Clayton, &amp; Slta Lvgp L.L.C. If that's not buying the dip then I don't know what is! Tom Hutton is holding the line, and we hear at Wealth Gambit will be following in his footsteps &amp; adding to our position every chance we get.
