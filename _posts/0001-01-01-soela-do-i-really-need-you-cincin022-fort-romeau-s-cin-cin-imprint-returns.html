{% raw %}Fort Romeau’s Cin Cin imprint returns with an emotive house cut from Soela. <br /><br />Two new tracks “Berlin” and “Do I Really Need You” see her develop on the deep, modern and melodic style of house music she crafted on her excellent debut LP “Genuine Silk” (Dial Records) and across previous EPs on Cologne powerhouse Kompakt. <br /><br />The full EP 'Berlin / Do I Really Need You' is out the 17th September. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/CINCIN022">http://smarturl.it/CINCIN022</a>{% endraw %}
