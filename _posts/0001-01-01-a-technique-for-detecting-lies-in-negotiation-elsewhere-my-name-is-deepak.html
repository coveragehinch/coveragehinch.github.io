{% raw %}My name is Deepak Malhotra and I'm a professor at Harvard Business School.  I have been on the faculty of Harvard for 18 years, and my area of work (research, teaching, consulting/advising) is negotiation. This clip is part of a series of videos I will be posting on the topic of negotiation.  Each video will be about 3-5 minutes long, and cover one insight, principle or tactic that will hopefully help you negotiate more effectively at work and in life.  Please feel free to share this video/series with your various networks.  Hopefully, we can create a lot of value together.  <br />If you want to learn more on the topic of negotiation, feel free to check out either of my two best-selling books on the topic:<br />- Negotiation Genius (with Max Bazerman)<br />- Negotiating the Impossible{% endraw %}
