{% raw %}This is the second video about the stunning beauty of Calgary Alberta. The natural beauty of Canadian cities and towns have healing effect. I have provided information about different cities near Calgary and also have given visual content in the form of images and footages. This is the area where a lot of Bollywood and Hollywood stars come for shooting. If you go for morning walk, you will frequently come across deer and other animals in this area. Louise Lake and Banff Lake are among the many that are joy for eyes in Alberta. So enjoy this video and give your feedback.<br />Photo Credit to my dear friend Ayesha Imran{% endraw %}
