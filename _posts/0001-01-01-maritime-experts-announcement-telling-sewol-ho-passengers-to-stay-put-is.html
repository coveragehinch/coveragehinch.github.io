{% raw %}When the Sewol-ho ferry first ran into trouble, most of its passengers followed the instructions given to them by the ship's crew and stayed put inside the ship.<br />This piece of information has confounded foreign maritime experts,... who say... that decision... and the indecisiveness on the part of the captain and crew, likely doomed hundreds on board.<br />Our Yoo Li-an has the details. <br />Maritime experts describe the announcements on the Sewol-ho ferry,... instructing people to stay in their rooms at the time of the accident as totally incomprehensible. <br /><br />&quot;In 99.9% of cases the crew is on top of it. They are well-trained and they are able to evacuate the ship in plenty of time.&quot;<br /><br />The retired commodore says it is unacceptable that the captain completely failed in his duties to take control,... during the crucial moments after the accident.<br /><br />&quot;Key decisions should be made within the captains' minds within 5 to 10 minutes as soon as he gets a report from all the departments of the ship and assesses how much damage is done to the vessel itself.&quot;<br /><br />Logs show that the captain of the Sewol-ho ferry, Lee Joon-seok,... delayed evacuation for at least 30 minutes after the ship began to capsize. <br />Others say the announcement telling people to stay where they were... actually made the situation worse.<br />Mario Vittone, a former U.S. Coast Guard maritime accident investigator and inspector says if those announcements were NOT made,.. the passengers would have gone to the deck to see what was going on.<br />Thad Allen, the former head of the U.S. Coast Guard, said common sense dictates that when a situation is deteriorating,... the crew needs to give up on trying to save the ship and pour efforts in to saving the passengers.<br />Yoo Li-an, Arirang News.{% endraw %}
