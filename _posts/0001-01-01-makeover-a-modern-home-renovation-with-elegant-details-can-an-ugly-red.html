{% raw %}Can an ugly red brick building of rental units become a dazzling home filled with light? Yes it can! Designer Tara Finlay of Ancerl Studio used classic, high-end finishes and detailing to create a Parisian-inspired house in Toronto. You'll love the gourmet kitchen built around a Lacanche range, folding glass doors and classic Carrara marble. No detail was overlooked to totally transform the old, worn structure into this dreamy space!<br /><br />Design, Tara Finlay, Ancerl Studio, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ancerlstudio.com/">https://www.ancerlstudio.com/</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />MORE DESIGN INSPIRATION<br />• Subscribe to H&amp;H's YouTube Channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/IZae51">https://goo.gl/IZae51</a><br />• Beautiful photo galleries <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://houseandhome.com/galleries/">https://houseandhome.com/galleries/</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />CONNECT WITH HOUSE &amp; HOME!<br />• Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/houseandhomemagazine/">https://facebook.com/houseandhomemagazine/</a><br />• Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/houseandhomemag/">https://instagram.com/houseandhomemag/</a><br />• Pinterest <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinterest.com/houseandhome/">https://pinterest.com/houseandhome/</a><br />• Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HouseandHome">https://twitter.com/HouseandHome</a>{% endraw %}
