Probably 98% of vitamins sold are synthetic. Some people will say there is no difference between synthetic vitamins and natural vitamins, but there is a big difference. <br /><br />In nature, vitamins always come in a complex of cofactors and coenzymes, which are like helpers. They don’t come as an individual fractionated part of a vitamin.<br /><br />Synthetic vitamins are the dl forms, and the natural vitamins are the d forms. I recommend getting food-based vitamins over synthetic vitamins and natural vitamins. <br /><br />Synthetic B vitamins are made from coal tar. Synthetic vitamin C is made from sulfuric acid and corn, which is GMO. Synthetic vitamin K2 has a synthetic version called MK-4.<br /><br />In nature, vitamin C comes with different parts, including ascorbic acid, P factor, J factor, copper, and vitamin K. Vitamin C is much more than ascorbic acid. <br /><br />The only time you may want to take synthetic vitamins is during a cleanse, but only short term. <br /><br />Some studies show that synthetic vitamins, especially fat-soluble synthetic vitamins, could potentially cause health issues, including cancer. <br /><br />People sell synthetic vitamins because there’s a lot of profit in it. Be sure to look on the label of the vitamin supplements you buy to make sure the dosages are not all the same because, in nature, they wouldn’t be the same. Look at the ingredients to see if it says “from wheatgrass” or from a certain vegetable. <br /><br />Get your vitamins from food, concentrated food, and food-based complexes. <br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: <br />Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
