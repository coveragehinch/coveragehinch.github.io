{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://teachmegrappling.com">http://teachmegrappling.com</a>  This video demonstrates how to use the whizzer to throw your opponent down when he attempts to take you down with an underhook across your waist. Sometimes your opponent comes up in the &quot;dog fight&quot; position from a half guard, now you can knock him back down. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please comment below. More videos to come!{% endraw %}
