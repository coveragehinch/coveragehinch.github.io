What Hip Hop artist say, wear, drive, drink and eat influences the purchases of millions of people around the world. As more and more influential Hip Hop artists adopt a food conscious lifestyle, it has the potential to radically shift the world they speak to. Their global influence has a real possibility of combatting chronic disease, minimizing climate change, reducing healthcare costs, ending starvation and promoting compassion.<br /><br />The aim of the film is to encourage critical thought about justice by highlighting Hip Hop artists and activist who speak about injustice in all its forms. The film addresses food access and food deserts, nutritional and environmental racism, diet related diseases, racial disparities of disease, government corruption, animal cruelty, climate change and ultimately how the influence of Hip Hop will save the world.&quot;<br /><br />Subscribe to The Exam Room Podcast<br />Apple: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2JXBkpy​​">https://apple.co/2JXBkpy​​</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/2pMLoY3">https://spoti.fi/2pMLoY3</a><br /><br />Physicians Committee<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/physicianscommittee">https://www.instagram.com/physicianscommittee</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PCRM.org">https://www.facebook.com/PCRM.org</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/pcrm">https://www.twitter.com/pcrm</a><br /><br />John Lewis<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/badassvegan">https://www.instagram.com/badassvegan</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/badassvegan">https://www.facebook.com/badassvegan</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://badassvegan.com">https://badassvegan.com</a><br /><br />Keegan Kuhn<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/firstsparkmedia">https://www.instagram.com/firstsparkmedia</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/keeganlkuhn">https://www.facebook.com/keeganlkuhn</a><br /><br />Chuck Carroll<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc">https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">https://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/weightlosschampion">https://www.facebook.com/weightlosschampion</a><br /><br />--<br />About Us<br />The Physicians Committee is dedicated to saving lives through plant-based diets and ethical and effective scientific research.
