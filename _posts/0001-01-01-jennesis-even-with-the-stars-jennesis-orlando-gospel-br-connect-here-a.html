In the story - Jesus, being weak from fasting for 40 days is tempted by Satan. Often illustrated as a red being with horns and a pitch fork, Jenesis brings a realistic portrayal of the adversary who oftentimes comes to us in a way we would least expect, even masquerading as an “angel of light”.{% endraw %}
