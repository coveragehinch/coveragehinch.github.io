{% raw %}Unless you know what you're doing, don't.<br />I have found a paper on 'safety holes'... very interesting.<br /><br />One could argue that chicks that are not strong enough to get out of the egg by themselves should not survive. I have a different opinion.<br />To me all life is precious. So if I can save a chick by helping it, I will.<br /><br />The 'safety holes' are used when incubating rear and endangered bird species. It increases the chances of survival in the fiercely process of hatching.<br />Yet one has to be extremely careful. It happens easily that a chick get's injured.<br />This video is about the hatching of my emu eggs, the second largest eggs in the world. (and the most beautiful ones :)<br />The first Emu chick got out all by himself. The second one needed a little help.<br /><br />*** Care to join our kind community of animal loving sponsors?

First crack<br />I was very exited <br />Yet it took another day before it went further<br />Two days after the first crack, I thought now we were almost there<br />But it still went slow<br />And the other egg (nr 6) started to worry me<br />It was still reacting to me, yet lesser and weaker<br />The chick seemed to be too weak to crack the shell<br />Weaker chicks might die at this point<br />There isn’t much you can do<br />But I study eggs :)<br />And I had found a most interesting paper<br />A study on ‘safety holes’<br />The idea is simple: by very carefully making a little hole…<br />Inside the ‘air chamber’, the chick can breathe oxygen and gain strength <br />First I had to be sure on which side to drill, so I listened<br />Now I needed to work very carefully<br />I started at a natural spot<br />“Yes, yes, I know…”<br />The shell was a lot harder than I had thought it would be<br />It took surprisingly much effort<br />There is still a whole net of tiny blood vessels surrounding the chick<br />Loosing a drop of blood from one of them is not a problem<br />As long as I don’t shoot-out<br />Good… Now it can breathe<br />Almost immediately it sounded better, stronger<br />I used my phone to record its sound<br />When I returned at the incubator, the first chick was already out of its egg<br />So I put it in an old incubator to dry<br />The ‘safety hole’ proved to be very effective<br />So a short while later…<br />This one went a bot quicker now, but it still took some hours<br />Here are the highlights<br />In nature it would be under a giant bird right now <br />Over here it needs a little help to get rid of the last parts<br />So now I have two baby emus at home<br />Might need to look for a bigger house soon<br /><br />More stories soon     cool if you subscribe<br /><br />The incubator I used is a MS incubator<br />MS incubators (made in Holland)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.broedmachine.nl/">https://www.broedmachine.nl/</a><br />And in English <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.broedmachine.nl/?___store=english&amp;___from_store=dutch">https://www.broedmachine.nl/?___store=english&amp;___from_store=dutch</a><br /><br />For filming I used a canon EOSD7 and an I-phone 5s<br /><br />All our music comes from audionetwork.com<br />Music in this video:<br />'Hurricane' by Keith Beauvais (PRS)<br />'Clues Clues Clues' by Luke Richards (PRS)<br />Postcard From Hell by Lincoln Grounds(PRS)/Michael Pearse (PRS)<br />Conversations With Angels by Luke Richards (PRS)<br />Le Serpent by Cyril Giroux (SACEM) / David Bossan (SACEM) / Campbell E Browning (PRS) / Pablo Love (PRS){% endraw %}
