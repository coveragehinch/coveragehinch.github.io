{% raw %}FISHPOND CONSTRUCTION. This is as documentary as I've been before, looking at how fishponds are made. The three guys from Hinatuan are doing some fantastic work and I want to showcase it here. <br /><br />Working with bamboo, wood, sacks and the mud found in the pond, we are strengthening my fishpond home in Davao to protect it from the forces of nature. This is the first part of actual construction! <br /><br />Are these the Strongest Men In Mindanao?<br /><br />I am looking forward to the final result! <br /><br />================<br />BRAND NEW MERCHANDISE!
