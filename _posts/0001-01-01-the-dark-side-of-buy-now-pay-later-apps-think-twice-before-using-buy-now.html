Find out how expensive it is to offer (for a merchant), how that can increase prices, and how using other methods to pay might be better for you (and also for lower income households!)<br /><br />***Correction: As pointed out by the (great) blog &quot;Michael James on Money&quot;, I should have factored in that the BNPL company collects a riskless $25 payment upfront. So really, they lent out $69 over 6 weeks. That increases the effective APR on their loan from 55% to 76%.
