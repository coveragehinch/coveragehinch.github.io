{% raw %}An inspirational and profound speech on the nature of reality by Alan Watts. Original Audio sourced from: “Alan Watts - What Is Reality&quot;<br />Speaker: Alan Watts<br /><br />“Tomorrow and plans for tomorrow can have no significance at all unless you are in full contact with the reality of the present, since it is in the present and only in the present that you live. There is no other reality than present reality, so that, even if one were to live for endless ages, to live for the future would be to miss the point everlastingly.”<br />– Alan Watts. (1915 – 1973)<br /><br />►Follow the Alan Watts Organization:<br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/alanwattsproject">https://www.youtube.com/c/alanwattsproject</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/alanwattsofficial">https://www.facebook.com/alanwattsofficial</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/alanwattsorg/">https://www.instagram.com/alanwattsorg/</a><br /><br />Speech courtesy of alanwatts.org<br /><br />Licensed from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mindsetdrm.com">https://mindsetdrm.com</a><br /><br />►Follow T&amp;H:<br />Mindset App: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.mindsetapp.com/THMotivation">https://link.mindsetapp.com/THMotivation</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/THinspirationMotivation/">https://www.facebook.com/THinspirationMotivation/</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tradgedyandhope">https://www.youtube.com/user/tradgedyandhope</a>{% endraw %}
