Why are things colored the way they are ‚Äî and how many ways can you answer that question before this light changes? <br /><br />Did you know, for example, that before 1905, taxis were red and green?

Yeah, brown as in, the same color as the wooden court! In the 1950s, they switched to orange because it was easier to see. <br />- Mainstream manufacturers bleach their toilet paper to make it sparkly white because white is associated with cleanliness.<br />- Believe it or not, white dresses were for mourning until Queen Victoria‚Äîone of history‚Äôs first style influencers‚Äî wore a white dress at her wedding and changed tradition forever!<br />- The Blue Riband was a pennant awarded to the fastest passenger ship crossing the Atlantic. Over the years, Riband got changed to Ribbon, but the blue part stuck. <br />- Red means emergency, so it‚Äôs a natural choice for fire engines. But today, more and more fire trucks are being painted ‚Ä¶ lime green and yellow!<br />- When Walter Diemer created his best bubble gum recipe‚Äîless sticky, more bubbles!‚Äîhe made it pink because, well, that was the color he had!<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
