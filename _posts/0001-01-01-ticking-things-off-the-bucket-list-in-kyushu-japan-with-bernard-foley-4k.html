{% raw %}Despite being terrible at all sports, I somehow managed to get to hang out with Bernard Foley in Kyushu for 3 days and we had a blast! Kyushu Tourism took us through Fukuoka, Oita and Kumamoto prefectures and covered everything from soy sauce factories to Rugby World Cup to biking through Mt Aso. I hope you enjoy it!<br /><br />•<br /><br />Support me on Patreon for extra content and early access: <br />www.patreon.com/currentlyhannah <br /><br />Instagram:<br />Normal stuff: @currently.hannah<br />Performing stuff: @hannahpriceperformer<br /><br />•<br /><br />Music in this video is from these two sites: <br />Artlist:<br />(Sign up with this link for 2 extra months free)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artlist.io/artlist-70446/?artlist_aid=CurrentlyHannah_176&amp;utm_source=affiliate_p&amp;utm_medium=CurrentlyHannah_176&amp;utm_campaign=CurrentlyHannah_176">https://artlist.io/artlist-70446/?artlist_aid=CurrentlyHannah_176&amp;utm_source=affiliate_p&amp;utm_medium=CurrentlyHannah_176&amp;utm_campaign=CurrentlyHannah_176</a><br /><br />Musicbed:<br />(Get a free trial with this link)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/musicbedref">https://geni.us/musicbedref</a><br /><br />•<br /><br />My preferred form of accomodation: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/hanairbnb">https://geni.us/hanairbnb</a><br /><br />•<br /><br />All filming and editing gear - past and present is listed in my kit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/currentlyhannah">https://kit.co/currentlyhannah</a><br /><br />#CurrentlyHannah #BernardFoley #Kyushu{% endraw %}
