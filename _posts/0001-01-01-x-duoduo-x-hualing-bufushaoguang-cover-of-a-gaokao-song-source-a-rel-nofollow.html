This song, in particular, is so amazing - even better than the original, which was half-sung by Hanser so that's saying quite a lot - that I just *had* to reupload it. Enjoy. This song was made for takers of this year's annual gaokao exam. May they do their best this year and all years thereafter.{% endraw %}
