{% raw %}No farmer wants to lose precious nutrients in the cool season, but this is exactly what happens when a field is left fallow. We visited with Penn State's Dr. Sjoerd Duiker to talk about how they use cover crops to ensure that those nutrients stay where they belong.<br /><br />Dr. Sjoerd Duiker is an Associate Professor of Soil Management and Applied Soil Physics at Penn State University. After studying Tropical Crop Science for his Master's degree at Wageningen Agricultural University in the Netherlands, Dr. Duiker earned his Ph.D. in soil sciences from Ohio State University in 2000. As an agronomist, Dr. Duiker works closely with local farmers to improve the sustainability and yields of their farms through better management practices. One of Dr. Duiker's main research interests is on how the use of no-till agriculture and cover crops improves soil quality on farms.{% endraw %}
