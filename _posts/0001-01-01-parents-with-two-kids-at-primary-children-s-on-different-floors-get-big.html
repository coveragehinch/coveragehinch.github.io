Secret Santa is a real person who wants to remain anonymous and hopes to bless as many individuals in our community as he can.<br /><br />Sereneti and Andy Migel have five adorable children. They are wonderful, hard-working, kind people. Serenti is always helping her friends and neighbors — taking meals, dropping off flowers or babysitting for families in need.<br /><br />Their youngest daughter, Merry Hope, is 2 years old and was born with congenital cervical kyphosis, a birth defect where her neck curves the wrong direction. Merry also has extensive tumors on her spine.<br /><br />The Migels took Merry to Primary Children’s Hospital in July where she stayed for one month. She had two surgeries to straighten her neck and remove the tumors.<br /><br />A few weeks after being admitted, the Migel’s 11-year-old son, Spencer, was taken to the emergency room. He had been having severe pain in his lower abdomen and was vomiting a lot. The doctor discovered a large mass and he was also admitted to Primary Children’s Hospital where he spent five days, overlapping Merry’s stay.<br /><br />The biopsy showed the growth was ganglioneuroblastoma intermixed variant, a type of cancer. Spencer had surgery last month at Primary Children’s to remove the tumor.<br /><br />Merry is now home but still has a tracheotomy and a large spine and shoulder collar to stabilize her<br />neck. She will have more procedures next year.<br /><br />The Migels have remained positive and optimistic through all of their challenges. Secret Santa asked the East Idaho News team to pay them a visit with some early Christmas gifts. Watch the video above to see Sereneti’s response!{% endraw %}
