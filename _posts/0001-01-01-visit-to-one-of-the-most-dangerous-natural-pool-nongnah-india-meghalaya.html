{% raw %}Since we have family gathering at Mawten (Father-in-laws place) We went home and we took the opportunity to visit Nongnah. The place is far and beautiful, and we would also  like to request all our friends, family and visitors  to keep the place clean when you visit 🙏🏻.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Music: Artlist{% endraw %}
