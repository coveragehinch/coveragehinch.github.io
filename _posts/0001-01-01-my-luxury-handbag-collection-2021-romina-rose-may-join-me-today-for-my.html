Do you love luxury shopping vlogs as much as I do? I really missed Harrods and I can't believe how many beautiful designer handbags I spotted!! The new Chanel Fall Winter 2021 Collection is finally out - otherwise known as the Chanel 21K Collection - and I've fallen in love with the red velvet Chanel Mini Rectangular, the pink Chanel Coco Handle, the rainbow Chanel Mini Reissue and the black Chanel CC Tote which is a vintage Chanel bag that has been reissued for this year's Chanel 21K Collection!! However, the pink Chanel Diana Bag and the Chanel Classic Flap Bag in the Jumbo size are still next on my handbag wishlist!! I can't wait to show you more of Chanel Cruise 2022 - or Chanel 22C - which is going to hit the boutiques this month!!<br /><br />Luxury shopping in London is great, especially shopping at Dior, Chanel &amp; Louis Vuitton!! You never know what you'll find on a luxury shopping spree!! I love the Bottega Veneta Chain Pouch in black and my dream Fendi Peekaboo Mini with the embroidered flowers!! Another highlight was the Louis Vuitton Papillon Trunk Bag - they still don't have any Louis Vuitton Nano Speedy models in stock. Stay tuned for my luxury shopping haul next week - can you guess what items I bought? Maybe something from Dior - a Dior Saddle Bag, a Dior Book Tote or another Lady Dior - what do we think about Dior's new micro bags by the way? I'm in love with the micro Lady Dior!! Or maybe some Dior jewellery? I've been collecting many Dior jewelry pieces for some time now, especially Dior earrings!! I'm also a sucker for Chanel earrings and Chanel jewellery in general!! Did you spot anything in the Chanel Sale - maybe some Chanel shoes?<br /><br />Next week, we are going to visit Designer Exchange London in Knightsbridge - a reseller of vintage and pre-loved designer handbags. They have so many beautiful Hermes Birkin 30 models in stock - what Hermès Birkin or Kelly do you dream of adding to your handbag collection? Also, which luxury handbags do you want to buy next?
