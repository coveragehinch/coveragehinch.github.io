{% raw %}Here you are shown how to estimate a root of an equation by using interval bisection. We first find an interval that the root lies in by using the change in sign method and then once the interval is found we bisect it and again look for a change in sign to construct a new interval. This process continues until the required accuracy is found.<br /><br />YOUTUBE CHANNEL at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/ExamSolutions">https://www.youtube.com/ExamSolutions</a><br /><br />EXAMSOLUTIONS WEBSITE at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.examsolutions.net/">https://www.examsolutions.net/</a> where you will have access to all playlists covering pure maths, statistics and mechanics.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/examsolutions.net/">https://www.facebook.com/examsolutions.net/</a><br /><br />NEW INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/examsolutionsguy/">https://www.instagram.com/examsolutionsguy/</a><br /><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ExamSolutions">https://twitter.com/ExamSolutions</a><br /><br /><br />THE BEST THANK YOU: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.examsolutions.net/donation/">https://www.examsolutions.net/donation/</a><br />FOR MORE HELP PLEASE VISIT <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.airmathstuition.com">https://www.airmathstuition.com</a>{% endraw %}
