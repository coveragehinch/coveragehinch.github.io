What does CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER mean? CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER meaning - CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER definition - CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER explanation.<br /><br />Source: Wikipedia.org article, adapted under <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a> license.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to our Google Earth flights channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6UuCPh7GrXznZi0Hz2YQnQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6UuCPh7GrXznZi0Hz2YQnQ</a><br /><br />Concentrated solar power (also called concentrating solar power, concentrated solar thermal, and CSP) systems generate solar power by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight, or solar thermal energy, onto a small area. Electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine (usually a steam turbine) connected to an electrical power generator or powers a thermochemical reaction (experimental as of 2013). Heat storage in molten salts allows solar thermal plants to continue to generate after sunset and adds value to such systems when compared to photovoltaic panels.<br /><br />CSP is being commercialized and the CSP had a capacity of 4,815 MW in 2016 up from 354 MW in 2005. As of 2017, Spain had a total capacity of 2,300 MW making this country the world leader in CSP. United States follows with 1,740 MW. Interest is also notable in North Africa and the Middle East, as well as India and China. The global market has been dominated by parabolic-trough plants, which accounted for 90% of CSP plants at one point. The largest CSP projects in the world are Ivanpah Solar Power Facility (392 MW) in the United States (which uses solar power tower technology), Mojave Solar Project (354 MW) in the United States (which uses parabolic troughs) and Dhirubhai Ambani Solar Park (100 MW) in India (which uses Fresnel reflectors)<br /><br />In most cases, CSP technologies currently cannot compete on price with photovoltaics (solar panels), which have experienced huge growth in recent years due to falling prices and much smaller operating costs. CSP generally needs large amount of direct solar radiation, and its energy generation falls dramatically with cloud cover. This is in contrast with photovoltaics, which can produce energy also from diffuse radiation. For example, base load purpose CSP tariff in the extremely dry Atacama region of Chile reached below c5.0/kWh. In 2017, CSP represented less than 2% of worldwide installed capacity of solar electricity plants. In 2017, drastically falling prices of CSP plants are turning clean CSP cheaper compared to other base load power plants using gas/coal/nuclear fuel even in high moisture and dusty atmosphere at sea level.<br /><br />CSP is not to be confused with concentrator photovoltaics (CPV). In CPV, the concentrated sunlight is converted directly to electricity via the photovoltaic effect.{% endraw %}
