{% raw %}It is not clear whether the US government will offer Ghislaine Maxwell a deal, even if the disgraced socialite agrees to be a witness against other child sex traffickers, according to New York University’s Stephen Gillers.<br /><br />Ms Maxwell is now facing the prospect of years in prison, after being found guilty on five out of six charges against her.<br /><br />She was accused of recruiting and grooming four teenagers for Jeffrey Epstein to molest between 1994 and 2004 at his various properties.<br /><br />It is alleged multiple powerful people may have been implicated in the child sex trafficking ring run by Maxwell and Epstein.<br /><br />Professor Gillers said Ms Maxwell may offer to provide names of alleged perpetrators to authorities, however it is not clear if this would mitigate her sentence.<br /><br />“She did not offer to cooperate to identify others,” Professor Gillers told Sky News.<br /><br />“Now she might offer to be a witness against others in an effort to keep her sentence lower than it otherwise would be.<br /><br />“Whether the government is willing to accept that deal is another question.”{% endraw %}
