Once things get back to normal, we will make another video clearly stating the damage the pandemic did on the aviation industry. <br />Some very famous names will make the list of this Top 10 such as FlyBe, Norwegian Air Shuttle, and others so make sure to watch the video until the end to discover them all. Not only you will have a list of these airlines, but I will also give you a quick historical background to emphasize the other reasons that led to these companies' collapse. <br />I’m fully aware that behind these companies collapses there’re flight crew members, cabin crew members, airport staff, office members, mechanics, families, friends, and people’s lives being involved. That’s why we’re thinking about them all and we’re sharing our deepest support. <br />*<br />Check out some of our other videos: <br /><br />10 AIRLINE LOGOS WITH A HIDDEN MEANING! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/n7af-9yyDGY">https://youtu.be/n7af-9yyDGY</a> <br /><br />Top 10 AVIATION CALLSIGNS YOU NEED TO KNOW! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Sp7vhkUdQQc">https://youtu.be/Sp7vhkUdQQc</a><br /><br />Subscribe to my channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/31iIuys">https://bit.ly/31iIuys</a><br /> * <br />This presentation contains images that were used under a Creative Commons License.
