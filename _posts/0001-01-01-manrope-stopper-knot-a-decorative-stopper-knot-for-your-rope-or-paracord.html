{% raw %}How to Tie a Manrope Stopper Knot - a Decorative Stopper Knot for Your Rope or Paracord.<br /><br />Basically the knot is tied with a wall knot and then a crown knot and the lines are doubled to produce a decorative stopper knot. In this tutorial I have tied the Manrope Knot using 3 lengths of synthetic cord for demonstration purposes only. This knot can be tied with three or more cords in natural rope or paracord. Once complete the Manrope knot makes a large stopper knot or a rather fancy knot for the end of a lanyard.<br /><br />Although this tutorial shows the Manrope Knot being made with 3 strands, more strands can be used, using the same principle.<br /><br />Sometimes called the Tack Knot, or Double Wall and Crown. <br /><br />The Manrope Knot is often used at the end of ropes on either side of gangways on ships.These knots are also often seen on the end of patio rope railings or on stairs where a rope bannister has been used. In this case the Manrope knot is not only decorative but also prevents the rope from sliding out of the metal or wooden eye.<br /><br />#LetsGetKnotting<br /><br />üí• SUBSCRIBE to see more new Knotting Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxfS18VYnZgg2rrJgzuX98w?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxfS18VYnZgg2rrJgzuX98w?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />üòâ I want the Spyderco C06TIP Tusk Marlin Spike Folding Knife!
