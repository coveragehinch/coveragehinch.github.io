Their name comes from the fact that early hedge funds (and some current ones) tried to &quot;hedge&quot; their exposure to the market (so they could, in theory, do well in an &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; market as long as they were good at picking the good companies). Today, hedge funds represent a huge class investment funds. They are far less regulated than, say, mutual funds. In exchange for this, they aren't allowed to market or take investments from &quot;unsophisticated&quot; investors. Some use their flexibility to mitigate risk, other use it to amplify it.<br /><br />About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.
