We wish him the best at his new job and I know you guys do too, it's tough, but we thank you for understanding. <br /><br />I swear we're making bark almost every day in the life vlog, but you guys keep ordering it, so we'll keep making it! And Brian is proving to be a very fast learner, just like Cooper! From the bottom of our collective hearts we are sorry to anyone who places their first order and doesn't receive a pen and magnet 💔<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />👕Check out our Teespring merch!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/hercules-candys-store">https://teespring.com/stores/hercules-candys-store</a><br />---------------------------------------------------<br />💑 About Hercules Candy<br />Hercules Candy has been on Steve’s side of the family since 1910(ish). When he took over in the 70’s, he anticipated after 10 years of hard work, he could move the business out of the basement and into a real storefront. Unfortunately, it took until 2018 for that to happen, but hey at least it happened! Steve and Terry own the shop, Craig (the social media manager) is their son, Cara (wrapper and shipper extraordinaire who is poised to take over the shop one day) is their daughter and Leah (who doesn’t love being on camera and is very elusive) is their oldest daughter. Karen has been working for Hercules Candy since the twins (Craig and Cara) were about 6 months old and everybody else is a new recruit.
