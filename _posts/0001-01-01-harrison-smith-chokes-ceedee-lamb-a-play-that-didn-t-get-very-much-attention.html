{% raw %}A play that didn’t get very much attention in Sunday’s Vikings-Cowboys game is picking up steam as potentially having been very dirty.<br /><br />#CeeDeeLamb was tackled on the sideline by Vikings safety #HarrisonSmith after a catch, but it appeared to be more than a garden-variety hit. In a video originally distributed by the #Cowboys, Smith appears to choke Lamb, and then Lamb can be seen on the Dallas bench saying that Smith “choked the f— out of me”{% endraw %}
