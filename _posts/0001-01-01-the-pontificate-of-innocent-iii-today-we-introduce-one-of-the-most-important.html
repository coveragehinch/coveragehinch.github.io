{% raw %}Today we introduce one of the most important figures of all the Middle Ages, Pope Innocent III, born as Lothar of the Counts of Segni. Under his pontificate the Church of Rome reached the height of its power and influence in Europe, bending most of its Christian princes to its will.<br /><br />Given the caliber of the figure, the video can only be introductory, focusing on the external and external causes that led to the Papal State reaching an unprecedented level of power between the end of the XII and the beginning of the XIII century. In addition to international politics, we also focus on the structuration of Papal power in central Italy.<br /><br />In the video we also talk about the Fourth Crusade, the Albigensian Crusade, the Fourth Lateran Council, the relationship between Innocent III, Frederick II of Swabia, Otto of Brunswick and together with them the broader influences of the Roman Curia in European politics from England to Constantinople.<br /><br />In the background Picture, Innocent III portrayed in a fresco of the monastery of Saint Benedict of Subiaco, Central Italy.{% endraw %}
