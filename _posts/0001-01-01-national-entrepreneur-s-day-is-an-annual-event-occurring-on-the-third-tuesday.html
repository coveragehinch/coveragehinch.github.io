{% raw %}National Entrepreneur’s Day is an annual event occurring on the third Tuesday of November (November 16)  that honors people who have built an empire from absolutely nothing. Radical inventions by brilliant minds have shaped the way we live today, not to mention our future. <br /><br />The word entrepreneur comes from the French word entreprendre, meaning “undertake.” It first appeared in the French dictionary “Dictionnaire Universel de Commerce,” produced by Jacques des Bruslons and published in 1723. <br /><br />#Entrepreneur’sDay #November #OnThisDay{% endraw %}
