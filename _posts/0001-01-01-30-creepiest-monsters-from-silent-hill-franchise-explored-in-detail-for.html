{% raw %}For decades, the survival horror genre has been a mainstay in the video game business. “Resident Evil” and “Dead Space” are two franchises that have chilled gamers to the bone and caused them plenty of restless nights. “Silent Hill”, however, is the one series that stands out as the most disturbing and gruesome of them all. “Silent Hill” contains some of the most terrifying animals you'll ever encounter. They're literally beings out of your nightmares come true, which fits in nicely with how much of the game's storyline is based on guilt and fury, regardless of the title. All of the creatures and bosses in that universe have a deeper meaning, and some of them are even gods. It's why the series is so well-made, and why many of the characters are so well-known even among those who haven't played the games.<br />The first game in this Konami series was released for the original PlayStation in 1999. It irrevocably altered the world of horror video games because the protagonist wasn't an excellent fighter, he was just a regular guy and each creature was more terrifying than usual. Even the bravest people would be terrified by some of the things you'd encounter. With that in mind, we've compiled a list of the thirty most horrifying Silent Hill monsters.<br />#SilentHill{% endraw %}
