{% raw %}The dawn ahead on the floor<br />The cracks so bare on the way<br />They like a flood spills away<br />Way as a world stains<br /><br />I like it would in the night<br />And traps the colors away<br />What is a breath behind your neck<br />We are the ones that stay<br /><br />And I'll be watching as you waste through the ground{% endraw %}
