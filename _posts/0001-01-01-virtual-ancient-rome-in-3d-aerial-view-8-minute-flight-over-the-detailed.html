{% raw %}Our goal is to create the most extensive, detailed and accurate virtual 3D reconstruction of Ancient Rome. In this video you can see the whole center of the Etrnal City from the air, as well as other significant areas, such ar Campus Martius, or Trastevere (Transtiberim). You can see the Forum, Colosseum, imperial Forums (Fori Imperiali), as well as famous baths, theaters, temples and palaces. This is the current progress of our project, and as you can see about 40% of all Rome, as it was in IV AD, is already done.<br />#ancient #Rome #3D<br /><br />Support us on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/historyin3d">https://www.patreon.com/historyin3d</a><br /><br />&quot;HISTORY IN 3D&quot; creative team:<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://relivehistoryin3d.com">https://relivehistoryin3d.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/romein3d">https://www.facebook.com/romein3d</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/historyin3d/">https://www.instagram.com/historyin3d/</a><br />VK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vk.com/relivehistoryin3d">https://vk.com/relivehistoryin3d</a><br /><br />Music in video:  &quot;Finding Myself&quot; by Michael Ramir C{% endraw %}
