Offers are only available for a limited time*<br />________________________________________________<br />00:00 Intro<br />01:10 Selling Items Online<br /><br />Platforms like ETSY are also great, especially if you're artsy, crafty or just good with your hands as people are making a lot of money from selling handmade goods.<br /><br />However, you don't have to sell physical items, they can be Digital as well. I'm talking about courses, templates, graphic designs and even NFTs. Now, if holding the product isn't your cup of tea, then maybe it's worth considering Amazon FBA. <br /><br />04:12 Becoming an Affiliate Marketer<br /><br />This can be done through writing blogs, social media &amp; posting reviews. On that note, you may have already seen this done on TikTok with those videos about Amazon products you NEED TO BUY. Just think, every time someone buys that product, they are getting a kickback and making sweet profit.<br /><br />6:20 Starting a YouTube Channel<br /><br />YouTubers generate money through something called called Adsense and what this basically means is in return for YouTube putting ads on your videos, you get a 55% slice of the revenue generated.<br /><br />Something to consider before you start YouTube is that not all channels are created equal. The amount of money you make depends on the type of content you create<br /><br />8:40 Creating Your Own Product Range<br /><br />This also has the added benefit of being extremely profitable, as you have full control over the price, materials used &amp; manufacturing process. This allows for healthy margins, which means ultimately more money ends up in your pocket!<br /><br />11:00 Investing in Real Estate <br /><br />The amazing thing about real estate is, you can multiply your money by leveraging a small amount of cash to take control of a cash flowing property. The most obvious way to do this is by putting in some tenants, so that they can be paying off your mortgage for you. The result of this is that you are able to use the rent to pay off the mortgage each month and also have a small about left over for yourself.<br /><br />13:08 Starting a Retail Store <br /><br />Before opening a store, there is a lot to consider. Such as location, niche, and if you have a hungry customer base. I like to call this the golden triangle, If one of or more of these things aren't correct, then you're headed for failure.<br /><br />15:28 Getting Brand Deals <br /><br />Theres been a huge shift recently in the advertising industry. in the past, the only way for advertisers to reach there intended market was to use traditional media like TV &amp; radio. But now, that's all changing and these big brands are now coming to individuals who have built a following online. <br /><br />18:03 Investing in Stocks &amp; Crypto <br /><br />Iâ€™m putting this as a bonus one as until you sell your stocks and crypto, you haven't actually realised your profts and therefore I don't think I can class this as a consistent income. Stocks &amp; Crypto have to be the easiest way to generate passive income, and it's definitely something you can get started on right away, with any amount of money.<br />________________________________________________<br />My Links:<br />âž¥ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/marktilbury">https://www.instagram.com/marktilbury</a><br />âž¥ Snapchat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.snapchat.com/add/marktilbury">https://www.snapchat.com/add/marktilbury</a><br />âž¥ My Second Channel:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.YouTube.com/c/marktilburyxtra">https://www.YouTube.com/c/marktilburyxtra</a><br />âž¥ My Podcast Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.YouTube.com/c/likefatherlikesonpodcast">https://www.YouTube.com/c/likefatherlikesonpodcast</a><br />âž¥ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/marktilbury">https://twitter.com/marktilbury</a><br />âž¥ Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/hXjW6pY">https://discord.gg/hXjW6pY</a><br />________________________________________________<br /><br />CONTACT:<br />For business inquires only, please use this email: mark@marktilbury.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Mark Tilbury will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
