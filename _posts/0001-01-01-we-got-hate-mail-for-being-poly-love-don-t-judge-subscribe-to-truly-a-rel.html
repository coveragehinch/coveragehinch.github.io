Maggie, 27, and Cody, 31, first met on Tinder in 2016 and got together almost immediately. Realising they were both interested in polyamory, they downloaded a dating app, hoping to find someone to have a fling with. Meanwhile, Janie, 26, had recently discovered she was bisexual and downloaded the same app in search of some fun. She soon matched with Cody and Maggie - and the rest is history. Though the throuple are happier than ever, they have faced some judgement for their relationship, including poison pen letters that featured screenshots of their social media accounts, accusing Janie of &quot;faking&quot; her sexuality, and saying that Cody &quot;lacked loyalty and commitment.&quot; Still, undeterred by the hate, Maggie, Janie and Cody continue to document their lives openly online, in the hope that they can dispel some common stereotypes about polyamory.<br /><br />Follow Jane, Maggie and Cody here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@3.mountains?">https://www.tiktok.com/@3.mountains?</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/3.mountains/">https://www.instagram.com/3.mountains/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCblGy7SIYEDhW4Rnfj3lQGw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCblGy7SIYEDhW4Rnfj3lQGw</a><br /><br />Videographer: Michael Catron<br />Producers: Erin Cardiff &amp; Yasmin Walker<br />Editor: Hailey Wang<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
