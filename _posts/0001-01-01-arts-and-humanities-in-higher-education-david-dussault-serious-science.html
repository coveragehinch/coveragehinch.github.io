{% raw %}David Dussault on human relationships, life experience and how to understand the influence that IT has on our everyday life.<br /><br />Read the full text on our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://serious-science.org/arts-and-humanities-in-higher-education-10582">http://serious-science.org/arts-and-humanities-in-higher-education-10582</a> <br /><br />'I think what the humanities does by reading things like Aristotle and Plato is it fills that experience gap. We’re not really talking about anything new here. Human relationships are complicated, yes, but as a society I don’t think we’ve invented anything new, humans are what humans are, and that’s that. But by reading I’m being exposed to the elements that the humanities embrace, whether it’s philosophy, whether it’s arts and culture, it all speaks to the products of human behavior. That helps our guys fill in that experience box, so when they go into the real world – huh, where did I see this before? Where was this talked about before? How can I interpret this situation? They have a sheet of music to work from.'<br /><br />David Dussault, PhD in Political Science, School of Advanced Studies, University of Tyumen<br /><br />Higher Education and Employability: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://serious-science.org/higher-education-and-employability-10560">http://serious-science.org/higher-education-and-employability-10560</a><br />Liberal Arts Education: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://serious-science.org/liberal-arts-education-10545">http://serious-science.org/liberal-arts-education-10545</a><br /><br />Be the first to find out about our new videos and articles.
