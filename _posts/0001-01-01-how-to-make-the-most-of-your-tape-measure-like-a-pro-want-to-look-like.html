{% raw %}Want to Look like a Pro? I show you how to make the most of your tape measure in this recent video.  There is more to a tape measure than meets the eye, and not all tape measures are created equal.  I share some insight on what I have learned over the years working in the trades with many different tape measures and maybe there is a tip or trick that you didn't know.  Watch til the end and you might end up being as surprised as my son was!<br /><br />I understand that most of you watching this have learned everything about a tape measure you need to know, but I don't necessarily make these videos for pros, rather the next generation.  If I can help someone make the most of their tape measure that is just learning the trades, and boost their learning curve compared to how I learned....trial and error... then that is why I take my time creating these videos.  <br /><br />So if you enjoyed this content, or know someone who could use a few insightful tips about their tape measure, please like and share this video.  The more it helps the better.<br /><br />Top Tool List Where you can find links to these tape measures too!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/TopToolList">http://bit.ly/TopToolList</a>{% endraw %}
