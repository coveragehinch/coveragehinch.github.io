Whether it be a mysterious ghostly image, or a snapshot of something truly bizarre, historical photographs provide a window into a world that is long past and allow us to experience second-hand history, even if it doesnâ€™t quite make sense in the modern day.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Thank you to CO.AG for the background music!{% endraw %}
