{% raw %}i was moving around doing missions yes it was solo ina trios plunder but still how did i get kicked for inactivity this time i feel its cause the code that is supposed to detect players inactivity is coded wrong cause how come I can be putting in input and get kicked for allegedly not putting in input? fix your code whoever makes this game I have bitched at and to 50 million people about this problem and this will be my second inactivity video the first one I should've Been kicked it was only 5 minutes worth of me falling to my death over and over not touching my controller at all that should've been considered inactivity not this instance and is partly the reason I don't like playing warzone how come other people can just stand afk for ever and I can be just a tad indecisive on where I wanna go or be cautious and get kicked excuse me for not wanting to run out there and die over and over like the game expects so since that happened yesterday I don't wanna play that crappy game today if it is just gonna kick me like this{% endraw %}
