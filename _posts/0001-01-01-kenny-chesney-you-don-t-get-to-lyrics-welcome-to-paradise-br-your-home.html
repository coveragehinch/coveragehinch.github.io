You just had to mess it up<br />Or is it just some phase you're always going through?<br />To want what you can't have and leave it when you do<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />So you don't get to know what I do with my time<br />You don't get to say you ain't doing alright<br />You don't get to come around saying that you want me now<br />You don't get to show up with that look in your eyes<br />You don't get to think that you can take it all back<br />You don't get to miss what you said we never had<br />I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn<br />After all you put me through, no, you don't get to<br />You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't get to<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />You don't get to kiss me and make it all better<br />You don't get to lay it all out in a letter<br />Blame it on something, break me like it's nothing<br />Just to love me back together<br />And you don't get to show up with your hair hanging down<br />Move a little closer like you're moving right now<br />I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn<br />After all you put me through, no, you don't get to<br />You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't get to<br /><br />You don't get to<br />You don't get to<br /><br />Songwriters: Barry Dean, Dustin Christensen, and Josh Kerr<br />Producers: Kenny Chesney and Ross Copperman<br /><br />.........<br />üë®‚Äçüíª If you like &quot;Kenny Chesney - You Don't Get To&quot; check out these other tracks: <br /><br />- Kenny Chesney - Knowing You (Lyrics)<br />- Kenny Chesney - Tip of My Tongue (Lyrics)<br />- Kenny Chesney - Happy Does (Lyrics)<br />- Teddy Robb - Me on You (Lyrics)<br />- Ryan Hurd - Mississippi to Me (Lyrics)<br /><br />.........<br />Picture credit<br />üì∑ Harli Marten<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/harlimarten/">https://www.instagram.com/harlimarten/</a><br /><br />.........<br />üë©‚Äçüíª Share Kenny Chesney - You Don't Get To with your friends!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4wB-mM87f4Q">https://youtu.be/4wB-mM87f4Q</a><br /><br />Tags<br />#KennyChesney #YouDontGetTo #CountryParadise #Country #ParadiseMusic #WaveMusic #Music #Vocals #Lyrics #TopHits #Hits #LyricVideo #NewCountry #HereAndNow{% endraw %}
