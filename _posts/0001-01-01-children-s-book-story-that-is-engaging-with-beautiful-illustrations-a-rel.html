He has two living companions, a spider and a caterpillar, whom are making plans to become something great. Slowly his friends leave on their exciting journeys, leaving Sid by himself, longing for his own life changing event.   <br /><br />My name is Daniel Pagan and I posted my story because I feel that my story is special, engaging and unique. Children want to learn, to grow! When you are so small, you look toward big things and you dream about being in new places. I feel that my story inspires young readers to let their imaginations run wild. More importantly, my story will show young children that they are a masterpieces waiting to happen.<br /><br />I am a special education teacher living in Kentucky. I also have a Bachelors degree in Art. I am a musician as well and I feel that writing songs has helped me to write my picture book stories. I plan on using Sid the Seed as a teaching tool to inspire kids to reach their full potential.  Please enjoy, let me know where youre from and pass this video on!{% endraw %}
