{% raw %}Happy New Year! We’ve reached the end of 2021 and I for one am looking forward to a jam packed 2022. Today I not only wanted to do a little 2021 year in review / end of the year recap, but also tell you a personal story about something I dealt with in the entertainment industry this last year. You see, I was lucky enough to be offered my very on television show… and I had to reject it. As dramatic and painful as that was though, it didn’t stop us from having the best year ever and won’t hold me back from another year of excellent stuff here on YouTube. Not only will I continue reacting to medical drama’s like Grey’s Anatomy and The Good Doctor, but I’ll keep reacting to more medical memes and TikToks (tag me so I see them!). I’m looking forward to bringing you some original stuff to, like my debut as a real boxer (announcement coming soon!) and this April my first ever live show tour! Rest assured I am not leaving YouTube and our team has got so much fun stuff planned that I can’t wait to share :slightly_smiling_face:<br /><br />INFO AND APPLICATION FOR EDITORS AND MOTION GRAPHICS ARTISTS HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forms.gle/5BVcY9nXthuQ1b7y8">https://forms.gle/5BVcY9nXthuQ1b7y8</a><br /><br /><br />LIVE TOUR: www.doctormikelive.com <br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously.
