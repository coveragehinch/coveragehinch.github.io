{% raw %}It's no secret that people don't like to be told what to do, and I'm as guilty of<br /><br />this as anybody. I know that for me, the more someone tells me that I cannot have<br /><br />fast food,<br /><br />I only want to have fast food all the more. Right? If someone tells me that I<br /><br />can't do something,<br /><br />what I want to do? Exactly that thing. I think that's a fairly common experience.<br /><br />In psychology,<br /><br />this idea is called &quot;reactance,&quot; which means that people don't like to feel<br /><br />like their freedom of choice is being threatened.<br /><br />If I feel like you're making me do something--you're trying to control me--<br /><br />I react really poorly to it. And a lot of times what happens is that people go<br /><br />ahead and do the opposite.<br /><br />They'll do something that completely counters the thing that they feel like<br /><br />they're being made to do. This is a problem for persuaders because what is<br /><br />persuasion and influence but trying to get people to do the things you want<br /><br />them to do? So you need to be careful and know that people aren't going to be<br /><br />super open to the fact that you want to guide their behaviors and opinions.<br /><br />So what do we do? How do we counter reactance?<br /><br />Well there's a very cool principle in psychology called &quot;But You Are Free&quot; -- or at<br /><br />least that's what I call the principle.<br /><br />The idea is that you want to assure people that you're not trying to<br /><br />threaten their freedom to choose and they completely have freedom of choice<br /><br />in this instance. And then ask them to do something for you.<br /><br />Basically, the idea is: reassure people that you're not trying to control them,<br /><br />and they become more influenced by what it is that you have to say.<br /><br />Consider a study that was conducted in France a few years ago.<br /><br />Their goal was to get people to take a simple survey, and they just go up to<br /><br />people and say, &quot;Hey, we're doing a survey around town. We're looking for people to<br /><br />help us out and complete this 5 - 8 minute questionnaire.<br /><br />Would you please do that for us? And the question is: how many times do people say<br /><br />&quot;Yes, I'll take your survey for you&quot;?<br /><br />Well, when they went in cold and they just asked like that,<br /><br />it turns out that about 75% of people did say &quot;yes.&quot;<br /><br />After all, it's only a 5 - 8 minute survey. People are happy to do<br /><br />something like that. But in some instances, they added the &quot;But You Are<br /><br />Free&quot; tactic and opened up their request by saying, &quot;Hello.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We have something to ask of you, but you are of course free to accept or refuse.&quot;<br /><br />And then they asked them to take the survey.<br /><br />Well in this case, compliance rates shot up to 90%.<br /><br />Even though 75% was a pretty good figure, adding just this one<br /><br />little sentence made people more likely to say &quot;yes&quot; to the thing that they were<br /><br />asking them to do. And all it took was telling people that they were free to<br /><br />say &quot;no,&quot; and ironically, that made them more likely to say &quot;yes.&quot; In 2013, a meta-<br /><br />analysis was conducted, which just means they took a whole bunch of different<br /><br />studies and lumped them all together to see if they were reliable across<br /><br />multiple studies. And they found that across 42 different studies, the &quot;But You<br /><br />Are Free&quot; technique is a reliable and effective strategy. They did find that it<br /><br />was more influential when in person -- if you're talking to someone in person and<br /><br />using the&quot;But You Are Free&quot; technique. It's less effective over email.<br /><br />But overall, this is an effective strategy because it reminds people that<br /><br />they're free to say &quot;no.&quot;<br /><br />It assures them that they continue to have autonomy. They can say &quot;yes,&quot; they can<br /><br />say &quot;no&quot;...<br /><br />ultimately it's their choice. And it's so strange to me that reminding people that<br /><br />they can say &quot;no&quot;<br /><br />makes them more likely to say &quot;yes.&quot; So the next time you have a favor to ask, simply<br /><br />add these simple words: &quot;but you are free to say 'no,'&quot; and you might find that people<br /><br />become more likely to say &quot;yes.&quot;<br /><br /><br />----<br /><br />*****************************************************<br /><br />-- FREE Personality Tests:  shorturl.at/gxyBV<br /><br />*****************************************************<br /><br />- Website: shorturl.at/iuBC4<br />- Facebook : shorturl.at/fmCUW<br />- Pinterest: shorturl.at/exK17{% endraw %}
