{% raw %}Audio illusion leaves people split over what crowd are actually saying<br />The question is seemingly a straightforward one: What do you hear when you play this clip?<br />Yet the answer for the millions of people who have listened to the short clip since it appeared on TikTok is proving as divisive as the Yanny or Laurel debate.<br />The seconds-long clip has sparked intense discussion on social media, as people adamantly insist that what they hear is correct.<br />There are a variety of phrases that the viewers of the ear-teaser report hearing.<br />They are: &quot;Bart Simpson bouncing,” “rotating pirate ship,” “that isn't my receipt,” “lobsters in motion,” “that is embarrassing,” “lactates in pharmacy,” and &quot;I'm chasing Martian.&quot;<br />A video uploaded by Kegan Stiles has racked up nearly 12 million hits on TikTok in three days and has been widely shared across various social media channels. <br />Some suggested that football fans would only hear 'That is embarrassing,&quot; but others commented it didn't make a difference to them.<br />&quot;Whatever I read while listening is the one I hear,&quot; one person commented.<br />Another said: &quot;I hear 'That is a person, which isn't even on this list....so that's great!.&quot;<br />A third wrote, &quot;I heard all of them and then I got too 'that is embarrassing' and realised that is probably the right answer.&quot;<br />Another correctly observed: &quot;This is the next 'Laurel or Yanny', I'm calling it.&quot; Scientists say these sort of illusions highlight the difference between hearing and listening - and break down the relationship between stimuli and sense.<br />We hear things in our ears, but listening occurs in the brain, as we attribute meaning to the sound - and clips like this illustrate how they can be tricked.<br />it is the auditory equivalent of Rubin's vase - where some people see two faces and others see a vase.{% endraw %}
