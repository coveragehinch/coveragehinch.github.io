{% raw %}On 5th Feb 2021, Thomas Sargent, Professor in Economics at New York University, joined Luohan Academy in the 3rd Luohan Frontier Dialogue to discuss “Understanding Big Data”. He talked about the beauty and usefulness of differential privacy, the game of which is to construct queries that are invariant to removing people from the dataset. Its spirit is figuring out how to use data and learn from data that you don’t have access to.<br /><br />Luohan's Frontier Dialogues series are organized in the formats of symposia, but differentiate themselves from conventional academic symposia in several ways. The Dialogues are transdisciplinary, where theorists meet with practitioners, and are supported by the knowledge of frontier digital practice and big data. Equally important, we hope we can systematically define and improve our understanding of some of the most critical first-order questions when moving toward a digitized world. Of course, underlining each dialogue is the hope our discussions, insights, and research can make the world a better and more equitable place.<br /><br />For more about Luohan Academy visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.luohanacademy.com/">https://www.luohanacademy.com/</a>{% endraw %}
