The production touches on the slick, acid jazz sound of The Brand New Heavies, adds a dash of vintage Soul II Soul, talks loud and says something… The song itself a message of self-reflection, of looking back, being content with yourself and what you have in life.<br /><br />Written and Produced by Charlie Bierman &amp; Isha Campbell<br />Mastered by Beau @ Ten Eight Seven<br /><br />OUT NOW:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fanlink.to/the-degrees-all-said-and-done">https://fanlink.to/the-degrees-all-said-and-done</a><br /><br />www.1hundred.net<br /><br />Follow The Degrees):<br />Instagram: @thedegrees_<br /><br />Follow Fallen Tree 1Hundred:<br />Instagram: fallentree100<br />Facebook: fallentree100<br />Twitter: FallenTree100{% endraw %}
