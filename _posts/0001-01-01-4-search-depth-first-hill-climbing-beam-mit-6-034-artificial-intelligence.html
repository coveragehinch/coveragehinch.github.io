We end with a brief discussion of commonsense vs. reflective knowledge.<br /><br />License: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA<br />More information at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ocw.mit.edu/terms">http://ocw.mit.edu/terms</a><br />More courses at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ocw.mit.edu">http://ocw.mit.edu</a>{% endraw %}
