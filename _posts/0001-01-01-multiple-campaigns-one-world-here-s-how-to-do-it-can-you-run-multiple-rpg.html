{% raw %}Can you run multiple RPG campaigns with different parties within the same world space? Absolutely! In today's video, I am talking about running multiple campaigns with many different role-players in a single world setting. This can be a somewhat difficult task, particularly when trying to keep track of where the different parties are within your world space. To make this easier for you as the Game Master, we'll talk about the 3 important aspects to take into consideration when running parallel campaigns. So next time you're building your DnD, Pathfinder or Call of Cthulhu based world, try to run different campaigns within that same world and just let the magic happen! <br /><br />Timestamps:  <br />00:00 Introduction <br />02:39 Organisation <br />07:42 Interaction <br />09:12 Impact <br />10:49 Common mistakes <br /><br />Finally playing around a table again?
