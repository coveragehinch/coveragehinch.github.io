{% raw %}The Hymer Master Line is a new and completely redesigned range of motorhomes.  For almost 50 years, the Hymermobil has symbolised motorhomes in general as the embodiment of innovation and “Made in Germany” quality. In April 2019 Hymer released the Hymermobil B-Class MasterLine, an integrated motorhome which combines the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter base and Hymer’s internally developed SLC chassis which has resulted in a state-of-the-art design with a width of 2.35 metres and a headroom of 1.98 metres. It has the 780 and 790 layouts with either joinable single beds or a queen bed offering a spacious double floor as the chassis provides ample space for all technical components.<br /><br />A particular design highlight is the large panoramic windscreen, which merges directly into the slightly curved side walls without visible A-pillars, thus enabling a particularly wide field of view.<br /><br />The extra-wide entrance door, which has been redesigned and ntegrated into the living area, is optionally available with integrated lighting, a closing aid and convenient, key-free access by means of an RFID chip.<br /><br />The large through-loading compartment and the garage with a standard payload of up to 350 kg ensure plenty of space for luggage and camping gear.<br /><br />Power, agility and comfort are hallmarks of the new Mercedes-Benz Sprinter engines, especially the optional 177 hp diesel engine which is available exclusively for motorhomes. In conjunction with the new 6-speed manual gearbox or the 9-speed automatic transmission, it allows high cruising speeds with maximum, low-noise engine smoothness and optimised fuel consumption. Assistance systems also ensure a high degree of safety, such as the Crosswind Assist and Brake Assist System, as well as the DISTRONIC active distance assistant.<br /><br />The exterior of the B-Class MasterLine was developed in collaboration with StudioSYN. To a certain extent, the redesigned front section as far as the front axle lends the motorhome a dynamic appearance – the visible edges pick up the lines of the headlights and carry them into the extended side contour. The slightly blunt-shaped front section integrates the narrower wheelbase.  The sporty, exclusive appearance is further underlined by the black grill and glossy radiator frame with chrome trim, as well as the LED fog lights. The 3D GRP rear, including integrated rear light moulding and self-supporting garage casing, completes the motorhome’s exterior with a sporty and attractive look.<br /><br />The B-Class MasterLine has an interior of bright Grand Oak furniture finish which has been combined with elements in modern super matt white, while the darker Velvet Ash adds exclusive colour accents. The new combinations and accents create harmonious and homely colour schemes, which at the same time look elegant and clean, and are repeated throughout the living area, the bathroom and even the kitchen.<br /><br />A quilted wool fabric provides cosy details in the wardrobe and wall coverings. For further visual enhancement of the cab, all wall areas are covered with fabric-laminated moulded parts, creating a certain symbiosis of living space and cockpit.<br /><br />A large seating area, under which the headrests can be stowed to save space if required, and a spacious kitchen with a large work surface imbue the B-Class MasterLine with a generous sense of space.<br /><br />A new optional solid surface worktop with a large work surface gives the spacious kitchen – including undercounter larder unit – the flair of a luxury household kitchen, and the new double-hinged refrigerator can be conveniently opened in both directions.<br /><br />For additional privacy, the living area can be separated from the sleeping area.<br /><br />The 780 layout has single beds that are over two metres long and almost 90 cm wide, while the 200 cm by 156 cm electrically height-adjustable queen bed is the highlight of the B-Class MasterLine 790.  A feature of the 780 is that it has pull out steps so that one does not have to use a ladder when the the single beds are joined.  Furthermore, when the ladder is out, it does not block the toilet door!<br /><br />The feel-good atmosphere on board is further enhanced by multi-level ambient lighting on the overhead lockers, under the kitchen counter and on the skirting boards. As a new addition to the series, six 2A USB ports are also available in the living area.<br /><br />The shower has headroom of 1.94 metres.<br /><br />There is 180 litres capacity of fresh water and 150 litres of grey water.{% endraw %}
