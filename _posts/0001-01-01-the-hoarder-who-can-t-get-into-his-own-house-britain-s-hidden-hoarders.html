Michael Saunders is a hardworking, well-presented man, but his two houses, in the West Midlands, UK, tell a different story. The front door and windows to one of his semi-detached homes is blocked by seven foot high piles of furniture, bin bags and boxes and both have gardens that could be mistaken for jungles. So Michael has called in extreme cleaners Tee and Caz from N Gervais Extreme Cleaning Team.
