(Also known as Past Progressive Tense and Simple Past Tense)<br /><br />Student Proficiency Level:<br />Pre-intermediate level grammar<br /><br />Suggested Courses:<br />General English.<br /><br />Instructions:<br />– Play the video in class after delivering a warm-up activity first.<br />– Pause the video whenever the narrator asks students a question to give students time to answer. For example, after elicitations and concept checking questions (CCQs).<br /><br />Summary of English Grammar: Past Continuous Tense vs. Past Simple<br />Approximate chronological order:<br /><br />Storyline:<br />– Starts at 0:00. Ends at 2:40.<br /><br />English Grammar Rules and Explanations:<br /><br />Function:<br />– To talk about an action still in progress in the past.<br /><br />Timeline:<br />– Someone was chasing her.<br />– Someone started chasing her in the past, but we don’t know when.<br />– That person stopped chasing her some time in the past. Again, we don’t know when.<br />– We are talking about the whole period from the beginning of the chase to the end.<br /><br />Specific Uses:<br />– Background event:<br />– On a cold dark night, Elissa was working late at the office.<br />– This sentence sets the setting and the background of the story.<br /><br />Simple Past:<br />– To talk about completed or repeated actions.<br />– She quickly ran into the cemetery.<br />– This action is finished and completed.<br />– When we use two simple past actions, the second action happened after the first action. For example,<br />– She quickly ran into the cemetery and hid there.<br />– So she ran into the cemetery first, then she hid inside the cemetery.<br /><br />Combining the Past Progressive Tense with the Simple Past:<br />– Past progressive = longer action<br />– Past simple = shorter action<br />– The shorter action happened while the longer action was still in progress. But sometimes these two actions happen at the same time.<br />– Example: As she was leaving her office, she realised the streets were now empty.<br />– Elissa leaving her office is the longer action.<br />– Elissa realising the streets were empty is the shorter action.<br />– So Elissa was leaving her office and during this time, she noticed the streets were now empty. But she didn’t stop leaving the office when she noticed this.<br /><br />Specific Uses:<br />– Interruption: Sometimes a shorter action interrupted a longer action.<br />– Example: While she was walking back home, she heard some footsteps behind her. She turned around to look.<br />– Elissa walking back home is the longer action.<br />– Hearing the footsteps is the shorter action.<br />– In this case, the footsteps interrupted her walking and made her stop to look back before she continued walking again.<br /><br />Multiple Progressive Actions in the Same Sentence:<br />– Multiple actions happening at the same time.<br />– Example: I was walking home and someone was following me.<br />– We don’t know which action started first.<br />– We also don’t know which action finished first.<br />– We only know that during a certain period in the past these two actions were happening at the same time.<br />– We can use more than two past progressive actions in the same sentence, and all these actions were happening at the same time some time in the past.<br /><br />Form:<br /><br />Statements:<br />Subject + was/were + verb (-ing) + …<br />Elissa + was + working + late.<br /><br />Yes/No Questions:<br />Was/were + subject + verb (-ing) + …?<br />Was + Elissa + working + late?<br /><br />Open Questions:<br />Wh-/How + was/were + subject + verb (-ing) + …?<br />Why + was + Elissa + working + late?<br /><br />Conjunctions:<br />– We use conjunctions to join past simple and progressive actions.<br />– Example conjunctions: while, when, as.<br />– Example sentence 1: While she was walking back home, she heard some footsteps behind her.<br />– Example sentence 2: When Elissa was hiding, the footsteps stopped.<br />– Example sentence 3: As she was running, she saw a cemetery.<br /><br />Switching the Order of the Tenses:<br />– We can also place the simple past action at the front of the sentence before the past continuous action.<br />– Example: She heard some footsteps behind her while she was walking back home.<br /><br />Concept Checking Questions (CCQs){% endraw %}
