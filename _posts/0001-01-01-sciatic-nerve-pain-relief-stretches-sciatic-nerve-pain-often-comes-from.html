{% raw %}Sciatic nerve pain often comes from tight muscles along its pathway. The hamstrings, IT band, and adductors can all contribute to compressing the sciatic nerve. These stretches might help. More sciatic nerve pain stretches:<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/8oPHrX_oALk">https://youtu.be/8oPHrX_oALk</a><br /><br />The first stretch is for the inner hamstrings and adductor muscles. Try to stay in good alignment during the stretch.<br /><br /><br /><br />Next is a sciatic nerve glide or sciatic nerve flossing. This helps get movement if the nerve is compressed somewhere, and it also helps activate the whole nervous system.<br /><br /><br /><br />Finally is a three way hamstring stretch with a strap. This will also help stretch the IT band and adductors as well.<br /><br /><br />Related Videos:<br /><br />Sciatica - Is it Piriformis Syndrome or a Herniated Disc?:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te9-8S5aPCw&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLPS8D21t0eO8bRyNBvm5NULZeCKPsnP3Q&amp;index=41">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te9-8S5aPCw&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLPS8D21t0eO8bRyNBvm5NULZeCKPsnP3Q&amp;index=41</a><br /><br />5 Best Sciatic Stretches for Piriformis Syndrome:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UoITjubrgE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UoITjubrgE</a><br /><br />===========================================<br /><br />Doctor Jo is a Physical Therapist and Doctor of Physical Therapy.<br /><br />SUPPORT Dr. Jo on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo">http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo</a><br /><br />===========================================<br /><br />Sciatic Nerve Pain Relief Stretches:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/iAYFy06z5Bs">https://youtu.be/iAYFy06z5Bs</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.askdoctorjo.com/sciatic-nerve-pain-relief-stretches">https://www.askdoctorjo.com/sciatic-nerve-pain-relief-stretches</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.
