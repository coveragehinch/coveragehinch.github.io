{% raw %}This week on Macro Beauty, we meet MyLinh who is getting a chemical peel for hyperpigmentation. This treatment is done by Krista from Dulce Lash Lounge in Mercer Island, WA. Chemical peels are deep exfoliants that can break up clusters of melanin forming dark spots on skin. The peel sheds old layers and gives way to brighter, new skin. This beauty procedure is more than just skin deep for MyLinh. Watch this episode to learn how the chemical peel process works and why it's meaningful to MyLinh.<br /><br />ABOUT REFINERY29 <br />Refinery29 is a modern woman's destination for how to live a stylish, well-rounded life. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://refinery29.com/">http://refinery29.com/</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO REFINERY29<br />Subscribe to the Refinery29 channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/subscribe-to-r29">http://bit.ly/subscribe-to-r29</a><br />Follow Refinery29 on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/refinery29/">https://instagram.com/refinery29/</a><br />Follow Somos on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/r29somos/">https://instagram.com/r29somos/</a><br />Follow Unbothered on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/r29unbothered/">https://instagram.com/r29unbothered/</a>{% endraw %}
