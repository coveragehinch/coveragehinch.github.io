{% raw %}There's something special about having your own knife. They come in handy in all kinds of situations and could even save your life. To have one on you most of the time in the UK, it needs to be a small, non locking knife and inconspicuous. After all, the handiest tools are the ones you barely know are there until you need them.<br /><br />In this part (1 of 2) you will have the opportunity to follow my own build along. Its very general but will accompany a Written tutorial when i get around to it with all the detailed bit of information.<br /><br />Feel free to throw anycquestions my way and i'll do my best to answer them.<br /><br />MUSIC <br /><br />Nile Blues by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons &quot;Attribution 3.0&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>{% endraw %}
