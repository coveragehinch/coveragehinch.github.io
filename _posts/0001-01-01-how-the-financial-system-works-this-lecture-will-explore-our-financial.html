{% raw %}This lecture will explore our financial system. Why do banks exist, and what do they do with the money that savers lend to them? <br /><br />We’ll explore what risks they face and how they can go bust – even if they make completely safe investments. How does the stock market work – what happens when you trade shares, and why do some companies raise money on the stock market and others don’t? Can ordinary citizens influence how the money they save is used?<br /><br />A lecture by Alex Edmans<br /><br />The transcript and downloadable versions of the lecture are available from the Gresham College website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/financial-system">https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/financial-system</a><br /><br />Gresham College has offered free public lectures for over 400 years, thanks to the generosity of our supporters.
