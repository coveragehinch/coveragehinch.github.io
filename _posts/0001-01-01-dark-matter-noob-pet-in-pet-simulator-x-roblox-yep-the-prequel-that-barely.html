{% raw %}yep. the prequel that barely any pet simulator veteran asked for. i did this for fun/entertainment purposes so hopefully it's ok.<br /><br />if you're reading this, i'll probably give away the noob pet to a random fan if this video manages to get 200 likes. i don't expect it to get that far, so i may be keeping the dark matter noob pet for a long while. lol<br /><br />edit: dang. i was not expecting this to blow up. it appears that you somewhat decided to read the description, and for that, here's a lil teaser: I'm waiting for another DM pet to be made.<br /><br />I've made a group you can join in case you want to hang out, or buy my outfit. join here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/groups/4491887/The-Adventurers-HQ#!/about">https://www.roblox.com/groups/4491887/The-Adventurers-HQ#!/about</a><br /><br />#Roblox #PetSimulatorX{% endraw %}
