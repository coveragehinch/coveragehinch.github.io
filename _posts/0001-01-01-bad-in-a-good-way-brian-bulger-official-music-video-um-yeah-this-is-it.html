{% raw %}Um yeah this is it :)<br /><br />Directed by Micah Coss<br />Song produced, mixed, and mastered by Ephraim McFarland<br />Drums by Luke Ford<br />Pedal Steel by Gideon Boley<br />Written by Brian Bulger<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Feels like I’m on the last bend<br />Of the deep end<br />But the drowning has<br />Been just fine<br />And when my ears pop<br />And the shell shock<br />Of this pit stop<br />Frees my mind<br />I’ll be alright <br />I can go there now that I’ve stared death in the face<br /><br />Doesn’t it always seem like the parts that made us laugh now make us cry<br />Doesn’t it always seem like the villain pulling the strings is a regular guy<br />You and me have gone bad in a good way<br />I promise<br />The kerosene wipes clean what we couldn’t bear to tarnish<br />I’ll be alright<br />I can go there now that I’ve stared death in the face <br /><br />There’s a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit<br />Whitewashed hymns and the deadliest sins pushed me to my limit <br />But when you deconstruct you’re shit out of luck for a minute<br />But after the last bend you can break it all down to rebuild it <br /><br />You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise{% endraw %}
