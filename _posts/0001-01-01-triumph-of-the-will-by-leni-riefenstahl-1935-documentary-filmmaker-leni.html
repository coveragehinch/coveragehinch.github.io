{% raw %}Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl's controversial masterwork is an artful work of propaganda showcasing German chancellor and Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler at the 1934 Nuremberg Rally. Edited from over 60 hours' worth of raw footage shot over the course of the rally's four days, the film is visually remarkable in the way it captures the event's enormous scale. Riefenstahl's portentous filming from low angles (to make the small-framed Hitler look imposing and majestic) is often copied and parodied.<br />Release date: March 28, 1935 (Germany)<br />Director: Leni Riefenstahl<br />Music by: Herbert Windt<br />Cinematography: Sepp Allgeier; Franz Weihmayr<br />Production company: Reichsparteitag-Film<br />Language: German{% endraw %}
