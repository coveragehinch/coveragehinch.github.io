{% raw %}Get New CAN'T SLOW DOWN Shirts Here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cantslowdown.com">http://www.cantslowdown.com</a><br />W e decided to swap an electric motor and battery system from a hybrid road cruiser to a BMX trick bike! We are not professionals and we had to DIY this whole project but we did figure it out and it actually worked! We decided to test it out by setting up our jump ramp and we also decided to put the motor on backwards and decided to make a  backwards riding electric fake bike as well!{% endraw %}
