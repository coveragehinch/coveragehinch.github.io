{% raw %}Ultimate Fact Pretenses Things Most Humans Can't Do. The human body is just amazing with all the organs in it, but despite all that stuff inside of us, there are interesting things it can’t just do. However, few people can do most of those things so easily. Let’s look at top 20 things most humans can’t do. <br />1. Putting your foot behind your head<br />It requires extreme flexibility, win order to put your feet behind your head. To some gymnasts placing feet behind their heads may sound a bit easy, but it may be entirely impossible for ordinary people. Look at how these guys are doing things most people are unable to do. <br />2. Tongue tricks<br />If you dint know what else the tongue can do, look at these select few tricks. Splitting the tongue, rolling it, flipping it 180 degrees, and performing a reverse are all cool tricks. It's heavily debated whether these tricks are genetic or can be learned. If you thought these are things kids cannot do, studies have shown that some children can perform tongue tricks even when both parents couldn’t dos so. <br />3. Gleeking  <br />This is a smart little trick courtesy of your salivary glands. It’s basically spitting a jet of saliva from your submandibular glands upon compressing it with your tongue. It is a human equivalent of a camel spit, and only a few can do it. You may have accidentally done it when visiting a dentist or yawning. This is one of the fantastic body tricks most people can’t do. Gleeking is basically an involuntary act, and only a lucky few can perform this saliva spit on command.<br />4. Open eye sneezing<br />Among the impossible things, most humans can't do is sneezing with their eyes open. You may have noticed your eyes automatically shut whenever you sneeze well; that's not the case for everybody. <br />5. Nose twitching<br />If you ever watched bewitched, you must have tried to twitch your nose like Samantha without success. It’s one of the amazing body tricks most people can’t do, perhaps because it’s not a universal talent. <br />8. Lick your elbow<br />Most people can easily bend their arm or elbow, and most people can easily slip their tongue out, but most people can’t do them together. Licking your elbow is one of the weirdest funky things most people can’t do. <br />9. Wiggling your ears<br />Ear wiggling is one of the most amazing body tricks most people can’t do, although you can train yourself to wiggle your ear by simply isolating your ear wiggling muscle. To be honest, it’s a lot harder than it seems; just practice wiggling your ears without moving any other part of your face and let us know how it goes.<br />11. Tickling yourself<br />Tickling yourself to the point of laughter is among the things most humans can’t do, and it’s practically impossible. This is because you always brace for the touch, and your body doesn't react the same when someone else tickles you. <br />15. Raising one single eyebrow<br />Facial expressions, oh, yes! In order to identify with someone, they know people tend to use different signs like raising their fist, smiling, or raising their eyebrows. Although this sounds easy, some people can't raise one eyebrow by itself. Now you may be thinking you can do it and even trying it out, but you can’t. <br />17. Wiggling your little toe<br />While moving the big toe is reasonably straight forward, wiggling the small toe is a whole matter. You may manage to move it after considerable effort but will notice that the toe next to it is moving too. This body trick is one simple thing most humans can’t do. <br />18. The chair experiment<br />You must try this to believe it! An exercise that most women can manage easily, while men can’t do it. Let’s go, stand with your two feet against the wall, take two steps back in a straight line, put your feet together, lean forward with your head touching the wall, pick the chair up and try to stand up. While ladies often do this easily, it is staggeringly difficult for men. The chair challenge proves to be one of the simple things most men cannot do.<br />19. Milk squirting from your eyes <br />Well, this is actually the video of the day, how on earth would you take in milk either with your mouth or nose and let it squirt from your eyes? It seems like fun, but these are things most people can't do with their bodies. Some people do insanely dangerous things we are yet to see if this particular talent or skill will get onto the Guinness book of records. Meanwhile, don’t try it at home.<br />Which of these weird funky things can you do? Do you have any friend who can do any of these?
