{% raw %}Thailand has relaxed its quarantine restrictions and is reopening to vaccinated travellers arriving from several dozen countries and territories. It's expected the move - which includes Australia, the United States, the UK, India, China and Canada - to name a few, will provide a much-needed boost for the country's embattled tourism industry. <br /><br />Now, as of November 1, fully vaccinated travellers who have stayed a minimum of 21 days in one of 63 approved low risk countries and territories can avoid a lengthy hotel quarantine for the first time in more than 18 months.<br /><br />Instead, incoming travellers who meet the updated requirements will only need to stay one night in a government-approved hotel while they await the results of a COVID-19 test that will be administered upon arrival. Visitors under the age of 12 who are traveling with their parents are exempt from the vaccination requirement.<br /><br />Fully vaccinated travellers arriving from countries not on the list are eligible to enter through a sandbox scheme that requires them to stay in a government-approved hotel or resort in one of 17  destinations, including Phuket, Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Koh Samui, for seven nights before<br />they will be allowed to travel freely in the country.<br /><br />You can find out all you need on travelling to Thailand here via the country’s Tourism<br />Authority website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tatnews.org/thailand-reopening/">https://www.tatnews.org/thailand-reopening/</a>{% endraw %}
