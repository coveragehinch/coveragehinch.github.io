{% raw %}microscopes - resolution, field of view and depth of field Depth of field refers to the range of distance that appears acceptably sharp. It varies depending on camera type, aperture and focusing distance, although print size and viewing distance can also influence our perception of depth of field. --- Microscopes have a special property, called &quot;being PARFOCAL&quot; which means that once the object is focus and centered using the 4X, when you switch to the next highest objective, your specimen will be relatively centered and in focus. You should only have to make MINOR adjustments to the FINE FOCUS and the STAGE POSITION, in order to view your object at the higher objective. If you have difficulty, you must go back to 4X and recenter and refocus!<br /><br />The field of view DECREASES as you INCREASE magnification.<br />The amount of light observed through the microscope gets dimmer (is reduced) as you increase magnification.<br />You should notice that the image you see is UP-SIDE-DOWN and REVERSED (the is INVERSION).<br />This means the object will appear to move in the OPPOSITE direct as it is being moved in reality.<br />You should notice that your DEPTH OF FOCUS decreases as magnification INCREASES. This means that with a relatively small movement of the fine focus knob, you could be out of the focal range. For looking at cells, you will notice you will see fewer layers of cells at higher magnifications.<br />You can measure the actual length of your field of view by viewing a ruler or standardized grid with millimeter demarcations using the 10 X objective. count the number of mm in your field of view, then convert to micrometers. (1000um = 1mm).<br />The field of view DECREASES as you INCREASE magnification.<br />• Dimming Effect - The amount of light observed through the microscope gets dimmer (is reduced) as you increase magnification.<br />•  INVERSION - You should notice that the image you see is UP-SIDE-DOWN and REVERSED (this is INVERSION). This means the object will appear to move in the OPPOSITE direct as it is being moved in reality<br />• DEPTH OF FOCUS decreases as magnification INCREASES. This means that with a relatively small movement of the fine focus knob, you could be out of the focal range. For looking at cells, you will notice you will see fewer layers of cells at higher magnifications. When considering resolution in optical microscopy, a majority of the emphasis is placed on point-to-point lateral resolution in the plane perpendicular to the optical axis (Figure 1). Another important aspect to resolution is the axial (or longitudinal) resolving power of an objective, which is measured parallel to the optical axis and is most often referred to as depth of field.<br />Axial resolution, like horizontal resolution, is determined only by the numerical aperture of the objective (Figure 2), with the eyepiece merely magnifying the details resolved and projected into the intermediate image plane. Just as in classical photography, depth of field is determined by the distance from the nearest object plane in focus to that of the farthest plane also simultaneously in focus. In microscopy depth of field is very short and usually measured in units of microns. The term depth of focus, which refers to image space, is often used interchangeably with depth of field, which refers to object space.<br /><br />This interchange of nomenclature can lead to confusion, especially when the terms are both used specifically to denote depth of field in microscope objectives. The geometric image plane might be expected to represent an infinitely thin section of the specimen, but even in the absence of aberrations, each image point is spread into a diffraction figure that extends above and below this plane. The Airy disk, a basic unit of the diffraction pattern produced by the microscope objective, represents a section through the center of the intermediate image plane. This increases the effective in-focus depth of the Z-axis Airy disk intensity profile that passes through slightly different specimen planes.{% endraw %}
