{% raw %}Loving Ourselves into Healing (Part 1), with Tara Brach [2021-12-15]<br /><br />We are often at war with our difficult emotionsâ€”judging and hating ourselves for our fear, anger, clinging or shame.  And as a society, we turn on others as lesser or bad, as the enemy.   These talks explore how, in both domains, our continued evolution, healing and freedom depends on learning how to embrace what we have pushed away.  <br /><br />******************************************************<br /><br />You can now order Tara's new book, Radical Compassion, at the following link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tarabrach.com/radical-compassion">https://www.tarabrach.com/radical-compassion</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Tara's podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tara-brach/id265264862?mt=2">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tara-brach/id265264862?mt=2</a><br /> <br />Join Tara's email community to receive exclusive updates, events, meditations: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tarabrach.com/join-email-list/">https://www.tarabrach.com/join-email-list/</a>  <br /><br />Your support will enable us to continue to offer these talks freely.
