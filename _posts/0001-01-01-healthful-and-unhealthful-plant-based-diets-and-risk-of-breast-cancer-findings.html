{% raw %}Findings from a new epidemiological study suggest that adherence to a plant-based dietary pattern and, specifically, its healthful version [whole grains, fruits/vegetables, nuts/legumes, oils, tea/coffee], may reduce the risk of breast cancer, especially those that are more likely to be aggressive tumors (ER-negative breast cancer). In contrast, a low-quality plant-based diet [(juices/sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes/fries, sweets) and animal foods] may be associated with an increased risk of ER-negative breast cancer.<br /><br />ABOUT THE AUTHOR OF THIS VIDEO:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Fontana_(medical_researcher)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Fontana_(medical_researcher)</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q7oQtGIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q7oQtGIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en</a><br /><br />BOOKS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Luigi-Fontana/e/B093ZTVFLP/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_ebooks_1">https://www.amazon.com/Luigi-Fontana/e/B093ZTVFLP/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_ebooks_1</a><br /><br />KEY SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5976/321.abstract">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5976/321.abstract</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/446346">https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/446346</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(15)00186-5.pdf">https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(15)00186-5.pdf</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165614709002028">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165614709002028</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/511405a">https://www.nature.com/articles/511405a</a>{% endraw %}
