So what better way than to start rounding off the video by looking back over our 2021 goals and seeing if we achieved them...Check out the video where I set these goals for a trip down memory lane:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wgz-DrkS2Fc">https://youtu.be/wgz-DrkS2Fc</a><br /><br />Thank you so much for a fantastic 2021 and I have loved every second of our interactions over the past 12 months! I hope you stick around to see what 2022 can bring for the future..<br /><br />If you have been following me for a while, you will know that in September I done a 10k charity run for Cancer Research UK. This is an illness that has affected several members of my family (including my little kitty Elvis in heaven) and I know that it has most definitely affected many, many other families. Any donations are greatly appreciated, but if you are unable to, thank you for taking the time to read this section:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fundraise.cancerresearchuk.org/page/shannons-race-for-life-3814">https://fundraise.cancerresearchuk.org/page/shannons-race-for-life-3814</a><br /><br />Fancy watching another video...have a look at the below playlists:<br /><br />'Time For A Getaway' Playlist: This is where you can find all our UK staycations and holidays abroad! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7i6EHFa5DKlk-FqjJIKG_oCCuDhzlPck">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7i6EHFa5DKlk-FqjJIKG_oCCuDhzlPck</a><br />'Autumn/Winter 2021...'
