{% raw %}It took $90,000 to buy 2008 Audi R8 that “just needed a piston and a sleeve” and rebuild it. This is the entire story, and the first wide open throttle pulls I've ever made in the car. Since then I found that no shop will tackle an engine that needs custom pistons and sleeves made. Replaced it with a brand new engine from Audi, dropped it off at Heffner in Florida to have my work checked, drove it home on a stock tune with no throttle, and spent the next 6 months working on getting it tuned. Now we’re driving it across the finish line and it’s an incredible feeling.<br /><br />HUGE THANK YOU TO BOOSTED EURO FOR BEING THE ONLY SHOP THAT COULD TUNE THIS CAR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.boostedeuro.com/">https://www.boostedeuro.com/</a><br /><br />Check them out or give them a follow: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BoostedEURO/">https://www.facebook.com/BoostedEURO/</a><br /><br />Massive thank you to Heffner Performance for supporting a legacy build a guy put together in his garage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://heffnerperformance.com">http://heffnerperformance.com</a><br /><br />Walser Audi of Wichita for helping with questions and getting parts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.audiwichita.com">https://www.audiwichita.com</a><br /><br />Prime Cuts Chop Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.primecutschopshop.com/">https://www.primecutschopshop.com/</a><br /><br />MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shopWatchJRGo.com">http://shopWatchJRGo.com</a><br />Shop Motul: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://motul.com">http://motul.com</a><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Common Questions:<br /><br />What motorcycle do I ride?
