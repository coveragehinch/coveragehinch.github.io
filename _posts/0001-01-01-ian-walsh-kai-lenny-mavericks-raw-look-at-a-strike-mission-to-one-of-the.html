This also creates a unique opportunity to push himself. Which is what he is really after. <br /><br />But let's get to the real reason you're here... KITCHEN CAPTAIN! On this channel, you're going to be thoroughly entertained while learning how to cook at home. Weekly cooking episodes will be served up and there might be a sprinkle or two of high-quality surfing videos. This is not a Michelin star chef show. This is the everyman cooking show in your own kitchen. If Ian can learn to cook it, then so can you. Cooking doesn't need to be hard, but it does need to taste good. There will be mistakes, there will be laughs, and there will be some damn good recipes learned! Put your helmet on, hit that SUBSCRIBE button, and buckle up! Let's go!{% endraw %}
