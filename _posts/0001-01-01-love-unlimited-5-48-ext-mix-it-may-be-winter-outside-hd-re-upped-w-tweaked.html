{% raw %}Re-upped, w/ tweaked video and re-done audio, I put together a true proper extended version of this Barry White written and produced gem from Love Unlimited's 1973 album &quot;Under The Influence&quot;.. another under-recognized classic and one of my favorite pop songs of all time. ..AND This is NOT the same version that appears on the 2009 Barry White box set promoted at the right. I hope you enjoy it.{% endraw %}
