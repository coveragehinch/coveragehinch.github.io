{% raw %}Composed in 1967. by John Carter and Ken Lewis ,&quot;Let's Go to San Francisco&quot; is the only UK-charting single by the British pop group “The Flower Pot Men”, group which sound was characterized by rich, three-part vocal harmonies.<br />Group`s name “The Flower Pot Men” was derived from the BBC children's show Flower Pot Men, with the obvious psychedelic era puns on flower power and &quot;pot&quot; (cannabis.).<br />Cute song that instantly recalls me to late sixties and San Francisco. To us living somewhere else, San Francisco seems like frozen in some other time. . <br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I do not own the rights to the original song and artwork. This video was made with the main aim to PROMOTE THE MUSIC AND THE ARTIST. Buy the music and support the artists!{% endraw %}
