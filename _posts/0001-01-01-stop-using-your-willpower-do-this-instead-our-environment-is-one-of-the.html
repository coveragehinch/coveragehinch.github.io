{% raw %}Our environment is one of the invisible forces that shapes human behavior.<br />We would like to think that the choices we make are our own and not influenced by external factors.<br />The truth however, is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped by the most easy and obvious option.<br /><br />If you're overweight, a smoker or a video game addict, you might think that it's because you lack the willpower to quit.<br />Research however, shows something different. <br />When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous amounts of willpower, it turns out those individuals are not different than you.<br /><br />Instead, the evidence says that disciplined people are better at optimizing their environment in a way that does not require massive amounts of willpower.<br />Good behavior is easy for them, simply because they optimized their surroundings in a way that supports it.<br /><br />In the short run, you can choose to overpower temptation. However in the long run, you become a product of the environment that you live in.<br /><br />Images Â© Piers Baker www.svgdoodlewhiteboard.com{% endraw %}
