listen very hard<br />When she told me she was crazy from the start<br />She put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)<br />I said she was a work of art (Work of art)<br />I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)<br />When she told me she was crazy from the start<br /><br />[Verse 1]<br />I drive down open roads so slow<br />Here comes a train, I'll let it go<br />Ain't got nobody on my phone<br />Don't like being all alone (Don't like being all alone)<br />Not good at keeping with the trends (No, no)<br />Too good at welcoming amends<br />It's been a while since I've heard her say<br />That we were more than friends (Oh)<br />Oh, I, I-I-I, know a lot is going on<br />But girl, please tell me<br />And I'll let you be<br />Are you still with me or not?<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />She put my name with yellow hearts<br />Her favorite color, like the stars<br />I didn't listen very hard<br />When she told me she was crazy from the start<br />She put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)<br />I said she was a work of art (Work of art)<br />I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)<br />When she told me she was crazy from the start<br /><br />[Refrain]<br />She put yellow hearts around my name<br />I thought they were all just the same<br />To you, what do they really mean?<br />Have you only been playing games?<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />I'm by the garden with the carpenter bees<br />Like I'm Bob Ross-in' with a Harden beard<br />Taking it all in like I got no issues in my nature<br />Primroses blooming in the night<br />Birds wanna take me on a flight<br />Appreciating my land 'fore it turns into a glacier<br />Chasers are of no good use<br />This taste will be long endured<br />Why'd you have to go so soon?<br />I thought this was as good as new<br /><br />[Interlude]<br />She put yellow hearts around my name<br />I thought they were all just the same<br />To you, what do they really mean?<br />Have you only been playing games?<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />She put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)<br />Her favorite color, like the stars (Like the stars)<br />I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)<br />When she told me she was crazy from the start<br />She put my name with yellow hearts (She put yellow hearts around my name)<br />I said she was a work of art (I thought they were all just the same)<br />I didn't listen very hard (To you, what do they really mean?)<br />When she told me she was crazy from the start (Have you only been playing games?)<br /><br />[Outro]<br />Have you only been playing games?<br />No, no<br /><br />Wallpaper: unsplash.com<br /><br />I don't own the music in this video.
