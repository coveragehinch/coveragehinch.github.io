{% raw %}One of the most important principles that the religious tradition of Sanatana Dharma teaches us is that we are at all times surrounded by the blessings and grace of God. Despite the fact that God is always bestowing His blessings upon us, many of us struggle to be aware of God’s tremendous gifts in our lives. In this exclusive talk that was delivered February 27, 2001 on the ISDS Discord server, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya shares with us the nature of God’s blessings, as well as the importance of cultivating a deeper sense of appreciation, gratitude and thanksgiving in our lives. If you wish to receive God's blessings, then be a blessing in the lives of others.<br /><br />_____________________________<br />Please share this important video on as many social media platforms as you can.
