Swaps right now are MEX over EGLD oriented. You will most likely also lose in total LP value, in the short term, and as long as MEX is down and EGLD is volatile.<br />- The more liquidity you add, the more the RPA decreases.<br />- The more people come into the pool, the more the % drop.<br />- We are in week 2 of 52. The boost of rewards falls by about 25% each week (Saturday to Friday) until week 7 then it will stabilize from week 8 to week 52<br />- DEX is not yet connected to the external ecosystems which does not help MEX liquidity. Automated bridges are being developed.<br />- Confidence is there, the community has contributed more than 1 billion in EGLD, the number of accounts is increasing every day by more than 2K. Other pools, bridges, launchpad projects are already planned.<br />I am very confident for the future of EGLD AND MEX.”<br /><br />by EncrEor<br />                                                                                                <br />______________________________________<br /><br />Useful Info:<br /><br />Dr. Elrond's summary:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3dfSZXW">https://bit.ly/3dfSZXW</a><br /><br />Official Update:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/31reKl9">https://bit.ly/31reKl9</a><br /><br />MEX Price Prediction:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3omOst4">https://bit.ly/3omOst4</a><br /><br /><br />#MaiarDEX #ElrondNetwork #MaiarExchange #HoustonStrategy{% endraw %}
