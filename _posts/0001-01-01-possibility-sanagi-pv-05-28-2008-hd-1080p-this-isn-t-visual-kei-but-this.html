{% raw %}This isn't visual kei, but this is one of my favorite j-rock songs that I haven't seen the PV for online for! This post I won't really be promoting or anything, so please enjoy some casual Japanese rock \m/! <br /><br />&quot;sanagi&quot; is the eighth single (fourth major label single) released by POSSIBILITY. The main was chosen to be the fourth ending theme of the anime Gintama. The single reached #17 on the Oricon charts and charted for six weeks, selling 11,836 copies. It's the group's most successfull single so far.<br /><br />If you'd like to follow me, or check me out on other sites, please do so by these links!<br />Video I am in with Justin Whang: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpjET2V95eE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpjET2V95eE</a><br />My Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/visualkeikatt">https://twitter.com/visualkeikatt</a><br />My Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://visualkeikatt.weebly.com/">https://visualkeikatt.weebly.com/</a><br />My Phantasmagoria Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3CXCtIBXe2eZ8hm4ETTiVJgHUt2gHjI">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3CXCtIBXe2eZ8hm4ETTiVJgHUt2gHjI</a><br />My Personal Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3CXCtIBXe1QqOA4FErhkh2yVSMxKQ-C">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3CXCtIBXe1QqOA4FErhkh2yVSMxKQ-C</a>{% endraw %}
