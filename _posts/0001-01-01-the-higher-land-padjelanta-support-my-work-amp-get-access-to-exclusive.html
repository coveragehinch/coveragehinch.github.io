I used a packraft to be able to travel more freely on the lakes and cross some rivers that would be impossible on foot. <br /><br />I hope this film can convey the feeling of being alone out there in this beautiful part of the Swedish mountains. I want to say a special thanks to those of you who are supporting my work over at my website.
