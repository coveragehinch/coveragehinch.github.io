We do not have the battery capacity or data storage to film in real time as our cruises can last up to 7 or 8 hours. We use to the time-lapse footage to help tell the story of movement rather than showcase the scenery. We limit the amount of time-lapse shots we use in each vlog.<br /><br />Q• Why are your video's so behind?<br />A• We would love to release all our video's in the same week that we film them but that isn't possible for us. Jo only really has the capacity to edit two video's per week and as we make a video for each cruise that we do and we some times cruise 3 or 4 or 5 times a week we inevitably get behind. We fit in the vlogs around our lives not the other way round.{% endraw %}
