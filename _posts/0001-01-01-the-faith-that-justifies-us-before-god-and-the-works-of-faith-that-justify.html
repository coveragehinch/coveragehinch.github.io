{% raw %}James 2:22 states: “βλέπεις ὅτι ἡ πίστις συνήργει τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἔργων ἡ πίστις ἐτελειώθη”<br />The term, G991 βλέπω, is a term referring to sight according to the act of seeing “with the bodily eye: to be possessed of sight, have the power of seeing.”<br />So, the use by James in reference to works of faith that can be seen literally refers to the reality of being seen with the bodily eye. <br />The term, G5048 τελειόω, which means “to make perfect, complete; to carry through completely, to accomplish, finish, bring to an end, to complete (perfect).” <br />Martin (1980) stated: “Lest there be any confusion at this point, let us clearly grasp the fact that “good works” can never save or justify the soul before God…This extremely dogmatic teaching runs throughout the entire New Testament, particularly in what is termed “Pauline theology,” a fact evidenced in his preoccupation with it in Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, and, oddly enough, with its practical application in the Epistle to Philemon. <br />But to return to the core of the matter, “good works” justify us before men in that they give tangible proof of our prior justification before God, which is solely on the basis of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br />…the Apostle carries this out to its logical conclusion when in the same chapter he teaches that the Christian’s “present bodily life is lived by faith in the Son of God” (Galatians 2:20 NEB), a faith which has as its natural outgrowth “a pattern of good works” (Titus 2:7)…We must understand, then, that faith and works can never in themselves (or together for that matter) save anyone. It is sovereign grace alone that forms the basis for eternal salvation.<br />Good works “complete” the testimony of faith by witnessing to the fact of that faith’s existence; they serve to justify us before men, who cannot see the grace or the faith that has already justified us before God…Unregenerate men cannot perceive the reality of our faith apart from our works performed for Christ. Such works have no merit in themselves, the Scripture reminds us (Ephesians 2:9), but they do indeed “justify” our faith and testify to its existence before a skeptical and hostile world. This is the whole sense of the Apostle James’ scathing pronouncement that “as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also” (James 2:26). <br />James never taught that works justify the soul before God, as some who ignore the context of his remarks and the complete meaning of justification (before God and before man) imply, for he was well acquainted with Paul’s teaching on the subject and concurred in it” (Essential Christianity: A Handbook of Basic Christian Doctrines 1980 Regal Books).{% endraw %}
