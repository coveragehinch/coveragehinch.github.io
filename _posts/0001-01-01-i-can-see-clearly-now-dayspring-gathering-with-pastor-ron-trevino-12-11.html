{% raw %}12/11/2021 Dayspring Commission Gathering <br /><br />“Do you know that we become mature as we experience storms during our life?  God permits challenges to mature us and to grow us into a place of profoundness.  He moves us forward in precision, like an arrow hitting the bullseye!  Today, we learn from Pastor Ron Trevino how to live a life of precision, a life based upon strategic plans from God.<br />God wants us to “see” friends and family in a new and different way.  He wants to bring spiritual depth into our life so that we can share with others.  The Holy Spirit is the lens to reveal God to us and to see what it is we need to see.  The Holy Spirit gives us a viewpoint from God that enables us to see clearly!  If you are a person without a vision or plan, do not despair, for God’s vision is available to you.  If you have no vision, Jesus is the One to lead you, the One you need to follow, for He will give you the plan and vision.<br />Let Jesus touch that area of your life and heal you.  We need to get a Word from God to heal our areas of disability, weakness and need!  When we hear right, we speak right.  Jesus is getting ready to touch us now so that we can see what God wants us to do during our lifetime. <br />When there is no vision, we will perish.  We can have site, but no vision.  Vision is the eyes of your heart, not you head.  God’s vision is within your heart.  When you have vision, you live; without vision, there is no fulfillment, and you die.  You need prophetic vision, a glimpse into the future will enable you to stop complaining about today and speak hope into the future. <br />You need to get a Word from God to heal your areas of disability, weakness and need!  When you hear right, you speak right.  Jesus is getting ready to touch you now so that you can see what God wants you to do.  Open your hearts, fellow believers, for the Word of God has been shared with you today in this powerful video from Pastor Ron Trevino!   Thank you, Pastor Ron!  www.DayspringCommission.org{% endraw %}
