Elmo Picasso here is of the Brahman breed, which means he; is very tolerant of heat, sunlight, and even humidity. No wonder he's been walking around in the sun without any problem! Moreover, this breed tends to love older than any other, which means Elmo is just going to get bigger in the future. For now, he's about 2835 pounds and lives in Australia. <br /><br />The Australian can get really harsh, but Elmo can handle it! Other than that, he's safe from the native creepy crawlers because of the incredibly thick skin that helps him avoid any insects. In the middle east, brahman bulls are used in bull-butting, which is basically two bulls headbutting each other till one collapses. Luckily, he won't have to deal with any of that!<br /><br />Juancho - 2645 pounds<br /><br />You would think that a 2645 pound bull would be a lazy one. But not Juancho! This one has the energy of a horse and even runs like one. He's an Ongole bull which is one of the heaviest breeds, so it's no surprise that he's huge! In fact, their size has helped them become some of the toughest and incredibly tolerant bulls. That's not all. <br /><br />This was also the Indian breed that was the first breed to gain worldwide recognition. Juancho is just practicing before his actual power work starts. Either that or Juancho will be used as a fighter bull as that's what he's mainly bred from!<br /><br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at: factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
