{% raw %}There is a workaround for getting the Mr &amp; Mrs or Partners names merged from the contact manager into both the card and onto the envelope. This video touches on a few key principles for doing so. Forgive a few sound hiccups - I didn't want to spend a lot of time on cleanup when it is good enough. <br /><br />Here's a link to a step-by-step for getting this to work for you:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ip7mQG">https://goo.gl/ip7mQG</a><br /><br />Yes, this is an &quot;inelegant&quot; solution to the problem by creating near-duplicate records in the account. In larger contact lists this could cause a user to top out their storage limits and prematurely force them to move to a premium package. And there will still be contacts that will not fit easily into this workaround. Still, it is a way to get around the &quot;first name&quot; field printing one spouse name on the envelope when it is addressed to two. <br /><br />You have to realize that the dynamic is that some spouses will be offended by and will not open mail addressed to only their spouse.{% endraw %}
