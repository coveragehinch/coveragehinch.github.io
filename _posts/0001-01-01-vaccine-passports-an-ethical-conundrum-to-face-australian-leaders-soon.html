{% raw %}Sky News host Rita Panahi says she has no doubt vaccine passports will be popular in Australia, but surely it is better to encourage people to be vaccinated rather than “bully them into submission”.<br /><br />“Vaccine passports will undoubtedly incentivise the apathetic to get jabbed,” she said.<br /><br />“But do they cross the line into coercion and breach the human rights of the individual? Such ethical conundrums will face our elected leaders soon.”<br /><br />Ms Panahi noted UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson came “under fire” for backing vaccine passports, meanwhile mass protests have been sparked in France after President Emmanuel Macron announced digital certificates will be needed from August.<br /><br />“It’s been a very different story in the US where each state decides whether vaccine passports will be used,” she said.<br /><br />“Real leaders use persuasion not coercion to boost the vaccination rate. It remains to be seen what Scott Morrison will do.”{% endraw %}
