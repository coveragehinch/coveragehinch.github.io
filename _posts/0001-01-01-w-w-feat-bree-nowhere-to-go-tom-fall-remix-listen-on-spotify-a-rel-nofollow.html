Four years after their 'Mustang' burst onto the scene, the hands of time pointed to the next step in their young career: debut album 'Impact'. Now that Willem and Ward started following the big path to success, it's only a matter of enjoying the wild ride it takes them on.<br /><br />After premiering their first vocal single, 'Three O'Clock' feat. Ana Criada, dance land was pleasantly surprised to hear that the boys didn't only perform magic on big-room instrumentals, but also know how to get a floor moving with a pair of quality vocals. And so, W&amp;W pleases the ears with another vocal anthem: 'Nowhere To Go'. Balancing all the goods of an energetic tech-trance instrumental with the powerful voice of US singer Bree, 'Nowhere To Go' takes you sky-high, right there on the dance floor.<br /><br />If you're longing for that tad bit of uplifting, try the Shogun remix. The US-based producer/DJ rocks 'Nowhere To Go' with a super-sizing trance stir, providing a tasty peak-timer on the side. Finnish producer Tom Fall completes the pack with a tricky but tasty prog-house remix, smashing the pack with heavy, distorted electro stabs, furious bass and a whole lot of peak-time trouble!<br /><br /><br /><br />Tracklist<br /><br />1.Nowhere To Go (Original Mix)<br /><br />2.Nowhere To Go (Shogun Remix)<br /><br />3.Nowhere To Go (Tom Fall Remix)<br /><br />4.Nowhere To Go (Radio Edit)<br /><br />5.Nowhere To Go (Alternative Radio Edit){% endraw %}
