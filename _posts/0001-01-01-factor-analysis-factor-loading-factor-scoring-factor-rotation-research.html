Output of a simple factor analysis looking at indicators of wealth, with just six variables and two resulting factors <br />6 variables: Income, education, occupation, house value, public parks and crimes <br />2 factors: individual socioeconomic status and neighborhood socioeconomic status<br />Factor Score – if value of variables are given then factor values can be predicted<br />Interpretation{% endraw %}
