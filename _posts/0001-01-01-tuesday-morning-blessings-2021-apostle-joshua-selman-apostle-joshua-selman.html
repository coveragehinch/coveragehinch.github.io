Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.<br /><br />Lamentations 3:22-23 KJV<br />It is of the Lord’s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.<br /><br />Matthew 6:34 KJV<br />Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.<br /><br />Isaiah 40:31 KJV<br />But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.<br /><br />Apostle Joshua Selman Sermon Powerful teaching 2021<br />Apostle Joshua Selman Sermon 2021<br />Apostle Joshua Selman messages 2021<br />Powerful prayers of Apostle Joshua Selman<br />Koinonia Live<br />Koinonia Abuja Sunday Service<br />SUBSCRIBE TO KELFUSION TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KelFusionTV">https://www.youtube.com/c/KelFusionTV</a><br />Please, help us spread the word further by sharing these videos on your social network: Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, WhatsApp, TikTok etc...<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />►Video original and produced exclusively by Kelfusion tv<br />►Video footage licence: Pixabay | Pexel <br />►Software: Adobe After Effect | Adobe Premiere Pro<br />►Speaker: Apostle Joshua Selman<br /><br />MORE VIDEOS FOR YOUR EDIFICATION:<br />Morning Blessings Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwKl8w5JLlsD8Y4ebD7qYLsscR3BagQb5">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwKl8w5JLlsD8Y4ebD7qYLsscR3BagQb5</a><br />Midnight Blessings Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwKl8w5JLlsB9xMG1zMWIkh2R-M5k_DBC">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwKl8w5JLlsB9xMG1zMWIkh2R-M5k_DBC</a><br />The Secret Place Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwKl8w5JLlsDCn3s2v7qMefFmiNsLKu34">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwKl8w5JLlsDCn3s2v7qMefFmiNsLKu34</a><br />Spiritual Warfare Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwKl8w5JLlsBh3gaSx-AUvWiGPVRafy-L">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwKl8w5JLlsBh3gaSx-AUvWiGPVRafy-L</a><br />Shorts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwKl8w5JLlsDNG6Lerr5jbcOAyCOpNql6">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwKl8w5JLlsDNG6Lerr5jbcOAyCOpNql6</a><br /><br />#PowerfulMessage #ApostleJoshuaSelmanMessage #OnlineSermon<br /><br />ABOUT Eternity Network International (ENI): <br />ENI is an apostolic ministry committed to replicating the fullness of God’s life on earth.
