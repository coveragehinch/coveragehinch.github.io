But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions<br /><br />You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening<br /><br />That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is<br />.........<br /><br /> #JustinBieber #Purpose  #yummy #lyrics<br /><br />.........<br />Justin Bieber - Purpose (Lyrics){% endraw %}
