{% raw %}hi!â™¥<br />I hope you are doing well. â™¥ the end of another semester is near for me, and with that comes an immense amount of stress, finishing exams, assignments etc. So these are my go to songs I listen to when I need to unwind in the evening. But to be completely honest, I use them to study as well, which defeats the purpose of this playlist but hey, at least I am calm while going through the study material. idk there is something about these songs that can keep me focused for a long time.  <br /><br />So, I hope that this playlist will be useful for you, for whatever you need to do, relax, study, write, draw... And good luck my friend, you've got this! â™¥ Also just a little reminder (with the exam season beginning), grades don't define your worth or how smart you are. As long as you're trying to do your best, be proud. You are a wonderful human being, who is trying to survive in this harsh world and you're doing great!â™¥<br /><br />I wish you the best of luck with whatever you've got going on. â™¥<br />Hope you have a wonderful day/night<br />Take care, <br />with love<br />N.â™¥<br /><br /><br />Notes:<br /> â™¡ Spotify link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0q1gpvqB2NzTson4nGA2OU?si=50f4b01e70984e2d">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0q1gpvqB2NzTson4nGA2OU?si=50f4b01e70984e2d</a><br /><br />â™¡ my ko-fi page (if you want you can tip me some money): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/sunsetdreams">https://ko-fi.com/sunsetdreams</a><br /><br />â™¡ I made a digital academic planner which you can download for free here if you want: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eIYJ9y9BtcVOOIqFRTYttDYfLNpHKQot/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eIYJ9y9BtcVOOIqFRTYttDYfLNpHKQot/view</a><br /><br /><br />â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡<br />If you see ads on my videos I am sorry, I sadly can't do anything about it.

It is safe and it can also loop videos. â™¥<br /><br />If you know some other ways of watching without ads, please let me know! <br />â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡<br /><br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: <br />None of these songs used to make this are mine.
