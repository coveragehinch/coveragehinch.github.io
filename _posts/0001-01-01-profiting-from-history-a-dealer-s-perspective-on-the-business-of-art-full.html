{% raw %}Full title: Profiting from History: A Dealer's Perspective on the Business of Art and its Contribution to Art History<br /><br />Date: 27 January 2015Time: 5:15 PM <br />Finishes: 27 January 2015Time: 7:00 PM <br />Venue: Brunei GalleryRoom: B102<br />Type of Event: Seminar<br />Series: CSEAS Seminar Programme <br /><br />Dealing in antiques sometimes gets bad press. But dealers can and do play a hugely useful role in the understanding and preservation of art and art history, as do major collectors. This role complements that played by art historians and curators, and academics in related fields. More widely, commercial motives are essential to a full understanding of art and art history but the role played by such motives often is under-emphasised.{% endraw %}
