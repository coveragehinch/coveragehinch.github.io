{% raw %}JLG is the world’s leading designer and manufacturer of access equipment. We deliver powerful, versatile equipment, along with unsurpassed training, service, and technologies. As the access industry leader, we feel it is our responsibility to innovate to advance the job site of tomorrow, today. Our approach to innovation is customer-inspired, enabling us to bring to market valuable solutions that provide tangible performance, productivity, and uptime benefits to our customers. The JLG Connected Solutions and Technical Publications team, identified augmented reality, a quickly emerging technology, as one that could help eliminate multiple customer pain points in the access industry. There were two main challenges JLG set out to solve with the use of augmented reality. The first was the need for customers, primarily heavy equipment contractors who rent aerial lifts, to know what machine/s or accessories were needed for specific jobs. JLG currently offers a product portfolio of 150+ products with many configurations. While rental companies are oftentimes familiar with the full depth of offerings, those that rent from these companies are not. The second challenge was to find a solution for transitioning from traditional paper manuals to something more user-friendly and easier to access on the go. In the fall of 2018, JLG engaged with AR/VR software development company, Futurus, to bring their vision for a more connected future to life. Ultimately, the solution would provide far more than the initial two challenges it set out to solve. The award-winning app is designed to provide efficient on-site management tools for JLG machine operators and technicians. The app includes Machine Visualization, Accessory Visualization, Decal Viewer, Operation Guidance, and Machine Inspection Assistance modules. These tools provide JLG customers easy access to view machine and accessory options, perform inspections, and understand machine decals and controls, all while using augmented reality technology via a downloadable app. This session will leave attendees with the following takeaways: • How to gain visibility while championing immersive technology within a large organization. • Considerations for prototyping and production before you start your own project. • Options for leveraging various types of immersive content in one cohesive experience.{% endraw %}
