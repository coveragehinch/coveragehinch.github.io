We join Rich as he heads out to bring the coneys to book, by day and by night.<br />Also in this week’s show, Mat Manning takes a look at the Hawke Frontier SF Mil Pro 3-15x44 scope. This remarkable riflescope promises high-end performance and features at a sensible price, and looks set to be a winner with serious airgun shooters.<br />-- Get more airgun insight every month in our sister magazine Airgun Shooter, available in all good newsagents and from www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/field-sports --{% endraw %}
