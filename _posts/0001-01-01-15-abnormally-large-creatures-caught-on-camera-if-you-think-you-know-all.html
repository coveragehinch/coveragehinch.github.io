{% raw %}If you think you know all there is to know about the world we live in, you’re in for a rude awakening. The truth is that there are over a million different kinds of animals on our planet - and as humans, we haven’t even begun to discover more than half of them. Every now and then, scientists come across some unbelievable animals and if you’re a fan of small, tame creatures that you can make pets out of, this video is not for you. But, if you’re a little more hardcore, we’re taking a look at 15 abnormally large creatures caught on camera to show you just how crazy nature really is. <br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br /><br />Watch our “25 Times Animals Chased Down Bikers!”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/AYs39LWf0Rw">https://youtu.be/AYs39LWf0Rw</a><br />Watch our “15 Largest Reptiles Caught On Camera”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rpGel0UKRyU">https://youtu.be/rpGel0UKRyU</a><br />Watch our “15 Most Beautiful Bird Species You've never Seen”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/BkF-2eC7bdA">https://youtu.be/BkF-2eC7bdA</a><br /><br />Big Jake - World's Tallest Horse <br /><br />Horses are pretty humongous as it is, but Big Jake is a horse unlike any other. When Big Jake was born, he was about 240 pounds which isn’t that unusual for a horse. However, he just kept growing. And growing... And growing. Big Jake reached a height of 6 feet, 10 inches, and weighed nearly 2500 pounds as an adult - which is about 2 times the size of an average horse. <br /><br />Big Jake broke the Guinness World Record for the tallest horse to ever live in 2010 and held the title ever since. Big Jake passed away in June 2021 at the age of 20 with no horse coming close to his size to this date. <br /><br />Chinese Giant Salamander <br /><br />Salamanders are pretty tiny animals - only going up to 6 inches at the most. However, the Chinese Giant Salamander is a fascinating cross between a lizard and a frog going up to - not six inches, but six feet in terms of their length. <br /><br />These reptilian creatures are roughly the size of a dog with their huge tails making up for most of their bodies. There are about 50,000 Chinese Giant Salamanders left in the whole world, meaning that these animals are officially a critically endangered species. <br /><br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at: factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
