{% raw %}SUBSCRIBE to Truly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj">http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj</a><br /><br />CAMILLE, from Connecticut, lives with a rare genetic condition called Prader-Willi Syndrome, a condition best known for creating an insatiable sense of hunger in the individual. The craving is so strong that if left alone and with access to food, a person with Prader-Willi Syndrome could eat themselves to death. That means Larry and Camille’s mother Kim must create a completely ‘food secure’ environment, including padlocking kitchen cabinets and having an alarm on the kitchen door to stop Camille foraging for snacks. Camille’s sneakiness around food has earned her the nickname the ‘stealth ninja’, but despite her ever-present hunger, people with Prader-Willi have low muscle tone and burn calories slowly, meaning she is required to subsist on a diet of 1,000-1,200 calories a day. Larry said: “Prader-Willi syndrome is what Camille lives with, it’s the diagnosis she’s been given, but it certainly does not define her. She is so much more, she’s loving, caring, kind, compassionate, giving, if you have some sort of animal she’ll never forget the story you tell about them or the animal’s name.”<br /><br />Videographer: Rajah Samaroo <br />Producers: Tom Midlane &amp; Natalia Giorgi<br />Editor: Omar Gobere<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
