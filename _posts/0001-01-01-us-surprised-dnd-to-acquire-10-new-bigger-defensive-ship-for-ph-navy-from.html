{% raw %}US Surprised: DND to acquire 10 New Bigger Defensive Ship for PH Navy from South Korean Shipbuilder<br /><br />South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries indicated their interest in bidding for 2 Landing Platforms Dock for the Philippine Navy under its ongoing Landing Docks Acquisition Project.<br /><br />We're still confirming if HHi did submit a bid last week.<br /><br />Based on HHI's naval products portfolio (refer to 1st photo), it has the HDL-7000 (aka ROKN Cheonwangbong-class LST, 3rd photo), and the larger HDL-13000 LPD (2nd photo) both of which can be modified to meet the PN's technical requirements.<br /><br />While the HDL-7000 is classified as an LST, it is actually closer to an LPD, having a well deck (4th photo) and helicopter landing deck and no front hull opening. Modifications on the design with a larger superstructure and changes in deck layout will allow it to be classified as an LPD.{% endraw %}
