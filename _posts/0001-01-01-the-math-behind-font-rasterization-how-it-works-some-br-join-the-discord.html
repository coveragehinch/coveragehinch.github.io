In this video I go into depth about the necessity for font rasterization, the math behind it, and how we convert the math to pixels on the screen. I also go over how 1st and 2nd order Bezier curves work. I talk about how to gain an intuition for Bezier curves, and how to formulize that intuition into Mathematical formulae. I also go over how to test if a point will intersect with a 2nd order Bezier curve. This is my entry into 3Blue1Brown's SoME competition and I hope you enjoy it!<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:38 A Brief History of Fonts<br />3:48 Using Math to Draw Letters<br />5:42 What are Bezier Curves?<br />9:09 How do Bezier Curves Really Work?<br />12:41 Testing Pixels<br />15:13 Edge Cases<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ambrosiogabe.github.io/">https://ambrosiogabe.github.io/</a><br />Github: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/ambrosiogabe">https://github.com/ambrosiogabe</a><br /><br />Here are some books I recommend if you want to learn about game engine development more thoroughly.
