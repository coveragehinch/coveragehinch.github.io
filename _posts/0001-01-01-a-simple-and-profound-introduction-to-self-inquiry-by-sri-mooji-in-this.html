{% raw %}In this Satsang, Sri Mooji re-introduces Self-Inquiry in a very profound but very clear and simple way for everyone. This Satsang is recommended for all to watch – new and 'old' to inquiry.<br /><br />&quot;We don’t need to know many things – we just become confused; you just need to know the right thing – the thing you need to know now. You don’t need 50 keys to open 1 lock. You need the RIGHT key. You can have a thousand keys, and you’ll just be a thousand times confused, more lost. You just need the right key. So today I’m hoping that we have found the right key to open the mystery into our own nature. When you say, “I am….”, which ‘I’ are you referring to? When you say, ‘I’, what does it mean? This is the birth of inquiry.&quot;<br /><br />Don’t be frightened by the inquiry; it is your friend. It is a tool in the pocket of your heart.<br /><br />Bhajan singer: Bholenath<br />Music into/outro: &quot;Until Only I Am&quot; by Shivali: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.satsangshop.com/music/581-kissed-from-within.html">http://www.satsangshop.com/music/581-kissed-from-within.html</a><br /><br />Monte Sahaja, Portugal{% endraw %}
