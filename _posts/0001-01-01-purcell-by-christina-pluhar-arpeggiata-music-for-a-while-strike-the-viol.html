At that time we deliberately refrained from altering the original harmonies of these ostinato basses (or 'grounds' as they were known in England). It was only the melodic idiom of the jazz clarinettist, with his subtle timing, that differed from 'our' seventeenth-century musical language.<br /><br />On Music for a while, however, we wished to underline the extraordinary modernity of Purcell's music by constantly moving between the centuries in the harmonies and styles of the improvisations. This change of musical style is often accomplished within a single bar of a piece by means of subtle rhythmic and harmonic modifications to the ground. The bass lines and melodies composed by Purcell remain intact, but the improvisatory style of the instruments suddenly switches centuries. Our listeners find themselves in a timeless music room.<br /><br />I am especially glad that the wonderful Gianluigi Trovesi has again enriched this new project with his superb artistry, ten years after All'lmprovviso. I am also delighted that I was able to persuade my old school friend, the extraordinary jazz guitarist Wolfgang Muthspiel from Graz, to join our Purcell project. »<br /><br />Henry Purcell PLAYLIST (reference recordings) : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3UZpQL9LIxNgRQk8s0xP0M3l2zHKcV1t">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3UZpQL9LIxNgRQk8s0xP0M3l2zHKcV1t</a>{% endraw %}
