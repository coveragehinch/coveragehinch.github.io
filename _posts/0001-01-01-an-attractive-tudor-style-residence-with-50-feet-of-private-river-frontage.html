{% raw %}Riversdale Lodge is an attractive Tudor style country residence, on a prestigious road, with 50 feet of private river frontage with expansive views over the beautiful Cookham Reach of the River Thames.<br /><br />The ground floor is well laid out around a substantial, central garden room. This room is a particular feature of the property with a vaulted, double height glazed roof, electric blinds and rain sensored automatic windows. This leads through to the immaculate leisure facilities which comprises indoor swimming pool, sauna, Jacuzzi, shower and WC. The drawing room is rear facing with an open fireplace and french doors to the garden. The kitchen/ breakfast room has a large amount of fitted units with granite work surfaces throughout, an electric hob and Bosch integrated appliances. Off the kitchen is the utility room, fitted with Miele dryer and washer. A double-aspect study, with fitted units has a large bay window. The spacious dining room has french doors to an enclosed fountain courtyard. <br /><br /><br />On the first floor the landing and corridor enjoy wonderful views of the garden and River Thames beyond. The addition of a new stunning glass walkway and oustanding Master bedroom suite is rear facing and enjoys fantastic views thanks to full height doors opening onto a balcony. The triple aspect suite comprises a double bedroom, large dressing room and en suite bathroom. Similar to the master bedroom, the guest bedroom suite is rear facing with en suite bathroom and dressing room. There are a further four bedrooms which share a well appointed family bathroom.<br /><br />Potential Alterations<br /><br />After taking council from highly respected architects and planning consultants, David Parker Architects of Watlington, there is ample to scope to enlarge Riversdale Lodge to bring it into the 21st Century.<br />Please see some example plans, without planning consent but we are told with a high probability of being passed, to include<br />i) The alteration of the existing layout to create a superb open plan Kitchen/Breakfast Family Room, to include the swimming pool or to replace the swimming pool<br />ii) The addition of a new walkway and outstanding Master Bedroom Suite with views of the River Thames<br />iii) The creation of a boathouse, on the river and ideal for entertaining<br />iv) The modification of the existing garage to add a further carport and separate annexe, ideal as a teenagers or au pairs suite.<br /><br />Such plans, if passed, would take the total square footage of Riversdale Lodge to towards 9000 square feet, and reinforces the property as a fantastic example to create a superb home offering an amazing lifestyle.<br /><br />Gardens and Grounds<br /><br />Riversdale Lodge is approached down a private road that is Riversdale, and accessed through electronically operated gates. There is ample parking for several vehicles, a detached double garage with electric door and storage over. The gardens are mature with formal lawns, pergolas and well stocked borders. The highlight is the river frontage, extending to 50 ft with a private mooring enjoying a west aspect across one of the widest stretches of the River Thames. A seating area and terrace create a perfect place to sit and take in the views out across the river towards National Trust land and the Winter Hill Golf Course beyond.<br /><br />Sales Guide Price - Â£3,500,000<br />hello@bovingdons.com I 01494677733{% endraw %}
