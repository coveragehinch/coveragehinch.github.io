{% raw %}BEST PREWEDDING VIDEO 2020 | HARDIK &amp; STUTI | SURYAGARH JAISALMER | SUNNY DHIMAN PHOTOGRAPHY | INDIA<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Contact for WEDDINGS / NEWBORN BABY / PRE WEDDINGS / FASHION / PORTFOLIOS / PRODUCTS / AND OTHER EVENTS !!! <br /><br />Sunny Dhiman Photography +91-9888859791 <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sunnydhiman.com">http://www.sunnydhiman.com</a> About Me I am a Chandigarh based fashion &amp; wedding photographer, born in Mandi Gobindgarh, Punjab. At the age of Eighteen, I decided to move to Chandigarh where I got into Commercial Photography and also earned a degree in Graphic Arts. By the time I was twenty-one, I moved to Mumbai and begun work with great photographers there for a year. I got my first break with Lakme India Fashion Week while living in Mumbai when I was just twenty-two at that time. I continued work in Femina and Gladrags. In 2006, I thought of returning back to Chandigarh and then I started my own business in Commercial and Fashion Photography for the local high profile clients those otherwise had to hire, photographers from other regions. During this period I also experienced the creative Wedding and Event Photography and immersed myself completely into them along with Fashion Photography. I like working with people, telling stories and creating a character in my images. While I am taking care of regional clients, I keep working on various National/International assignments while offering turnkey solutions to clients anywhere in the world. Having achieved so much in such less time, I still feel that my journey has just begun.<br /><br />#preweddingvideo #sunnydhiman #sunnydhimanphotography #suryagarhjaisalmer{% endraw %}
