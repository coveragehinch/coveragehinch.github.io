{% raw %}In this video, John Cruft, the Regional Professional Development Senior Manager for Macmillan Education, Asia and MENA, explores how we can develop a systematic approach to producing language (written and spoken).<br /><br />John discusses the importance of unit structure (macro) and end task (micro) and how through clear scaffolding learners can develop the skills required to complete productive tasks. Finally, John puts forward practical ideas for the classroom to get learners engaged with the tasks.{% endraw %}
