{% raw %}Today’s video is from my Miami interview with Coinbase, and it’s packed with so many gems. I get into the “eureka!” moment when I first realized NFTs were about to change everything, plus how big brands and small influencers can be smart with this “goldrush” moment. Finally, I talk about why this is the biggest consumer shift since Web 2.0.
