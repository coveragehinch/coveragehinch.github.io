{% raw %}In this video I look at why Excel sometimes selects multiple cells when you only click on one.  There are two modes in Excel that can cause this:<br /><br />1) Extend Selection mode (F8)<br />2) Add or Remove Selection mode (Shift F8)<br /><br />You can tell if Excel is in either of these modes by looking on your status bar.  Use the shortcuts shown above to toggle the modes on and off.{% endraw %}
