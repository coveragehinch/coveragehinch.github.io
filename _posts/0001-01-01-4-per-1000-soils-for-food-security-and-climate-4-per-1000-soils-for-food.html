{% raw %}4 per 1000 | Soils for food security and climate<br /><br />Human activities release enormous quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This intensifies the greenhouse effect and accelerates climate change. The world soil contains 2 to 3 times more carbon than the atmosphere. Increasing this storage of carbon by 4 parts for 1000 in the top 30 or 40cm of the soil could stop the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. This is the proposal of the &quot;4 parts for 1000, soils for food security and climate&quot;.<br /><br />Â© Cirad-Inra-IRD, 2015<br /><br />More info on www.cirad.fr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1FwqssM">http://bit.ly/1FwqssM</a><br /><br />The 4 per 1000 website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://4p1000.org/">http://4p1000.org/</a>{% endraw %}
