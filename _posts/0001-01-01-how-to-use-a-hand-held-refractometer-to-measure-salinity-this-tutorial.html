{% raw %}This tutorial, as part of my student training in basic seawater carbonate chemistry tutorial series, is a learning tool for students wanting to learn how to use new equipment. This video covers the use of a hand held refractometer which can be used to measure salinity in liquids such as seawater. Calibration and basic information on care are also covered.{% endraw %}
