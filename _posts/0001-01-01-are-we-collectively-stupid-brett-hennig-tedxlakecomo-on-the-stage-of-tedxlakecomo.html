{% raw %}On the stage of TEDxLakeComo, Brett made a compelling case that by randomly selecting their representatives humans can find smarter collective solutions for the problems in their community. We will only achieve true progress in collective decision making when we manage to root our decisions on empathy and understanding of other peopleâ€™s problems through an informed dialogue, in search of a truly common good.<br /><br />Brett is co-founder and director of the Sortition Foundation, a body that promotes the adoption of random and layered selection in the choice of governments. He holds a doctorate in astrophysics, and he wore a wide variety of hats: He was a taxi driver, software engineer, social justice activist, math tutor. After spending years defining discouragement in civil society and political organizations, inspired by the trilogy of political philosophy of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, he began to look for forms of network democracy. His book, &quot;The End of Politicians: Time for a Real Democracy,&quot; is &quot;a book for visionaries&quot; and &quot;a powerful criticism and a provocative alternative.&quot;<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
