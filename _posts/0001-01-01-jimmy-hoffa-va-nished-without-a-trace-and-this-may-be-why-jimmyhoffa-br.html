{% raw %}#JimmyHoffa<br />It’s July 30, 1975, and Jimmy Hoffa has gone to the Machus Red Fox Restaurant not far from  Detroit. Resigned, Hoffa phones his spouse and tells her that he’ll be home in a couple of hours. But that’s not going to happen. <br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br />In this video, images are used that do not belong to me.
