I have to admit, I going to multiple back to back restaurants to eat German food is a challenge - German food is so hearty and so filling. By the end of this food tour in Munich, I was ready to sleep immediately!<br /><br />Here are all the details about the restaurants and prices of the dishes I ate:<br /><br />1. Andy's Krablergarten<br />Andy's Krablergarten is known for their schnitzel, and they serve it up in a huge way. The cutlets are made from pork, and they are big and fried fresh. I tried a Hamburg schnitzel with eggs and a Munich style schnitzel with horseradish in the breading. It was fantastic. <br />Address: Thalkirchner Str. 2, 80337 München, Germany<br />Price: 10.90 EUR per schnitzel<br /><br />2. Andechser am Dom<br />This is a nice German food restaurant, located on the side of Munich Frauenkirche, a  major landmark in the heart of Munich. They serve a variety of traditional German Bavarian cuisine. My favorite dish was the mixed sausage plate, but the leberkäse was also good.<br />Address: Weinstraße 7A, 80333 München, Germany<br />Total price: 36.30 EUR<br /><br />3. Ice cream at Schuhbeck's Eissalon<br />Address: Pfisterstraße 11, 80331 München, Germany<br /><br />4. Bergwolf<br />Bergwolf is a German fast food restaurant in Munich, and their speciality is currywurst, a plate of sausage topped in sauce and fries. It’s not the healthiest of all German dishes, but it sure tastes pretty amazing - one of those 3 am kind of dishes.<br />Address: Fraunhoferstraße 17, 80469 München, Germany<br />Price: 5.40 EUR<br /><br />5. Augustiner Bräustuben<br />Augustiner Bräustuben is a classic German brewery and restaurant in Munich, Germany. You’ll find some very classic Bavarian dishes on their menu and a good selection of beer.<br />Address: Landsberger Str. 19, 80339 München, Germany<br />Total price: 24.25 EUR<br /><br />Thank you for watching this German food tour of Munich. I hope it will provide you with some tips on where to eat amazing German food when you’re in Munich!<br /><br />-<br /><br />Music in this video: Roadtrip Through Europe, Volksmusiker - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/HwVjdo">https://goo.gl/HwVjdo</a><br /><br />MY CAMERA GEAR:<br />Main camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2dEL3hv">http://amzn.to/2dEL3hv</a><br />Main lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2e5Lum6">http://amzn.to/2e5Lum6</a><br />2nd camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2mczuDx">http://amzn.to/2mczuDx</a><br />2nd lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2mcEGau">http://amzn.to/2mcEGau</a><br />Microphone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2dEr9Z9">http://amzn.to/2dEr9Z9</a><br />Gorillapod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2epFsQx">http://amzn.to/2epFsQx</a><br />*These are Amazon affiliate links<br /><br />I would love to connect with you!<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/migrationology">https://instagram.com/migrationology</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/migrationology">https://www.facebook.com/migrationology</a><br /><br />T-shirts available now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://migrationology.com/store/">https://migrationology.com/store/</a>{% endraw %}
