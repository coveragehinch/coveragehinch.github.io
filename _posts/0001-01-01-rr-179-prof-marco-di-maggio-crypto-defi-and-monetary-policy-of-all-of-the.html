{% raw %}Of all of the possible disruptive uses of cryptocurrency and blockchain, decentralized finance (or DeFi) might be the one most likely to bring this technology to a wider audience; and challenge the established finance industry in the process. For this week’s episode on crypto-based decentralized finance, we welcome economist and faculty member in the Finance Unit at Harvard Business School, Professor Marco Di Maggio. Tuning in, you’ll learn everything you need to know about DeFi and cryptocurrency, from the most basic definitions to the potential macroeconomic and geopolitical implications of a decentralized reserve currency and the effects  of decentralization on monetary policy transmission. Tuning in, you’ll learn the definitions for DAOs, DEX, NFTs and more, and Marco elaborates on some of the reasons that decentralization is seen as an improvement over central systems as well as some of the issues that it represents. Make sure not to miss this enlightening conversation with Professor Marco Di Maggio as he shares his powerful contrasting perspectives on this inherently libertarian technology.<br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 Intro <br />3:07 What is Crypto/DAO/Stablecoin/Dex?<br />14:22 Is DeFi a technology revolution? <br />33:05 What is the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum?<br />40:33 Regulation and Crypto<br />54:50 What is an NFT?<br />58:35 How do you define success in your life?<br /><br />Links From Today’s Episode:<br />Rational Reminder on iTunes — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-rational-reminder-podcast/id1426530582.">https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-rational-reminder-podcast/id1426530582.</a> <br />Rational Reminder Website — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rationalreminder.ca/">https://rationalreminder.ca/</a> <br />Shop Merch — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.rationalreminder.ca/">https://shop.rationalreminder.ca/</a><br />Join the Community — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://community.rationalreminder.ca/">https://community.rationalreminder.ca/</a><br />Follow us on Twitter — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RationalRemind">https://twitter.com/RationalRemind</a><br />Follow us on Instagram — @rationalreminder<br />Benjamin on Twitter — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/benjaminwfelix">https://twitter.com/benjaminwfelix</a><br />Cameron on Twitter — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CameronPassmore">https://twitter.com/CameronPassmore</a><br />Prof. Marco Di Maggio on Twitter — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/profdimaggio">https://twitter.com/profdimaggio</a><br />Prof. Marco Di Maggio — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=697248">https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=697248</a>{% endraw %}
