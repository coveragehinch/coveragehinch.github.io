{% raw %}Out of the many film simulations fujifilm offers, I've narrowed down my usage to just a few.  Today, I'd like to share with you all the ones I use the most (and in each scenario I'd use them).  Hopefully this can give a better understanding on the qualities of each film simulation and why I like them.  If you are starting to shoot fujifilm, I'd greatly recommend experimenting with each of these!
