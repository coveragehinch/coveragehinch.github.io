The Kettle's On: A book of steadfast comfort, always there for you, makes any day better, like a cup of tea (or your favorite warm drink). <br />2. Grandmother's Quilt: A book that reminds you of a loved one, or a comforting book that was given to you or read aloud to you by someone dear. <br />3. Warm Spices: A book with particularly vivid prose or imagery. A story comforting in its richness, depth, or vibrance. <br />4. Candlelight: A book that keeps you going or encourages you when things feel dark. <br />5. Laugh-Medicine: A book that makes you laugh out loud or grin widely, coming to the rescue on the gloomiest days. <br />6. In Bed All Day: You've got your warm drink, a cozy blanket (maybe grandmother's quilt.) What do you read when you're curled up in bed all day? (Or for a couple of hours, anyway.)<br />7. Endless Comfort: A book that brings you solace no matter how many times you reread it. <br />8. Portable Hope: A book that restores your faith in humanity, faith in life, faith in yourself. A book that says, &quot;It's going to be okay. The world is full of good things, and tomorrow will be better.&quot;<br />9. A Basket for Your Neighbor: Just as it's lovely to be comforted by books, it can be lovely to pass the comfort along. Imagining you were putting together a cozy comfort basket for your neighbor (or friend, loved one, take your pick), which book(s) would you include?<br />10. A Walk in the Woods: Though we'd like to stay curled up indoors with our books forever (or, at least, I would), we've got to venture into the world again sometime. A walk in the woods always helps me feel refreshed (unless I happen upon a spider or something, but let's not think about that). Tell us about a book with beautiful nature writing, or a book that restores your peace. <br /><br />What I use to record my videos:<br />üé• Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3o3CvWG">https://amzn.to/3o3CvWG</a><br />üé§ Microphone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3n4W9Ah">https://amzn.to/3n4W9Ah</a><br /><br />(All above product links may be affiliate links.
