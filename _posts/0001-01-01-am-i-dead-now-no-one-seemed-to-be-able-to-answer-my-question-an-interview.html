{% raw %}Manuela Fazzi, a therapeutic Yoga instructor and Ayurveda therapist in Switzerland, had an NDE following a routine surgery that went horribly wrong.<br /><br />Contents:<br />00:40 Please share with our audience what happened during a horribly failed routine surgery.<br />04:13 So the catastrophe didn’t happen during your surgery, but afterwards?<br />08:37 What thoughts for instance did you perceive?<br />09:12 How did you perceive this view on yourself? <br />15:39 So you had the capability of knowing that particular person’s biography with whom you were emotionally connected with?<br />19:10 Was it indeed a chronological sequence of events all the way back to your birth?<br />20:21 How did your near-death experience come to an end?<br />21:25 Did you immediately become aware of your near-death experience upon waking up? <br />22:16 Did you get to talk about any of it with someone?<br />26:06 How did your physical recovery proceed after the surgery? <br />34:01 How did things evolve for you on your Yoga path after all doors had opened to you again?<br />39:22 What ideas do you deem most relevant with regard to healing?<br />41:22 In your opinion, what are the most significant and sustained results in spiritual transformation caused by your near-death experience?<br />41:47 One of your quotes reads: “I sense a strong wish to alleviate human suffering.” Is this another outcome of your near-death experience?<br />42:49 What does your typical day of providing therapy look like today? What kind of people seek your help?<br />43:50 Is the capability and sensitivity of feeling another person another result of your near-death experience?<br />44:50 Can you accurately tell whether those feelings that you’re picking up come from the other person or maybe emanate from within yourself?<br />45:38 In retrospect, do you regard this long path as a consecutive sequence of individual steps with one leading to the next? Do you feel that you were guided?<br />47:12 Do you think that an existence of the soul prior to physical birth is possible and that the soul bonds with a physical body not only once? Do you think reincarnation exists?<br />48:07 In summing it all up: Life and the great experience of human existence is about evolving consciousness and death is simply another transition, at the very least nothing to be afraid of?<br /><br />Credits:<br />Director: Heike Sucky<br />Translation: Werner Nieke<br />Voice-over: Kate Howlett-Jones, Peter Cox<br />Editor, Interviewer: Werner Huemer<br /><br />℗ Mediaservice Werner Huemer<br />© 2021 Thanatos TV EN<br /><br /><br />PLEASE SUPPORT OUR WORK WITH YOUR DONATION:<br /><br />Thanatos<br />IBAN: AT13 1400 0862 1017 7770<br />BIC: BAWAATWW<br /><br />Paypal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=CNDY6LJZFU3GN">https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=CNDY6LJZFU3GN</a>{% endraw %}
