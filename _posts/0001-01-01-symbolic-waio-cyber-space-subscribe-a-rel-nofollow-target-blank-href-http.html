As a veteran DJ that has been moving effortlessly along the Psytrance spectrum he easily morphs into the Future Music sound with this release, and has selected a fresh tracklist of 11 blasting, full power psytrance tunes. Ranging between 142 to 146 bpm, the album offers unwavering basslines and a visceral psychedelic experience across a defined trajectory of sound dimensions. With a steady curatorial hand and clear psychedelic focus, Ace Ventura honors the time-bending experience that psytrance is all about.<br /><br />Parallel Universes<br />================<br />Progressive Universe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/ProgUniverseSubscribe">http://bit.ly/ProgUniverseSubscribe</a><br />Soundtracked Universe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SoundtrackedUniverseSub">http://bit.ly/SoundtrackedUniverseSub</a><br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SoundCloudPsychedelicUniverse">http://bit.ly/SoundCloudPsychedelicUniverse</a><br /><br />üòéPsychedelic fashion, art, jewelry &amp; accessories: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://trancentralshop.com/">https://trancentralshop.com/</a><br /><br />Follow Trancentral <br />===============<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://trancentral.tv">http://trancentral.tv</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/TrancentralSubscribe">http://bit.ly/TrancentralSubscribe</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/TrancentralSpotify">http://bit.ly/TrancentralSpotify</a><br />Chill Space Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ChillSpaceSpotify">https://bit.ly/ChillSpaceSpotify</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TrancentralTV">https://www.facebook.com/TrancentralTV</a><br /><br />This Channel is a part of the Glide Bros.
