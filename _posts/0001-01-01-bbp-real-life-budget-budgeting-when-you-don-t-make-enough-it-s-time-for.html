{% raw %}It's time for another Real Life Budget. We asked my readers to submit their REAL information. Real spending, real debt, and real savings goals.<br /><br />I am taking those real-life numbers and showing you how I would organize and budget that information using my Budget By Paycheck¬Æ Method.<br /><br />In this video, I will be showing the real numbers from a reader, Jillian. Jillian and her husband live in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Currently, she and her husband do not bring in enough money to cover their expenses. <br /><br />CHAPTERS:<br />00:00 Introduction<br />00:41 About Jillian<br />02:40 Jillian's Why<br />03:50 Jillian's Income<br />04:29 Jillian's Bills<br />06:00 Jillian's Variable Expenses<br />06:29 Jillian's Debt<br />08:50 Income - Expenses<br />09:46 Bare Bones Budget<br />15:14 My Recommendations <br /><br />‚û°Ô∏è HOW I TRACK MY SPENDING: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3aIe89I">https://bit.ly/3aIe89I</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è HOW TO USE A BUDGET CALENDAR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2IzF2Vj">https://bit.ly/2IzF2Vj</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è FINDING YOUR WHY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3aJUryj">https://bit.ly/3aJUryj</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è THE BUDGET MOM'S FINANCIAL FREEDOM STEPS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3cfJXsp">https://bit.ly/3cfJXsp</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è HOW TO GET STARTED WITH THE CASH ENVELOPE METHOD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2vQJaO5">https://bit.ly/2vQJaO5</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è HOW TO CREATE A PLAN OF ATTACK TO PAY OFF DEBT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2wDETxF">https://bit.ly/2wDETxF</a><br /><br />ABOUT ME<br /><br />I'm the blogger behind <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebudgetmom.com.">https://www.thebudgetmom.com.</a> I have a rambunctious 6-year-old son, live in Washington, and I'm passionate about helping people with money management and personal finance.
