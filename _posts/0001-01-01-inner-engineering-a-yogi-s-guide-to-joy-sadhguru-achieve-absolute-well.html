{% raw %}Achieve absolute well-being with the classical science of yoga<br /><br />The practice of what is commonly known as hatha yoga is but one of eight branches of the body of knowledge that is yoga. Yoga is a sophisticated system of self-empowerment that is capable of harnessing and activating inner energies in such a way that your body and mind function at their optimal capacity. It is a means to create inner situations exactly the way you want them, turning you into the architect of your own joy. A yogi lives life in this expansive state, and in this transformative book Sadhguru tells the story of his own awakening from a boy with an unusual affinity for the natural world to a young daredevil who crossed the Indian continent on his motorcycle. He relates the moment of his enlightenment on a mountaintop in southern India, where time stood still and he emerged radically changed.<br /><br />Teachings and tools for a life of joy<br /><br />As Sadhguru explains, the term guru means, &quot;Dispeller of darkness, someone who opens the door for you. As a guru, I have no doctrine to teach, no philosophy to impart, no belief to propagate. And that is because the only solution for all the ills that plague humanity is self-transformation. Self-transformation means that nothing of the old remains. It is a dimensional shift in the way you perceive and experience life.&quot; The wisdom distilled in this accessible, profound, and engaging audiobook offers you time-tested tools that are fresh, alive, and radiantly new. Inner Engineering presents a revolutionary way of thinking about our humanity and the opportunity to achieve nothing less than a life of joy.<br /><br />This Channel does not own the rights to these audio, images, or video clips.
