The logic on offer is that these words were inserted by 'force' in the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution and are not constant with Indian thought and culture. <br /><br />But even if that logic is accepted for arguments sake - will removing these two words alter our Constitution???? Is secularism and socialism limited to the Preamble or runs much much deeper in our Constitution. If that is the case - why is this game being played to remove these two words???The Deshbhakt takes a look at the games being played in #NewIndia. <br /><br />*** Subscribe to #TheDeshBhakt to unlock Discord / Exclusive Chats / Content ***<br /><br />PATREON MEMBERSHIP - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thedeshbhakt">https://www.patreon.com/thedeshbhakt</a> (International Credit Card / Debit Card)<br /><br />JOIN MEMBERSHIP ON YOUTUBE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/thedeshbhakt/JOIN">https://www.youtube.com/thedeshbhakt/JOIN</a><br /><br />INSTAMOJO - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://imjo.in/XU5arJ">https://imjo.in/XU5arJ</a> (Phone Pe / G Pay / PayTM / BHIM / CC / DC / Netbanking)<br /><br />PAYPAL - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/thedeshbhakt">https://www.paypal.me/thedeshbhakt</a><br /><br />****** Get the New DeshBhakt Merch! *******<br /><br />India Shipping Only - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kadakmerch.com/thedeshbhakt">https://kadakmerch.com/thedeshbhakt</a><br /><br />*********Follow us on ************<br /><br />YouTube: - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/thedeshbhakt">https://youtube.com/thedeshbhakt</a><br />Twitter :- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/thedeshbhakt">https://twitter.com/thedeshbhakt</a><br />Instagram :- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/akashbanerjee.in">https://instagram.com/akashbanerjee.in</a><br />Facebook :- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/akashbanerjee.in">https://www.facebook.com/akashbanerjee.in</a><br />Podcasts - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anchor.fm/thedeshbhakt">https://anchor.fm/thedeshbhakt</a><br /><br />********** More DeshBhakt Videos:************<br /><br />The Deshbhakt Episodes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3eLgvLv">https://bit.ly/3eLgvLv</a><br /><br />EMERGENCY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3dM4Bj8">https://bit.ly/3dM4Bj8</a><br /><br />Bhakt Banerjee Rocks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2VuFQlf">https://bit.ly/2VuFQlf</a><br /><br />B&amp;D Media and the Public: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/389jjzw">https://bit.ly/389jjzw</a><br /><br />India explained with TheDeshbhakt: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2ZjNVKD">https://bit.ly/2ZjNVKD</a><br /><br />Akash-Vaani: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3eKvN3h">https://bit.ly/3eKvN3h</a>{% endraw %}
