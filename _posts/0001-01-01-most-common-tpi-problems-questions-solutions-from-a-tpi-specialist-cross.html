Do TPI bikes foul plugs? Sensor problems? The TPI air screw mod?  How does TPI KTM or Husqvarna compare to the carb models? The TPI bikes typically have a softer bottom end power delivery, but similar top end.  The main reason is a softer ignition curve, but the location of the injectors also contributed due to a reduced opportunity for fuel/air to mix properly at low revs. So this is a TPI review. Some models have spluttered at low revs. But the carb models can have problems too. Since 2017 the jetting has caused spluttery power and poor fuel economy. We will talk about TPI sensor problems soon. The finicky Mikuni carb is extremely difficult to get running consistently. Both carby and TPI bikes respond very well to basic mods. And once set up correctly both have very similar power delivery. Do TPI bikes need rebuilds more often? We suggest top end rebuilds every 80 to 100 hours maximum for a 250 or 300. The TPIs are especially sensitive to top end wear as blow-by past the rings will begin to alter the crank pressure readings sent to the ECU. How reliable is a TPI bike? Generally they are reliable but there have been issues with some of the 17 ECU maps released by the factory. Some caused problems, others have been much better. We find the TPIs are reliable once a few basic mods are done. The most important mods?  Incorrect TPI air screw setting. This is used to adjust the idle speed, but it has effects on midrange revs too. Remove the stock grub screw and fit a longer bolt that can be adjusted by hand while the engine is running. Incorrect settings result in a weak or hanging idle, spluttery power delivery, and poor throttle response. Use the latest extreme mapping from the factory, which uses more oil. And fit an idle bolt, which allows separate tuning of the air and idle settings on the throttle body. Lets look at specific issues. Has a lack of oil caused problems? On some TPI models, yes. Fouling spark plugs. A lack of oil can cause significant wear up the back wall of the cylinder, usually centered over the rear boost port. You can check by removing your exhaust and looking at the back wall of the cylinder for vertical black or grey marks. The 2018 and 2019 models used a reasonable amount of oil, although some used less than others. The oil tank did not have a screen in it so it was important to clean the tank and test the output of the oil pump. 2020 models had a screen fitted to the tank but unfortunately the mapping used less oil, causing a high number of failures on low hour bikes. The factory has now released new extreme maps. These bring the oil level back to roughly the same level as the 2019 bikes, Fouling plugs at startup. This emerged with 2020 and 2021 models. A simple solution was to pull out the cold start knob on the side of the throttle body when starting the bike cold, and let it idle for a few minutes before touching the throttle. A more permanent fix is to update the ECU with more appropriate fuel maps. The ECU reflash that we offer addresses this issue and virtually eliminates plug fouling. If you consistently foul plugs you can use the cheaper NGK BPR7ES or BPR8ES plugs. These still perform very well but at a fraction of the cost. Remember if your bike suddenly starts fouling plugs it might be a worn top end or a faulty crank pressure sensor. Spluttery power at lower revs. Some 2018 and 2019 KTM and Husqvarna TPI models had spluttering and unpredictable power delivery at part throttle and lower revs due to issues with the stock mapping. The only complete solution is to reflash the stock ECU with improved maps. But it pays to check other possible causes first: a faulty crankcase pressure sensor, an incorrect air screw setting, low fuel pressure, or a worn top end. Do I need to replace the oil pump regularly? Generally the oil pumps are very reliable unless they get dirt or grit inside them. As mentioned the 18 and 19 models had no oil screen and were susceptible. Faulty Crankcase Pressure Sensors (CCP).The ECU uses the data from these sensors to determine the fuel, ignition and oil needs of the engine. It is quite common for these to become faulty or blocked, causing spluttering and weak/unpredictable power delivery at part throttle and lower revs. But it will usually be fine at higher revs.  The easiest test is to swap the crankcase pressure sensor with the ambient pressure sensor as they are identical. If the bike suddenly runs better then the crankcase pressure sensor needs replacement or cleaning. Be careful with aftermarket sensors. They may appear identical to the factory ones but may give incorrect readings to the ECU. <br />#crosstrainingenduro #enduro #tractionerag #dirtbike{% endraw %}
