{% raw %}Supply chain issues are only worsening.<br />The government sabotaged the supply chain, and now they can't undo the damage they did. It's gonna be a rough winter for a lot of folks.Higher prices at the gas pump .Stores charging two times more for stuff<br /> U.S. ports currently jammed with ships waiting to be unloaded.<br /> As of late September, 2021 there is an average of 60 vessels – and as many as 73 – at anchor outside the Ports of L.A. and Long Beach, so the problem peaked this month.<br /> Ships not getting past the offloading bottleneck at the ports.<br /><br />This has to do with huge increase in demand, No workers on the docks and no Power in China.<br />There's a shortage of truckers at the ports for the goods to be taken off awaiting ships to come into port and offload.<br />There are no port workers thanks to cheap pay.<br /> More and more parked ships waiting offload.<br />There is a shortage of cranes to unload the ships.<br />CDL drivers to transport to distribution centers are lacking.<br />The ports are full of goods awaiting trucks to take the goods across America.<br />This is partly caused by a California Truck Ban which says all trucks must be 2011 or newer ,and a law called AB 5 which prohibits Owner Operators.<br />Traditionally the ports have been served by not unionized Owner Operators . California has now banned all Owner Operators.<br />Long term truckers in California are not investing in new trucks because California has a law that will outlaw it in 2035. They want them to purchase electric trucks which do not exist yet.<br />25% of truck drivers have QUIT driving because of the new $ 15 min wage they can make elsewhere.{% endraw %}
