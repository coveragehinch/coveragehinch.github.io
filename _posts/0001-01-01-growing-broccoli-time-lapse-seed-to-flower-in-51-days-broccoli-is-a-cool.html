{% raw %}Broccoli is a cool weather crop that's why it flowered before it had a chance to form a large head. The room that it was growing in is about 24°C (75°F) day and night. Would be better off growing it outdoors. but I'm happy with the results :)<br /><br />Music from Epidemic sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/3pS7H8">http://share.epidemicsound.com/3pS7H8</a><br />A Little More Conversation - Ofelia Moore<br /><br />Mars Hydro Grow Lights:<br />Link to Mars Hydro website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2RzOTPB">https://bit.ly/2RzOTPB</a><br />Discount code: box <br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiL9l2J57t5OG2aZ0huswZw?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiL9l2J57t5OG2aZ0huswZw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Socials<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/Boxlapsefilms/">https://www.instagram.com/Boxlapsefilms/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Boxlapse/">https://www.facebook.com/Boxlapse/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/boxlapse">https://twitter.com/boxlapse</a>{% endraw %}
