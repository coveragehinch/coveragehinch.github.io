{% raw %}Kai-Fu Lee is one of the world’s leading Artificial Intelligence experts and a bestselling author.  In conversation with Kamal Ahmed, former Editorial Director of the BBC, he discussed his new work of ‘scientific fiction’, AI 2041, co-authored with the celebrated novelist Chen Qiufan. He founded Microsoft Asia’s research lab that has trained CTOs and AI heads at Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba and Huawei. As President of Google China he helped establish the company in the Chinese market. And now, as CEO of Sinovation Ventures, he is investing in China’s high-tech sector, giving him a unique perspective on how AI is set to change our world over the next 20 years. <br />On September 22 Lee came to Intelligence Squared to explain how AI is at an inflection point  and urged us to wake up to its radiant possibilities as well as to the existential threats it poses to life as we know it. AI 2041 offers up eye-opening scenarios of our techno-future – from a teenage girl’s rebellion when AI gets in the way of romance to a rogue quantum computer scientist’s revenge plot that imperils the world. <br /><br />About Intelligence Squared: <br /><br />Intelligence Squared has established itself as the leading forum for live, agenda-setting debates, talks and discussions around the world.<br /><br />Our aim is to promote a global conversation that enables people to make informed decisions about the issues that matter, in the company of the world's greatest minds and orators.<br /><br />Click here to subscribe on Apple Podcasts and receive our audio podcasts as soon as they are released: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/3nKUHV4">https://apple.co/3nKUHV4</a><br /><br />Brilliant minds, debate, online events, ask your questions.
