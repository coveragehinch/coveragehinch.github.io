{% raw %}TRIGGER WARNING: This video heavily shows people exhibiting tics.<br /><br />Nightfam, no doubt, it's so BEAUTIFUL to see less-known conditions like tic disorders or Tourette's get the spotlight and welcoming community they deserve! We will always support empowering voices that need to be heard [Heart] But when I saw the news as reported by doctors, it also made me wonder if we should reevaluate the type of content we consume -- as well as the real-life impact they have on us. <br /><br />What do you think, guys? Would love to know your thoughts below! And, please, kindly finish the video before commenting.<br /><br />For business enquiries please email sonya@projectnightfall.org<br /><br />#ProjectNightfall #TikTok #TouretteSyndrome <br /><br />FOLLOW US ON OUR SOCIALS:<br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://projectnightfall.org/">https://projectnightfall.org/</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/projectnightfall/">https://www.instagram.com/projectnightfall/</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ProjectNightfall">https://www.facebook.com/ProjectNightfall</a><br /><br />Hiya!!!{% endraw %}
