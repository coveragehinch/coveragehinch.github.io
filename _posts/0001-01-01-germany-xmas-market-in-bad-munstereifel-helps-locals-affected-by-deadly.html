The states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) were worst hit by the heavy rainstorms which had caused rivers to burst their banks.<br /><br />SOUNDBITES:<br /><br />SOT, Fabio Lo Presti, City Lounge employee (German): &quot;We had a restaurant here in the city called City Lounge and unfortunately it was completely destroyed. I had to remove everything, the walls had to be knocked down, all cables, furniture, everything had to be thrown away. At the moment it's being dried out but the house is very old, we had a lot of wood in the house and we must wait until it is dry. And the Christmas market helps us a lot because we want to meet with people, work . And the Christmas market helps us with this, and we are really glad that we can do that here.&quot;<br /><br />SOT, Jana Obladen, Printenhaus cafe manager (German): &quot;We were badly affected by the flood, the cafe is totally destroyed and things aren't going so well for us. But we have the Christmas market here, we can work here, and we are allowed to go into the booths despite Corona, despite 2G regulations. We are really happy and can make a bit of revenue. And will see what comes of everything.&quot;<br /><br />SOT, Norbert Hollender, Ladylike fashion store manager (German): &quot;For many who live here and who survived the flood, this Christmas market is a ray of hope, a place where we can meet one another, to exchange, and where the bad things that you can see here in the city- the destroyed houses, the collapsed walls, can be pushed a little to one side. And you can laugh a little, see the beauty, you develop a feeling of happiness and a Christmas feeling, and it's important for all of us here that we experience this and don't always see the bad side of things. This is a path to the future and, simply, allows us to have a feeling of happiness.&quot;<br /><br />#BadMunstereifel #Germany<br /><br />    Video ID: 20211126-001<br /><br />    Video on Demand: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ruptly.tv/videos/20211126-001">https://ruptly.tv/videos/20211126-001</a><br />    Contact: cd@ruptly.tv    <br /><br />    Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/Ruptly">http://twitter.com/Ruptly</a><br />    Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/Ruptly">http://www.facebook.com/Ruptly</a>{% endraw %}
