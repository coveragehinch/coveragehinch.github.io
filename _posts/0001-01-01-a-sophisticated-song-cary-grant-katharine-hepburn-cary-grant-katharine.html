{% raw %}Cary Grant + Katharine Hepburn = Hijinks<br /><br /><br /><br />I grew up with these movies as a kid and it always struck me how the prototypically suave Cary Grant became such a mess around Katharine Hepburn (of course, he's nutty in other, non-Hepburn films, but that's not my point here).<br /><br /><br /><br />Sources include Bringing Up Baby, Holiday, and the Philadelphia Story. <br /><br /><br /><br />Song is by Hugh Laurie and the audio is directly from an episode of &quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot; (hence the laugh track).{% endraw %}
