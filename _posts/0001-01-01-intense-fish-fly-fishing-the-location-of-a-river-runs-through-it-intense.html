{% raw %}Intense Fish: Fly Fishing the location of A River Runs Through It <br /><br />Brown, Rainbow and Brook Trout all appear in this video taking place at one of the locations where A River Runs Through It (the most popular fly fishing movie in history) was filmed. While fishing the Gallatin River at the Base of Stormcastle Peak near Big Sky outside of Bozeman Montana, we catch multiple Brown Trout, Rainbow Trout and Brook Trout. <br /><br />With the helpful advice from our experienced anglers, watching this video will provide you with insight during your own fishing of the Upper and Lower Gallatin River, near Yellowstone National Park. In these waters you can potentially catch Brown Trout, Rainbow Trout, Cutthroat Trout, Brook Trout, Golden Trout, Whitefish and Arctic Grayling while fly fishing and using traditional tackle.<br /><br />Bonafide Fishing<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bonafidefishing.com">http://www.bonafidefishing.com</a><br /><br />Bonafide Film House Production<br />A Bozeman Based Video Production Company<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bonafidefilmhouse.com">http://www.bonafidefilmhouse.com</a><br /><br />Follow Bonafide Fishing on Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bonafidefishing/">https://www.facebook.com/bonafidefishing/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/bonafidefishing">https://twitter.com/bonafidefishing</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bonafidefishing.tumblr.com">http://bonafidefishing.tumblr.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bonafidefishing/">https://www.instagram.com/bonafidefishing/</a>{% endraw %}
