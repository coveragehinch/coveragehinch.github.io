The beauty of general practice is that every day is different. There's no way to predict what will come through the door any given moment. <br />Nurses working in practice nursing positions will often find one of their first tasks or responsibilities to be triaging or prioritising urgency of need of different patients who may be ringing the practice or presenting for help. <br /><br />Now, don't be intimidated by this. A lot of the work we do as nurses in terms of triage is really patient education or helping decide if something should come into the practice or if it is urgent enough that they might need an ambulance or to go directly to an emergency department. Most nurses will have the skills needed to have these conversations and if something needs the clinical opinion of a doctor then they're usually only in the next room. There are also triage training courses that can provide the foundation knowledge or serve as a refresher. <br /><br />In addition to triage, other common tasks practice nurses will be responsible for include:<br /><br />Helping with patient assessments, including updating the patient file, taking measurements and vital signs. <br />Sending Recalls and reminders for preventive activities or bringing patients back into the clinic for review or to discuss test results with the doctors. <br />helping with stock control and ordering supplies<br />assisting with Immunisations which are part of the national program or even travel vaccines in some clinics. <br />providing wound care services<br />assisting GPs with small procedures<br />helping coordinate patient referrals with other providers<br />providing patient education on a range of topics. <br />supporting patients with chronic disease management by helping create management plans and monitoring progress towards health goals. <br />help the practice with accreditation tasks<br />be involved in clinical discussions and contribute ideas and work towards improving the quality of practice services.{% endraw %}
