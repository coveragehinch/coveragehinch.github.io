Thus, this channel was created to provide help and support to those who want to know more about Canada or move to Canada as Permanent Residents.<br /><br />I am a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant, Registered with ICCRC to deliver Immigration related services to Individuals and Companies across the globe. I try my best to give as much information as possible and answer questions. <br /><br />#Canadapr #expressentry #canada #news #canadaimmigration #beingcanada #studyincanada #pr #sahilsayal<br /><br />Disclaimer: The RCIC, Sahil Sayal, creators, producers and directors of this video and channel express their views &amp; opinions based on generic information and not on personal information, cases or situations of any person.
