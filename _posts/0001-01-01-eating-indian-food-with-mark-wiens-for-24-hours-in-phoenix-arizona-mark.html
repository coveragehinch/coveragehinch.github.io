He and I have known each other for nearly a decade and planned an epic, 3-day food tour of the city. Come with us on our first adventure as I eat Indian food with Mark Wiens for 24 hours in Phoenix, Arizona!<br /><br />Mark lived in the Phoenix area a long time ago, so exploring with him would be a treat! Our first food adventure kicked off at The Dhaba Restaurant &amp; Market Place. It was very elegant and reminiscent of India!<br /><br />‚úàÔ∏è CHECK OUT MY TRAVEL BLOG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://davidsbeenhere.com/">https://davidsbeenhere.com/</a> <br />üëï DAVID‚ÄôS BEEN HERE MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/davids-been-here">https://teespring.com/stores/davids-been-here</a> <br /><br />After watching the cooks make garlic naan, biryani, seekh kebabs, butter chicken, malai kofta, and more, we started with pani puri at our table. The crunch, masala, and herbs were perfect, and it was more savory than sweet. <br /><br />We also had dahi puri, which is a version with yogurt instead of pani. Adding some pani made it sweet and spicy! Next were chicken seekh kebabs, served sizzler-style, with garlic naan. I loved the caramelized onions!<br /><br />The butter chicken had a thick, creamy gravy, and the chicken kadai was rich and buttery, with huge chunks of chicken. Both of them with the naan are matches made in heaven! The malai kofta was crumbly and nutty, with an amazing gravy with cashews in it. <br /><br />The nutty and sweet Kashmiri naan was also incredible. I loved the cardamom! Next was the fragrant chicken biryani with garlic, onions, cumin, cardamom, and ginger. Adding raita made it creamy! <br /><br />Then, we enjoyed mango, rose, and salted lassis! The mango was creamy while the salted was unique and full of spices! We followed that with a creamy rice dessert called kheer with raisins, dried fruit, almonds, and pistachios, and some masala chai!<br /><br />Then, we drove 3 minutes to Curry Corner to try some Pakistani food! In the kitchen, they made garlic naan, seekh kebabs, dal, tandoori chicken, chapli kebabs, nihari, and masala fries with chicken tikka masala sauce, feta, and cilantro. It was salty, creamy, and unique!<br /> <br />First was the nihari, a rich beef stew with ginger, oil, chilies, and cilantro, with garlic naan. It‚Äôs rich, nutty, flavorful, and still subtle, and the beef is unbelievably tender. I loved it with the cheese naan.<br /><br />The monstrous chapli kabab had tomatoes cooked into it and was so rich without being overbearing with the spices. I also loved the potatoes, seekh kebabs, and chicken in the mixed platter. The tandoor gives it a juicy texture and smoky flavor!<br /><br />The chicken biryani was so colorful, fragrant, and fluffy, and full of turmeric, saffron, bay leaves,  cloves, peppercorns, and coriander. It had some spice to it! Then, we finished with a thicker kheer with pistachios in a biodegradable clay bowl.<br /><br />Finally, we took a two-hour break and then drove 45 minutes to Desi Gaadi, a food truck in North Phoenix. They sell Indian street food, including samosa chaat, goat pepper fry, papdi chaat, punugulu, masala vada, chicken pakoda, and more!<br /><br />We went with the goat pepper fry, samosa chaat, samosas, and punugulu. The goat pepper fry came with raw onions and was so tender it fell apart! It‚Äôs one of my favorite dishes I‚Äôve had in a long time! <br /><br />The samosa chaat was full of onions, mint chutney, sev, chickpeas, and yogurt. Then, we had the punugulu, which are crispy fritters made from dosa batter that you dip into peanut chutney. It tasted just like a dosa! The onion samosas were bursting with flavor!<br /><br />What an unbelievable experience eating Indian food with Mark Wiens in Phoenix, Arizona!<br /><br />Where have you been?<br /><br />Subscribe Here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DavidsbeenhereSub">http://bit.ly/DavidsbeenhereSub</a><br />Top videos! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DavidsbeenhereTopVideos">http://bit.ly/DavidsbeenhereTopVideos</a><br /><br />Follow Me:<br />+ INSTAGRAM ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/davidsbeenhere">https://instagram.com/davidsbeenhere</a>  <br />+ FACEBOOK ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/davidsbeenhere">https://www.facebook.com/davidsbeenhere</a>  <br />+ TWITTER ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/davidsbeenhere">https://twitter.com/davidsbeenhere</a> <br />+ MY BLOG! ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://davidsbeenhere.com/">http://davidsbeenhere.com/</a> <br /><br />Contact Me:<br />+BUSINESS EMAIL ‚ñ∫ david@godandbeauty.com<br /><br />#Davidsbeenhere #Phoenix #IndianFood #DavidInPhoenix<br /><br />About Me:<br /><br />My name is David Hoffmann.
