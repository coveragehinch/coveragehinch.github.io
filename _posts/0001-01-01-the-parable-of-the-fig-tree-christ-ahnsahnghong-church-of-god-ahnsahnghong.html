{% raw %}Who Started the Gospel Work in 1948 According to the Parable of the Fig Tree?<br />Jesus told His disciples to learn the lesson from the fig tree to let us know the time when He will come to this earth again through the destruction and independence of Israel which is likened to the fig tree. <br /><br />God the Mother and the Church of God Testified by Christ Ahnsahnghong<br />Christ Ahnsahnghong fulfilled the prophecy of the fig tree as well as the prophecy of King David. He also let us know about God the Mother in Zion, which He established through the Passover of the New Covenant in the Age of the Holy Spirit. He is God who will save us.<br /><br />Matthew 24:32–33<br />“Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door.”<br /><br /> [This video is copyrighted by the World Mission Society Church of God.
