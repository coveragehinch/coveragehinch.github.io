{% raw %}In this video I show you an elegant traditional Christmas tablesetting for 5. This round table we use as our every day table for our family.  I start out with our table with our round green and cream colored 70% cotton tablecloth.  We start out with our gold charger plates purchased at Hobby Lobby.  I decided to go with my clear glass plates that were thrifted this year from Goodwill.  I love these plates they are so versatile.  The reason I decided to use the clear glass dinner plates was to accentuate our fabulous vintage Hallmark Christmas plates.  These were found at the flea market earlier in the year.  I am using our gold flatware along with our linen napkins with the gold napkin rings.  Earlier in the year we found the centerpiece vase at Dunn's Attic, when we went antique shopping.  That video link is here if you are interested:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/N2xD2B8IexE">https://youtu.be/N2xD2B8IexE</a><br />The arrangement I made for this brings in the holidays with elegance.  The white roses and gold picks gave it that elegant look that I was after for this table.
