{% raw %}Free Voice Lessons:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chrisliepe.com/free-your-voice/">https://chrisliepe.com/free-your-voice/</a><br />My Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chrisliepe.com">https://chrisliepe.com</a><br /><br />I've been asked for more tips on this subject for awhile now so I thought it was time I delivered!<br /><br />Here's the scenario:<br />-You have a song you want to sing<br />-You love the way it sounds in the original key but it's too high for you to sing well.<br />-Every time you try, you tense up and sound strangled .<br />-You can hit most or all of the notes in the song in isolation or with a less complicated melody.<br />-As soon as you try to sing in context, you lose all composure and get discouraged!<br /><br />Well... I've done a new video exactly addressing this struggle and how we can sing songs meant for higher voices, even though we have a lower natural voice than the singer in the song! (AND MAKE IT SOUND REALLY GOOD)<br /><br />For this example, I chose to sing a song by a female artist and demonstrate how to approach the original key, melody and phrasing in a healthy and great sounding way!{% endraw %}
