{% raw %}Taiwan is asking for help! China warns of 'fight to the finish' if confronted over Taiwan.<br />The Chinese government has warned it is prepared to confront the US over Taiwan and labelled the self-ruling island a &quot;wanderer&quot;.<br />In a speech, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing &quot;will fight to the finish&quot; if challenged by the US over the democratically-governed island.<br />Speaking in Beijing yesterday, Mr Wang said the cause of current tensions was the Taiwan government's attempts to &quot;rely on the United States for independence&quot;, Reuters reports.<br />Taiwan is a flourishing democracy but the mainland's ruling Chinese Communist Party continues to view the island as an inseparable part of its territory - despite having never controlled it.<br />Mr Wang reiterated China's goal of bringing Taiwan under control of the mainland government.<br />He said Taiwan was a &quot;wanderer&quot; that will eventually return home and not a chess piece to be played.<br />&quot;Taiwan is a wanderer who will eventually come home, not a chess piece to be used by others. China must and will be reunified,&quot; Mr Wang said.<br />Taiwan and mainland China have been separately governed since the Nationalists retreated to the island at the end of the Chinese civil war more than 70 years ago.<br />Tensions between China and the US over Taiwan reached new heights this year.<br /><br />IMPORTANT! <br />-None of these images, music &amp; video clips were created/owned by us. -This video is purely fan-made, if you (owners) have seen your content and want to remove this video, please message us privately or mail us<br />JustFor12345xyz@gmail.com<br />before doing anything.
