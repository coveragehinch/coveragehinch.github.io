But all that changed in the year 2018, when I discovered Fluid art. I was able to let my imagination run wild and pour it out on the canvas. I have finally found my place in art that perfects and makes me happy. And what could be nicer than sharing this with others through my artwork. Because of this, I also decided to share my artistic path on youtube, where I am happy to share my passion and knowledge with more than a quarter of a million people from all over the world.<br />Join me on my Fluid art journey!<br />*************************************************************************************************<br />Please understand that I am in no way responsible for the way you use your paint and mediums.
