{% raw %}Hey everyone! Today's video is a little different because I'm reviewing a home item. I am so, so, so excited that I get to work with Big Fig Mattress and bring you this review. I've known about Big Fig for years, and I got to meet their team when I went to Atlanta for the TCF Expo. I contacted them to see if they wanted to work together because I was so interested in their product. <br /><br />I was gifted the mattress, foundation, and frame for the purpose of a review. I was not paid to make a video. All opinions are my own.<br /><br />Big Fig is a mattress specifically made for a bigger figure. It holds more weight and has better materials for heavier people. They recently launched a quicker shipping method by providing their mattress in a box, so I tested this out and put together the bed myself. I hope you enjoy the video -- It's very thorough! <br /><br />I am now an affiliate of Big Fig and have my own discount code.
