{% raw %}Our guest speaker on September 5, is the Rev. Michael Dowd. Since April 2002, Michael and his wife (UU science writer and fellow climate activist Connie Barlow) have traveled North America delivering talks in some 500 UU congregations, summer camps, and minister retreats, as well as for other religious and secular groups. Their pro-science, pro-future ministry was featured as the cover story of our national membership magazine, UU World, in the spring of 2006. They’ve also been featured in major media throughout the U.S. and Canada, and Michael and Connie were honored as 2016 “UU Religious Humanists of the Year” at General Assembly in Columbus, Ohio.<br /><br />Michael will engage in a discussion of his 25-minute video presentation, “Serenity Prayer for the 21st Century: Pro-Future Love-in-Action,&quot; which you are invited to watch between now and then. That program expands on content in his two TEDx talks and his book, Thank God for Evolution, which was endorsed by 6 Nobel Prize-winning scientists, noted skeptics, and by religious leaders across the spectrum. Date is September 8, 2021.{% endraw %}
