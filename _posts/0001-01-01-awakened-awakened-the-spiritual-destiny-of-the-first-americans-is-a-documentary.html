{% raw %}AWAKENED: the Spiritual Destiny of the First Americans is a documentary film featuring up to the minute accounts of what God is doing in and through the First Nations people. It has been 40 years since Billy Graham made the iconic statement, ‘you as Indians are a sleeping giant. The original American, you are now awakening. Just around the corner, you may become a spiritual superpower in this country that could change not only America, but the world.” The First Americans are now awake and stepping into their spiritual destiny, a destiny that holds the keys to revival and America’s future in its hands!<br /> <br />Hear first-hand from cutting-edge native pastors/leaders from the Navajo Nation, America’s largest tribe, as well as Lakota, Mohawk and others. Listen to prophetic voices that say we are on the verge of what may be the ‘Last Great Awakening’ and that the First Nations people will lead the way. Learn of the divine connections that have developed with China, Korea and Israel and meet the new President and Vice President of the Navajo Nation, miraculously appointed by God!<br /> <br />An important film for ‘such a time as this’, Awakened will inspire native and non-native alike to step into God's promise and purpose; a tool to ignite revival born of awakening! Featuring Ellson Bennett, Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye and Vice-President Jonathan Nez, Quincy GoodStar, Ron &amp; Tyda Harvey, Jerry Tom, Bonnie Chavda, Alvin Cheah, Ray Kirkland and many more.  Including the voice of Dr. Billy Graham from his 1975 historical address to the First Americans and an all original native American-themed score.<br /><br />Additional info available at www.awakenedfirstnations.com{% endraw %}
