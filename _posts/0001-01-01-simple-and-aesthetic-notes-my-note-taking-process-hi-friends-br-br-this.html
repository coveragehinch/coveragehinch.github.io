{% raw %}☆ hi friends!<br /><br />This video is all about my note-taking process, which I have finally solidified after three years of high school! my notes are pretty simple and minimal, which has helped me save time when writing them and referring back to them. i had a lot of fun talking about my tips, but it was my first time doing an unscripted voiceover— sorry if i’m awkwardly rambling at parts oops. i hope you find some parts helpful, and feel free to ask me any questions :)  all the best in your studies!<br /><br />— love, jia ♡ <br /><br />#studying #notetaking #howitakenotes<br /><br />SHOP<br />↠ get my handwriting font: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gum.co/jiashandwritingextended">https://gum.co/jiashandwritingextended</a><br /><br />SOCIAL MEDIA<br />↠ instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/canshestudy/">https://www.instagram.com/canshestudy/</a><br />↠ spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/2hwa5xa6owhd0oddg7instl7m?si=gABanmKKRkaItfQDCkOqzQ&amp;dl_branch=1">https://open.spotify.com/user/2hwa5xa6owhd0oddg7instl7m?si=gABanmKKRkaItfQDCkOqzQ&amp;dl_branch=1</a><br /><br />CONTACT<br />↠ canshestudy@gmail.com<br /><br />MUSIC<br />↠ pair piano: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/PairPiano">https://youtube.com/c/PairPiano</a><br />↠ “tied up” by wade graves<br /><br />have an amazing day!{% endraw %}
