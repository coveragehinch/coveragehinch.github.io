{% raw %}You don't have to be an expert Do-It-Yourselfer to order a heating and air unit for your home. This customer didn't know how to install a new HVAC system, but still got a great deal. He ordered the unit from Ingram, saved money on the purchase, then found a local contractor to provide the labor. He did it right, you can too.{% endraw %}
