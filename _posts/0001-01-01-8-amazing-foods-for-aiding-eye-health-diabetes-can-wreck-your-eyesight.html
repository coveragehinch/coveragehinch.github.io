But which foods can aid your eye health? <br />► ► FREE BOOK + FREE DOCUMENTARY EPISODE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.diabetessmarts.com/go/superfoods">https://www.diabetessmarts.com/go/superfoods</a> <br />► ► JOIN DIABETES SMARTS: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://diabetessmarts.com">https://diabetessmarts.com</a> ​<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Discover 8 eye-opening foods to help you fight high blood sugar while improving the health of your eyes.<br /><br />1) Vision loss, or macular degeneration, is a major concern when it comes to the long-term effects of diabetes.  Excessive amounts of sugar in the bloodstream, over time, can lead to eyesight issues, including cataracts, glaucoma, and retinopathy.<br /><br />2) Research has found that there are several key nutrients that can work wonders for eye health, specifically certain powerful antioxidants, including vitamins A, C, and E, beta carotene, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, plus the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin.<br /><br />3) A serving of pumpkin seeds contains over 50% of the RDI for zinc, which can support the health of the retina, cell membranes, and protein structure of our eyes.<br /><br />4) Salmon is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to decrease the risk of macular degeneration.  <br /><br />5) Flax seeds contain a great amount of alpha-linolenic acid, which aids the proper functioning of cell membranes within the eyes, and it can also work to reduce macular degeneration.<br /><br />6) A serving of almonds contains 37% of the RDI for vitamin E, which has been shown to reduce the progression of macular degeneration as well as helping to prevent cataracts.  <br /><br />7) One teaspoon of cod liver oil contains 90% of the RDI for vitamin A and it also contains 100% of the RDI for vitamin D.  Both of these antioxidants have been shown to aid eye health by protecting the cornea, preventing cataracts and glaucoma. <br /><br />8) Orange sweet potatoes contain a great amount of beta carotene, which can aid the health of the cornea while decreasing the stress our eyes receive from blue electronic screen lighting.  <br /><br />9) Kiwi fruit contains carotenoids which have been shown to protect the retina while reducing the risk of cataracts and macular degeneration.<br /><br />10) Eggs contain free-radical-fighting compounds which have been shown to decrease the risk of age-related macular degeneration and cataracts.{% endraw %}
