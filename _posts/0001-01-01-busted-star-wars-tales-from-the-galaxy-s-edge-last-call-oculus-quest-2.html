You’ll fight alongside classic characters like R2-D2 and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and face intimidating villains, like Guavian Death Gang cell leader Tara Rashin (Debra Wilson). Visit Seezelslak (Bobby Moynihan) in his cantina to pick up missions that will take you into the wilds of Batuu — or become part of an all-new tale alongside Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz) himself.<br /><br />In Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge, you play a droid repair technician who crashed on planet Batuu after a pirate attack. In typical Star Wars fashion, you get swept up in a grand adventure, proving that anyone can become a hero. <br /><br />With Last Call, fans continue their adventures in the Outer Rim, taking on unexpected alliances and deadly enemies alike. Players will experience more eras and places in the Star Wars galaxy through Seezelslak’s legendary Tales and so much more in this epic conclusion. Find out more about how Baron Attsmun, Lens Kamo, and you intertwine throughout this adventure in the Batuu wilds.<br /><br />I hope you guys enjoyed this Star Wars Tales From the Galaxy's Edge gameplay on the Oculus Quest 2!
