{% raw %}I hear a lot of people referring to BBC English, RP (received pronunciation), or the Queen's English as &quot;standard English&quot; or &quot;standard pronunciation&quot; but in this episode I explain why I don't think this is quite right. <br /><br />Listening to natural conversational English is the most effective way to understand and replicate native English speakers. For that reason I talk naturally but a bit easier about everyday topics in everyday English so you can learn to understand and speak real native-like English. <br />Don't forget to like, subscribe, and share! <br /><br />Take an online lesson with me <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://italki.com/englishwithliam">http://italki.com/englishwithliam</a><br />Support me<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/easynaturalenglish">https://www.patreon.com/easynaturalenglish</a><br />Listen to previous podcast episodes<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anchor.fm/easy-natural-english">https://anchor.fm/easy-natural-english</a>{% endraw %}
