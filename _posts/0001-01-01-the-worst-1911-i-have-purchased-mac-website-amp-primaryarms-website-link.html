The 1911 was a great military pistol and it survived long past its expected service life and is still in wide spread use today. However, not all 1911's are created the same. The worst 1911 I bought I have kept because it's somewhat rare these days. But it still is a complete mess.<br /><br />#1911 #reliable #problems{% endraw %}
