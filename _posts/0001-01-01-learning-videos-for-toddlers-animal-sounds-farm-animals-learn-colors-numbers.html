{% raw %}Have your toddler learn from a real teacher, Ms Rachel!  Your toddler will learn animal sounds, farm animals, and learn colors, words and numbers in this toddler learning video! Our videos for toddlers encourage speech, language development, and teach phonics, letters and letter sounds. We hope to help your child learn to talk or develop their language skills further. Our learning videos for toddlers also teach social emotional skills. We alternate important lessons with fun kids songs and movement. Our songs encouragement gestures, which are building blocks of speech. We also use fun toys in ways that encourage interaction and speech development. Our videos are designed to be incredibly interactive, not passive watching, which is shown through research to be most beneficial for young children. We include animal sounds for kids which are great for speech practice. <br /><br />We have many more educational videos for babies, toddlers and preschoolers on our YouTube Channel so please check out more of our shows! We’d love to have you as part of the Songs for Littles family. Check out our Talking Time, Learn To Talk, First Words, Baby Sign Language, Phonics, Music Classes, Learn with Ms Rachel and our Preschool for Littles Videos! <br /><br />If you think your child has a speech delay, definitely talk to your pediatrician now. You may qualify for free speech therapy through your state's early intervention program. You can also get evaluated by a speech therapist. The earlier you do this, the better! Rachel is not a speech therapist, herself. She is a music teacher with a masters in music education. We do have a speech therapist on our team. <br /><br />Ms Rachel has a masters degree in music education from NYU. She has also been a toddler teacher at a school for children with special needs including autism, apraxia, speech delays, developmental delays, down syndrome and cerebral palsy. She has worked in homes to support families with children with special needs. She believes all children are gifted, precious and our teachers as well! <br /><br />We put a lot of time, care and research into each learning video for toddlers we create. These are great videos for teaching toddlers preschool readiness skills! They are full of preschool lessons that are great for 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds, 4 year olds and even 5 year olds or older!  Many people are involved in designing our videos. On our team we have: a speech-language pathologist, a reading specialist, a Broadway musician, an early childhood curriculum specialist, a child and family therapist, and award-winning songwriters! If you have a baby, 1 year old, 2-year-old, 3-year-old, 4-year-old or 5-year-old, our channel is perfect for you! These are some of the best educational videos for kids you will find. Our Learn To Talk for Toddlers videos show First Words and functional speech may be helpful to children with speech delays or speech disorders. These are very interactive baby videos for babies to watch. We have the best learning video for toddlers around. <br /><br />We put your baby first and not entertainment value. That is why there is no loud music during the presentation of words. Even parents enjoy the educational videos we create.
