I bought it with the best warranty in the business expecting it to break and have tons of problems. After that we'd report back with how much money the repairs cost and how much I saved with the warranty. That's not what ended up happening, the truck went in to CarMax for service 3 times, and only one was actually an expensive repair. I'd say we're doing a bit better than break-even right now, but there is still quite a bit of warranty left, we'll have to see if it breaks again.<br /><br />F-250 Wix Oil Filter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.oreillyauto.com/detail/c/xp/filters-16470/engine-oil-filter-12090/80c2d8dbb188/wix-xp-oil-filter/wixx/57151xp">https://www.oreillyauto.com/detail/c/xp/filters-16470/engine-oil-filter-12090/80c2d8dbb188/wix-xp-oil-filter/wixx/57151xp</a><br /><br />MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shopWatchJRGo.com">http://shopWatchJRGo.com</a><br />Shop Motul: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://motul.com">http://motul.com</a><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Common Questions:<br /><br />What motorcycle do I ride?
