Potatoes<br /><br />Potatoes are nutrient-jammed and really one of the world’s most perfect foods.<br /><br />A single large potato contains lots of Potassium, Magnesium, Iron, Copper and Manganese… with plenty of vitamin C and most of the B vitamins.<br /><br />They contain a little bit of almost every nutrient we need and there have been accounts of people living on nothing but potatoes for a long time.<br /><br />They are also one of the most fulfilling foods in existence. When researchers compared the “satiety value” of different foods, boiled potatoes scored higher than any other food they measured.<br /><br />If you cook the potatoes and then allow them to cool afterwards, they also form large amounts of resistant starch, which is a fiber-like substance with many additional health benefits.<br /><br />2. Blueberries<br /><br />Although not as high in vitamins and minerals as vegetables (calorie for calorie), the antioxidant content is where these tiny fruits really shine.<br /><br />Blueberries are loaded with powerful antioxidants that protect our bodies from damage by unstable molecules called 'free radicals'.<br /><br />In fact, they contain the highest antioxidant capacity of ALL commonly consumed fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />The fact that they are colorful and taste good, and that the frozen ones are still very healthy, is just a bonus.<br /><br />3. Salmon and Tuna<br /><br />Not all fish is created equal. Salmon, tuna and other fatty types of fish contain the greatest amount of Omega-3 fats, which are extremely important for the optimal function of your body. <br /><br />Other than omega-3s, fatty fish also pack a massive amount of other nutrients. For example, salmon is rich in high quality protein and contains a lot of vitamins and minerals… including large amounts of Magnesium, Potassium, Selenium and all the B-vitamins.<br /><br />It's a good idea to eat fatty fish at least once or twice a week, to get all the Omega-3s that your body (and brain) desperately need.<br /><br />In fact, studies suggest those who eat fatty fish regularly have a lower risk of heart disease, and maybe even dementia and depression.<br /><br />4. Shellfish<br /><br />Clams, oysters and various other types of shellfish are among the most nutritious foods available, yet people rarely eat them.<br /><br />Clams are among the best sources of vitamin B12 in existence, with a 100 grams of clams supplying over 16 times the RDA or recommended dietary allowance.<br /><br />Oysters are also incredibly nutritious; 100 grams of oysters supplies 6 times the RDA for Zinc, 2 times the RDA for Copper, along with large amounts of B12 and Vitamin D.<br /><br />Shellfish can also be considered a great food for people who want to be as close to vegetarian as possible, while also getting most of the benefits of consuming animal foods. Because shellfish are considered non-sentient, which means they don't have the capacity to feel or perceive any sensations.<br /><br />Further reading: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://authoritynutrition.com/11-most-nutrient-dense-foods-on-the-planet/">https://authoritynutrition.com/11-most-nutrient-dense-foods-on-the-planet/</a><br /><br />Follow Authority Nutrition: <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AuthorityNutrition/">https://www.facebook.com/AuthorityNutrition/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AuthNutrition">https://twitter.com/AuthNutrition</a><br />Google Plus: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+Authoritynutrition/posts">https://plus.google.com/+Authoritynutrition/posts</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/authynutrition/">https://www.pinterest.com/authynutrition/</a><br /><br />---- Don't forget to subscribe on YouTube here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AuthorityNutrition?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/AuthorityNutrition?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Studies mentioned in video: <br /><br />Study 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7498104">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7498104</a><br />Study 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16825676">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16825676</a>{% endraw %}
