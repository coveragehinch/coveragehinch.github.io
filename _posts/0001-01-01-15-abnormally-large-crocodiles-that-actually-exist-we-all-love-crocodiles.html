Because the last thing you want to do is get too close to one of these huge reptiles, who are known throughout the world for their incredible strength and power, as well as a large number of very sharp teeth. These are some of the greatest predators of all time, and they have more or less been around since the dinosaurs were here. Which goes to show just how successful they are, and how easily they can adapt. As long as there’s a murky pool and some other thirsty animals around, then crocodiles will always have enough to eat.

From the saltwater giant to the Sri Lankan croc who got himself stuck because of his size, here’s 15 Abnormally Large Crocodiles That Actually Exist!<br /><br />► For copyright matters please contact us: OfficialAmerikano@hotmail.com{% endraw %}
