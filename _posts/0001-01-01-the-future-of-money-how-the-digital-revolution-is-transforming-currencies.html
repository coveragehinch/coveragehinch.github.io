{% raw %}The world of finance is at the threshold of major disruption that will affect corporations, bankers, states, and indeed all of us. The transformation of money will fundamentally rewrite how ordinary people live. In this talk, Eswar Prasad predicts that the era of cash is drawing to an end, as central banks are spurred by the emergence of cryptocurrencies to develop their own, more stable digital currencies. Meanwhile, he says, cryptocurrencies themselves will evolve unpredictably as global corporations like Facebook and Amazon join the game. The changes will be accompanied by snowballing innovations that are reshaping finance and have already begun to revolutionize how we invest, trade, insure, and manage risk.{% endraw %}
