Still, Apple says that its December quarter will be the company’s largest in terms of revenue in its history.<br /><br />Apple CFO Luca Maestri said in a call with analysts that iPad sales would decline year-over-year in the December quarter due to supply constraints while other product categories would grow.<br /><br />“So we’ve finished about a month of the quarter. The Covid related manufacturing disruptions have improved greatly. The chip shortages linger on,” Cook said.  <br /><br />Cook said that the supply issues were with chips on “legacy nodes,” or older chips, instead of the technologically advanced processors at the heart of Apple’s devices.  <br />The expectation of year-over-year sales growth suggests that Apple sees significantly more demand for its new iPhone 13 models than it can supply. Apple’s fourth quarter only included a few days of iPhone 13 sales as it ended on Sept. 25. <br /><br />Apple is currently in the middle of massive growth as sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs exploded during the pandemic. Apple’s annual revenue for its fiscal 2021 was up 33% from 2020 to $366 billion. <br /><br />The strongest growth in Apple product categories aside from iPhones was in its services business, which includes sales from the App Store, music and video subscription services, advertising, extended warranties, and licensing. Apple’s services grew 26% annually, which Cook said was higher than the company expected.  <br /><br />Cook said that Apple has 745 million paid subscriptions, which not only includes first-party services like Apple Music but also subscriptions through Apple’s App Store.  <br /><br />“That’s up 160 million year on year, which is up five times in five years. So it’s been quite the growth cycle,” Cook said.  <br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a> <br /><br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
