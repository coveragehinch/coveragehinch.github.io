{% raw %}Biologic Architecture-Deep Science and Application-Dan Winter, Juan Schlosser, Alosha Lynov -  part of <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ConsciousEarthAlliance.com">http://ConsciousEarthAlliance.com</a> Nov. Conference.<br />BioArch- ref-  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bioarchitects.net">http://bioarchitects.net</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goldenmean.info/architecture">http://goldenmean.info/architecture</a><br />The electrical science of biologic architecture<br />Sacred space and life force inside a seed are both defined by the same engineering. The charge field must be centripetal or fractal<br />or implosive. Measuring the frequencies of buildings proves that harmonic implosion is the true electrical science of creating structures which cause seeds and children to grow, see <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://flameinmind.com/lifeforce">http://flameinmind.com/lifeforce</a> .<br />Our international curriculum teaching biologic architecture is in use around the world: goldenmean.info/architecture and bioarchitects.net Creating this living space requires using biologic materials (high dielectric) aligning to magnetic grids and avoiding things like steel, aluminum and electro-smog. The ancients knew how to create sacred space which could heal and cause seeds to activate. It is urgent that we learn this electrical science which in essence is the ‘fractal field’ of implosion.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fractalfield.com ">http://fractalfield.com </a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://theraphi.net">http://theraphi.net</a>   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://flameinmind.com">http://flameinmind.com</a><br />Juan Schlosser – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bioarc.co">http://www.bioarc.co</a><br />￼Juan Schlosser is a bioarchitect and the founder of Bio Arc. The theme of his work is nature energy in all its forms and manifestations.<br />Based in Bali, Juan as co-founder of ‘The New Earth Project’ and founder of Bio Arc, continues expanding the vision of bio architecture as a medium to redefine architectural practices and contribute to generating a scientific design basis to creating a regenerative architectural system.<br />Applications and experience from a biologic architect<br />Juan will present his professional work as a biologic architect and design engineer. His legendary bamboo structures have unique energetic qualities beneficial to all living systems.<br />Inspired by Dan Winter’s life work, Juan will discuss measurement of buildings, confirming how charge signatures (fractal and centripetal) actually correlate to seed germination and life force. “If life force equals the ability to attract and self-organize capacitive charge, it becomes possible to define the real function of architecture. One reason architecture should look like biology is that biological structures have discovered through evolution the materials and shapes which allow the electrical fields we call life to converge into self-organization and self-awareness”. (Dan Winter – www.goldenmean.info)<br />Juan has also developed electrical measurement and techniques for implosion in water, identical in principle to electrical implosion in sacred architecture.<br />Bio-Architecture is the art of designing and building spaces enhancing living systems.<br />Through organic shapes, fractal patterns, certain proportions and bio-resonant ecological building materials it is possible to create functional and sacred space that nurtures and heals the body, mind and spirit.<br />This is key to reestablishing a symbiotic relationship between man and nature.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bioarchitects.net/ ">https://www.bioarchitects.net/ </a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bioarc.co/ ">https://www.bioarc.co/ </a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://newearthproject.org/ ">https://newearthproject.org/ </a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://newearth.university/ ">https://newearth.university/ </a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://newearth.university/schools/science-design-innovation/ ">https://newearth.university/schools/science-design-innovation/ </a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.adolfoschlosser.com/ ">http://www.adolfoschlosser.com/ </a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.chiorganizer.com/ ">http://www.chiorganizer.com/ </a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH_EzgM79qm5va9V6g77eFA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH_EzgM79qm5va9V6g77eFA</a><br />– Panel 2, Integrating bio-architectural small budget dwelings in natural environments: Since 2007 Alosha Lynov has been crafting geometric affordable individual and village level eco habitats.<br />Alosha Lynov – www.bioveda.co<br />￼Since 2007 Alosha Lynov has been developing a living habitat that merges nature with curvilinear interactive play space into one cohesive Living Bio Shelter organism that protects and nourishes the people living within whilst being able to withstand the extreme cold weather without conventional heating.<br />He recently relocated to Russia to develop Wautillarium Eco Home for Subzero t°. Once complete, this permaculture-inspired biological eco dwelling will heat and cool itself with laws of physics as well as thermophilic bacteria that thrive on human waste, producing compost for food production. The water cycle will loop between shower and food growing and water treating botanical cells.<br />Alosha is a natural builder, designer, and inventor who has synthesized the greatest minds of the planet in the fields of water ecosystem design, living machines, Augmented Reality parametric vault eco-construction to develop autonomous home that is buriable ..<br />His passion is to share a functional hands-on DIY building techniques creatively infused with the laws of physics, biology, bio geometry, biomimicry, soil regeneration, water filtration as well as augmented reality.<br />Owner-build Living Bio Shelter Organism<br />In my presentation, I will share my designs, methods, experiences and realisations that I’ve gained after two decades of building curvilinear art-forms and Bio-Shelters based on sacred geometry.{% endraw %}
