{% raw %}Cryptography is tricky. Sure, everybody knows not to roll out their own crypto, but is it enough? Are the standard algorithms, libraries, and utilities always used the right way? This is of course a rhetorical question! Humans keep making mistakes that other humans can exploit, and Murphy’s law continues to prove true: “If there is a wrong way to do something, then someone will do it.”<br /><br />In this talk, not only will we discuss what can go wrong, but also how attackers could take advantage of that. Insufficient entropy? Static initialization vector? Key reuse in stream cipher? Lack of ciphertext integrity? We’ve heard these terms and may be familiar with them in theory, but let’s see actual examples of these and other crypto mistakes and corresponding exploits, and understand how they could lead to real life problems. Are you not on a red team and not interested in exploitation? Then this talk is for you too! Come and learn how to avoid common crypto mistakes in your code!<br /><br />PUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:<br />Original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
