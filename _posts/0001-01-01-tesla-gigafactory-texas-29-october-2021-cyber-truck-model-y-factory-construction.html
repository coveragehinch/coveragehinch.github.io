{% raw %}Gigafactory Texas on 29 October 2021! This is where the Cyber Truck and Model Y will be built!<br /><br />     Beautiful morning but wind will pick up later in the morning and afternoon. I was able to get a lot of south end shots and some nice sunlit images on the east sides as well today. Winds began picking up towards the end, making drone flying a bit of a challenge at higher altitudes. <br /><br />     In this video, we look at some of the key highlights of note around the site today, including a few that may be signaling a new phase of construction beginning!  It seemed only appropriate to do a short 1-year ago “on-this-day” lookback to remind us of just how much has changed in that time.  Starting next month, we will begin doing a few 6-month and 3-month lookbacks to further reinforce the speed of progress at the site!<br /><br />Timestamps:<br />Drone flight key area overview with discussion &amp; illustrations: 0:06 to 3:27<br />“On-this-day” 1-year ago lookback: 3:28 to 4:40<br />Drone flight footage &amp; infographics: 5:05 to 28:28<br /><br />Here are the highlights from today's video:<br />- On the south end pond area, we take some close looks at the work underway, including what appears to be a deep drilling rig like the ones used in the central area ... this may indicate the start of pier drilling to start Phase 2 building extension (500 feet) as we discussed in previous videos.<br />- The central area is also very busy today, with a lot more steel delivered and assembly on-going. The truss-like structures have been installed forming the roof as we speculated about in the previous video, and more are being assembled on the ground. Columns on the east side next to the stamping structure are also going up this morning. Roof decking on the steel structure has also progressed quite a bit, almost to the end of the current structure! <br />- The General Assembly structure west glass panels are now almost completely installed, except for about 4 more large panes. We also see roofing work nearing completion on the south and west parts of the roof, and we look in from the south end to see some of the interior work underway. Finally, we look in from the central area to see the continuing work on the ground floor.<br />- The east side of the stamping structure walls, and window line continues to be worked on and we can see progress on the driveway slabs running north to south along the entire length of the building. On the north end, we see more wall panels being removed, likely to further extend the window line towards the casting structure.<br />- On the north end parking area, we see trenching and electrical utility lines being installed ... possibly for lighting but also might be for more charging stations. This entire north area had been transformed into a flat graded area now.<br />- The casting machine structure roof installation is accelerating, with another large area getting insulation and waterproof lining installed. The transition area to the paint shop appears completed, in a step-down configuration rather than the previous sloped ramp approach.<br />- Gas pipe installation along the east side up to the mobile batch plant continues, and we get some closer looks at several areas that are being worked on this morning. The speed of installation seems high, and it could be just a few more weeks until all of the pipe is installed.<br />- Finally, we look at the west side temporary storage area and see many interesting wall panels with cut-outs and different shapes ... this could be part of the increased window-lines we are seeing on the east side of the building.<br /><br />     Thank you for watching and I hope this has been informative, educational, and entertaining for you.
