The nuclear-armed North American XB-70 Valkyrie would fly more than three times the speed of sound and at an altitude of 75,000 feet. Only a handful of the XB-70’s would be needed to overwhelm any target. <br /><br />The Soviets would have just a few short years to respond to the threat by designing a new interceptor that could match the incredible performance of America’s XB-70 aircraft. But to guard the enormous air space of the Soviet Union, the interceptor would have to be quickly engineered and mass produced by the hundreds. <br /><br />The result would be the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25, an interceptor engineered to do one thing; climb, catch and bring down the American bomber. But the aircraft would end up as one of the most misunderstood jets of the Cold War. <br /><br />Select imagery/video supplied by Getty Images: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/">https://www.gettyimages.com/</a><br /><br />Song 1: &quot;Viking Warriors&quot; - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://audiojungle.net/item/viking-warriors/21112068">https://audiojungle.net/item/viking-warriors/21112068</a><br /><br />Song 2: “Retro Action Suspense Drone” - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/94648226-retro-action-suspense-drone">https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/94648226-retro-action-suspense-drone</a><br /><br />Song 3: “Guardians” - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/track/G2Uo2SL2Ca/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/track/G2Uo2SL2Ca/</a><br /><br />Song 4: “Digital Sci-Fi”- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://audiojungle.net/item/digital-scifi/19268503">https://audiojungle.net/item/digital-scifi/19268503</a><br /><br />Song 5:  “Unexpected Revelations”- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.premiumbeat.com/royalty-free-tracks/unexpected-revelations">https://www.premiumbeat.com/royalty-free-tracks/unexpected-revelations</a><br /><br />Song 6:  “Global Science 2020” - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/132910736-global-science-2020-2-minutes-corporate-inspirational-backgr">https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/132910736-global-science-2020-2-minutes-corporate-inspirational-backgr</a><br /><br />Song 7:  “Neon Drive” - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://audiojungle.net/item/neon-drive/30274487?s_rank=62">https://audiojungle.net/item/neon-drive/30274487?s_rank=62</a> <br /><br />Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
