{% raw %}Today I want to talk about color theory for beginners and specifically seasonal color analysis or the theory that breaks all colors into 2 main categories: Hue (either cool or warm) &amp; Value (either light or dark).<br /><br />Identifying which of these your hair, eyes and skin fall under can help you find the colors that will be in synergy with your coloring, and results in 4 harmonious color groups named after the 4 seasons of the year - <br /><br />winter (cool &amp; deep)<br />spring (warm &amp; light)<br />summer (cool &amp; light)<br />autumn (warm &amp; deep)<br /><br />If you have traits from 2 different seasons, you can use the updated model which includes your hue, value and chroma (the depth of your coloring and the contrast between your hair, eyes &amp; skin which can be either rich and saturated or muted). When these 3 are combined you get 12 seasons and I share all of them in this video. <br /><br />I hope this is helpful and thanks so much for watching! xx Audrey<br /><br />Subscribe here for more videos like this: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2pFnkE7">http://bit.ly/2pFnkE7</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: This is not a paid advertisement and is not a sponsored post.
