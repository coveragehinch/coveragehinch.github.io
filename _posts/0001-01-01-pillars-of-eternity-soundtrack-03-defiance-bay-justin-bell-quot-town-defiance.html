{% raw %}&quot;Town: Defiance Bay&quot;, composed and arranged by Justin Bell<br />from the original soundtrack to the game &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot; by Obsidian Entertainment.<br /><br />If you enjoy this music, you can get the full soundtrack as part of the Champion Edition of Pillars of Eternity, available now on Steam and GOG.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/291650/">http://store.steampowered.com/app/291650/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.gog.com/game/pillars_of_eternity_champion_edition">http://www.gog.com/game/pillars_of_eternity_champion_edition</a><br />Please support the creators, this is an awesome game, and they're really nailed it in bringing back the old-school RPG feel!<br /><br />NOTE: I claim absolutely no ownership over any of this, and will happily take it down if asked to by the owners. I just love this game and its music, and hope to spread that joy to others. <br /><br /><br /><br />(Also, I made up the &quot;order&quot; of the soundtrack, so apologies if it seems a tad off.){% endraw %}
