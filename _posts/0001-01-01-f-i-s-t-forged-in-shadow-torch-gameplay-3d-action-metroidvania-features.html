This isn’t as straightforward as mashing buttons together since you need to utilize every ability you have. You’re rewarded through heavy exploration as you discover more of the secrets of Torch City and uncover additional abilities to access locked passages.<br /><br />It’s easy to get immersed in the world while you try to figure out how to traverse certain areas, but I would’ve wished for the story and characters to be developed even more. It would also be cool if the amount of customization is expanded together with the number of unique weapons you’re able to wield. If you’re looking for a fun Metroidvania with arcade-style combat, a fantastic exploration system, and phenomenal audio and level design, then you may want to check out F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch. It’s already available on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 and costs 29.99 USD.
