{% raw %}Today we are over at Wild Booster for episode #16 of the $75,000 Bonus Buy Series. This slot can be pretty exciting, similar to Juicy Fruits you need to collect scatters in the bonus to progress through the different stages to get a better multiplier. You can also pick between one of two different bonus options that have different multiplier progress!
