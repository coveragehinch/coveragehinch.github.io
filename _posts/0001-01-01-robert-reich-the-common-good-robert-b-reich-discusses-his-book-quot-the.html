{% raw %}Robert B. Reich discusses his book, &quot;The Common Good&quot;, at a Politics and Prose event at Sixth and I historic synagogue in Washington, DC on 2/22/18.<br /><br />Robert B. Reich has been one of America's leading political thinkers since he served as Bill Clinton's Secretary of Labor, for which Time Magazine named him one of the ten most effective cabinet secretaries of the twentieth century. A constant voice for social change, Reich is the author of 14 books, including the best-sellers Saving Capitalism and The Work of Nations. Now, he makes the case for restoring the idea of the common good to the center of our economics, our politics, and our national identity. The Common Good argues that societies undergo both virtuous and vicious cycles, and that the vicious cycle the U.S. is now undergoing can and must be reversed. Reich challenges us to weigh what really matters, and to join forces to save America's soul.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9780525520498">https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9780525520498</a><br /><br />Founded by Carla Cohen and Barbara Meade in 1984, Politics and Prose Bookstore is Washington, D.C.'s premier independent bookstore and cultural hub, a gathering place for people interested in reading and discussing books.
