{% raw %}After the clean up and fitting adjustments of the Kerckhaert Comfort Sport shoe, Bobby gets ready to nail it on the right front. He chose the new Liberty Cu 4 Combo Slim nails. They are a great fit in the Comfort shoes and many 5/16&quot; thick shoes. The shorter length is more appropriate than than the 5 Combo Slim for smaller feet wearing sizes 00, 0 and even size 1. The Cu Liberty nails are a great option, especially in wetter conditions as the copper coating keeps them from rusting during the shoeing cycle.{% endraw %}
