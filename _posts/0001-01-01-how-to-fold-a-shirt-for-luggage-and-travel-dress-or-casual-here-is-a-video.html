{% raw %}Here is a video that I was asked to make by a subscriber. How to fold a dress shirt for your luggage. This fold can be used for any type of shirt. In this video I go over two types of folds that can be used. First is a regular fold the second is the type of fold used by factories when you receive the shirt as new from the store. You will be amazed at how they do it. If you have new suggestions for videos of please do post in the comments. Coming up next is another big giveaway I announce toward the end of the video so please watch. I only giveaway expensive stuff. See you all when I am back at it.{% endraw %}
