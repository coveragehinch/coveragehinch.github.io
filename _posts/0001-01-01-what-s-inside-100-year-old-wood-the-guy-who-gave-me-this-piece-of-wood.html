{% raw %}The guy who gave me this piece of wood claims it was from a house built in the 1920s. I'm not positive that's true, but I do know that it smelled pretty bad once I got to the inner wood, and it made nothing but sawdust! The grain ended up pretty interesting though; I kept thinking I was leaving tool marks, but really the grain had some parts that were almost like stripes. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cookwoodturning.com">https://www.cookwoodturning.com</a> to buy one of my pieces<br />My tools:<br />Laguna Lathe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3n6WxjS">https://amzn.to/3n6WxjS</a><br />TotalBoat Resin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.totalboat.com/product/high-performance-21-epoxy-kits/">http://www.totalboat.com/product/high-performance-21-epoxy-kits/</a><br />Finishing Oil: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2oAFPP6">https://amzn.to/2oAFPP6</a><br />Carbide Chisels: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NUiEdq">https://amzn.to/2NUiEdq</a><br />Face Shield: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Ac4Cvj">https://amzn.to/2Ac4Cvj</a><br />Center Finder: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ld06Ju">https://amzn.to/2ld06Ju</a><br />Nova Chuck: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/32tJvkm">https://amzn.to/32tJvkm</a><br />Miter Saw: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZpjuBW">https://amzn.to/2ZpjuBW</a><br />Drill: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2XtnW0G">https://amzn.to/2XtnW0G</a><br />Square: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VaCNzW">https://amzn.to/2VaCNzW</a><br />Clamps: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2UvPSiZ">https://amzn.to/2UvPSiZ</a><br /><br />*if you shop through these links I may receive a small commission.
