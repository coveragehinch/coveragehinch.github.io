{% raw %}The foundations of national security are rapidly expanding into the economic and technological fields due to technological innovation and geopolitical changes. The Japanese Government recently stated in government wide documents such as its Growth Strategy that it will strengthen and promote economic security policy. The speaker will introduce this subject in the first section.<br />In the meantime, while economic security policy is newly highlighted, free and fair trade remains an essential part of government policy towards developing the global economy and building a resilient supply chain. In this respect, in addition to various initiatives relating to global rule-making and trade promotion, the enforcement of trade tools such as trade remedy measures is also important in tackling unfair trade practices. The speaker will discuss recent developments in trade rules focusing on this aspect in the second section.<br /><br />Speaker<br />KAZEKI Jun (Director-General, Trade Control Department, Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureau, &amp; Director-General, Economic Security Policy, Minister's Secretariat, METI)<br />-Material: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rieti.go.jp/en/events/bbl/21090601_kazeki.pdf">https://www.rieti.go.jp/en/events/bbl/21090601_kazeki.pdf</a><br /><br />Commentator<br />KAWASE Tsuyoshi (Faculty Fellow, RIETI / Professor, Faculty of Law, Sophia University)<br />-Material: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rieti.go.jp/en/events/bbl/21090601_kawase.pdf">https://www.rieti.go.jp/en/events/bbl/21090601_kawase.pdf</a><br />SUZUKI Kazuto (Professor, Graduate School of Public Policy, The University of Tokyo)<br />-Material: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rieti.go.jp/en/events/bbl/21090601_suzuki.pdf">https://www.rieti.go.jp/en/events/bbl/21090601_suzuki.pdf</a>{% endraw %}
