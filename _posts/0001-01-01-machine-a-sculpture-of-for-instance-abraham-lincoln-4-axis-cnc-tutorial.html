{% raw %}Tutorial video for DeskProto Version 7. It shows the complete process of creating toolpaths and then machining a bust of Abraham Lincoln, in wood. First half of the video is about machining the sculpture, based on an STL file (with download link), the second half shows how to engrave text on the sockle, based on a DXF drawing file.<br />The result is a great statue: a credit for any US school or other government building when present in the entrance hall.<br /><br />* subtitles are available in English (click on &quot;CC&quot;).<br />* met ondertiteling in het Nederlands.{% endraw %}
