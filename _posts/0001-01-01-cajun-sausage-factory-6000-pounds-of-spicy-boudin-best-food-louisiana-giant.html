It has to be one of the world’s most addictive sausages and a complete meal all within a sausage casing. Today we’re going to The Best Stop Supermarket to learn how they make their Cajun boudin sausage, and to eat some as well!<br /><br />Before I traveled to Louisiana, I had never heard of boudin. And even in New Orleans, it’s rare to find. But head to Cajun country, like Lafayette, and specifically Soctt, which is just 10 minutes away, and you’ll be surrounded by one of the most beloved of all Cajun foods. Boudin is a sausage, made from meat (usually pork) scraps, mixed with rice, and Cajun pepper seasonings, and filled into a natural intestines casing. Traditionally, boudin is boiled or steamed, but now you’ll also find it commonly smoked. What I loved so much about boudin is that it’s a complete meal including rice, meat, and spices, all in a natural skin. And on top of that, it’s extremely tasty and addictive - the meat and rice combo, the Cajun spices and cayenne pepper.<br /><br />We first took a tour of the state of the art sausage factory at The Best Stop Supermarket. My favorite part was the sausage filling room where you’ll never see unraveling intestines move faster in your life.<br /><br />I tried a variety of boudin products, but for me the best are both the boiled and smoked boudin. What I learned is that boudin is not only a food enjoyed and loved, but it’s a Cajun way of life!<br /><br />📍 The Best Stop Supermarket: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://g.page/BestStopSupermarket?share">https://g.page/BestStopSupermarket?share</a><br /><br />🎵MUSIC: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/HwVjdo">https://goo.gl/HwVjdo</a><br /><br />——————————————————<br /><br />🍌100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z">http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z</a><br /><br />👕Get t-shirts and caps:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://migrationology.com/store/">https://migrationology.com/store/</a><br /><br />——————————————————<br /><br />📱FOLLOW:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/migrationology">https://instagram.com/migrationology</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/migrationology">https://www.facebook.com/migrationology</a>{% endraw %}
