We’ve surprisingly heard very little since the beta so I would imagine thinks start to ramp up big time ahead of Vangaurd’s release. Today we ended up getting the first part of that in regards to a new blog post from Sony and PlayStation detailing some information regarding Call of Duty Vanguard’s campaign characters, some new maps we haven’t yet seen before, some new and returning weaponry and unfortunately… The confirmation that exclusives will be returning here in some capacity for PlayStation users vs the rest of the platforms.<br /><br />All that and more has been on the discussion board today in regards to Call of Duty Vanguard so we’re going to break down everything you need to know to keep you in the loop. That said, as what’s your take on all of this? Is it good to see more Vanguard campaign info? How about the Vanguard maps that we haven’t quite seen just yet? How about the exclusivity deals continuing on into Vanguard’s main year of support? Feel free to let me know, but in the mean time… This is VANGUARD: The NEW GAMEPLAY, Maps, Weapons And Exclusives Teased...<br /><br />►Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eColiEspresso">https://twitter.com/eColiEspresso</a><br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ecoliespresso/">https://www.instagram.com/ecoliespresso/</a><br />►Get 10% Off GFuel with code &quot;Espresso&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gfuel.ly/2GI15Zv">https://gfuel.ly/2GI15Zv</a><br />►Check out ArtesianBuilds: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artesianbuilds.com/gaming/?aff=Espresso">https://artesianbuilds.com/gaming/?aff=Espresso</a><br />►Get 5% Off Scuf with code &quot;Espresso&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://scuf.co/Espresso">http://scuf.co/Espresso</a>{% endraw %}
