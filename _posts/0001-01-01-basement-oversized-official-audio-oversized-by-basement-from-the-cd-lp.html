When I hear this song I think of early Jets To Brazil and even some of the more melodic songs from Blur like ‘Coffee and TV’, especially with the harmonies at the end. <br /><br />Oversized is about being afraid to reveal who you really are to the people you care about and who care about you. I think this is sometimes hard because they are the people that matter to you the most and even though you assume they will accept you for who you are, you're still so scared and in need of their approval.” - vocalist Andrew Fisher<br /><br /><br />Subscribe to Run For Cover on YouTube to stay updated on all out releases: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/runforcovertube">http://www.youtube.com/user/runforcovertube</a><br /><br />Videos, news and more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.runforcoverrecords.com">http://www.runforcoverrecords.com</a><br />Like RFC on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fb.com/runforcoverrecords">http://fb.com/runforcoverrecords</a><br />Follow RFC on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/rfcrecords">https://twitter.com/rfcrecords</a><br />Read our Tumblr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://runforcoverrecords.tumblr.com">http://runforcoverrecords.tumblr.com</a>{% endraw %}
