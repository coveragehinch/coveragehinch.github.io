{% raw %}It took 176 Watt-Hours going into the Inverter, to run the Charger, to refill Battery # 1 after this Run..., of which 26 W/Hr was used by the Inverter &amp; Charger, and 7 W/Hr warmed the Battery from 15 Celsius to 23 Celsius, in going from 38.5 Volts to 41.8 Volts, over 2 &amp; 1/4 Hours ; so 143 Watt/Hours actually went into the Battery and stayed there as recoverable Current....<br /><br />The previous trip, taking the same route, but not using the Lights for the return-half..., and only using the &quot;Pedal Assist&quot; at &quot;Level-9&quot;, took 135 W/Hrs Gross to recharge from ; or about 109 Watt/Hrs after deducting the cumulative inefficiencies...<br /><br />  So, running at full throttle and using Lights for half the Trip would mean a Range of only 17.5 Km from a 350 W/Hr Battery..., and my target is a 42 Km Round Trip....; so unless my # 1 Battery is a Dud, then one may have to aquire another pair of Spare Batteries, and thus be able to set out with one in the Bike &amp; 3 more ready to play Swapsies - every 10 or 15 Km...<br /><br />   It isn't quite what I was expecting..., but at this point one might as well plough ahead despite such minor obstacles.<br /><br />   It's only money.<br /><br />  And the Goal is to be able to go to town &amp; back on Stored Sunlight - without burning any Fossil Juice in order to do it.<br /><br />Such is life,<br /><br />Have a good one.<br /><br />;-p<br /><br />Ciao !{% endraw %}
