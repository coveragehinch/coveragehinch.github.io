{% raw %}Learn from Stanford doctor and leading expert in allergy treatment and prevention, Dr. Kari Nadeau, on how you can stop allergies early on. <br /><br />Dr. Kari Nadeau is the Naddisy Foundation Endowed Professor of Pediatric Food Allergy, Immunology, and Asthma at Stanford University and the director of the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University. For more than 30 years, she has devoted herself to understanding how environmental and genetic factors affect the risk of developing allergies and asthma, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the diseases.<br /><br />As one of the nation’s foremost experts in adult and pediatric allergy and asthma, Dr. Nadeau's research is laying the groundwork for a variety of potential future therapies to prevent and cure allergies and asthma. She leads a diverse team of specialists—in areas from immunology to chemical engineering—a team that was among the first to show that high dimensional immunophenotyping of T cells involved in allergy could be used in therapies for patients. Her research has also shown that blocking antibodies in conjunction with allergen immunotherapy produced desensitization even in patients with up to five food allergens. She has overseen more than 40 clinical trials and enrolled more than 2,000 patients in allergy studies. Her work has changed the lives of many who, for the first time in their lives, are able to control life-threatening food allergies.<br /><br />Dr. Nadeau received her MD and PhD from Harvard Medical School. She completed a residency in pediatrics at Boston Children's Hospital and a clinical fellowship in asthma and immunology at Stanford and at University of California, San Francisco. Her research and scientific breakthroughs have been covered in Lancet, JAMA, Nature Medicine, US News and World Report, New York Times Magazine and Discover Magazine, as well as other national and international media.<br /><br />Dr. Nadeau has served as a White House Medical Consultant, a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the EPA, NHLBI DSMB, NIH Study Sections, FARE Scientific Board, and a member of the American Lung Association Medical Board. She serves as the director of the Mechanism Committee for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and is a member of ASCI (American Society of Clinical Investigation). <br /><br />For more information about TEDxPaloAlto please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tedxpaloalto.com.">http://www.tedxpaloalto.com.</a>  <br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
