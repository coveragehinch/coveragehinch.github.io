{% raw %}HI everyone this is a video on how I burn pine in my central boiler CL 6048 classic outdoor wood boiler. Now pine in the woodstove area doesnt get much attention but in a outdoor wood boiler its GREAT firewood! Nice supplemental wood to mix in with the hardwoods plus its generally easier to source and often is free! My whole supply of pine is free!{% endraw %}
