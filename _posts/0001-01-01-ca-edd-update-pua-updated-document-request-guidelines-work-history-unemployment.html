{% raw %}CA EDD Update on the recent updated clarification for the EDD on PUA Work History Documentation requests that are continuing to go out.  Numerous PUA claimants reported having there previously submitted documentation rejected. It was also reported the EDD was incorrectly rejecting documentation which was later corrected by speaking to a EDD Tier 2 Representative. However, some PUA claimants who are submitting there 2020 tax returns are seeing rejections because they cannot establish work and income prior to the start of the PUA Claim. For those who fall under that scenario the EDD is asking for additional items to substantiate the claim such as receipts and invoices along with bank statements and so forth. Also updated guidance on those whoâ€™s self-employment plans were interrupted due to the pandemic, as well as those who planned to start a new traditional W-2 job which did not happen due to Covid.<br /><br /><br />#CAEDD #EDD #Unemployment{% endraw %}
