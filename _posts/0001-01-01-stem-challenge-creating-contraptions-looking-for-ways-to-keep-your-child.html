{% raw %}Looking for ways to keep your child #learningathome? #LakeshoreLearning is here to help…with our Kid Corner Learning Activities! In this video, we present a #STEM activity that challenges kids to build a handy #contraption—and use a #chainreaction to make it work! <br /><br />Kids love playing with blocks—cleaning them up afterward is another story. But what if they built a contraption that cleaned up the blocks for them? Join Lakeshore’s Kirk as he walks kids through every step of the process in creating a chain reaction-powered contraption to pick up blocks and drop them into a bin—from planning and sketching to testing and improving. It’s a fun, hands-on way to incorporate STEM into daily playtime! <br /><br />Visit our website to explore all of our free resources for learning at home: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/39ZnDAG">https://bit.ly/39ZnDAG</a><br /><br />Follow Lakeshore Learning on social media! <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/lakeshorelearning">http://facebook.com/lakeshorelearning</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/lakeshorelearning">http://instagram.com/lakeshorelearning</a> <br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pinterest.com/lakeshorelm">http://pinterest.com/lakeshorelm</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/LakeshoreLM">http://twitter.com/LakeshoreLM</a>{% endraw %}
