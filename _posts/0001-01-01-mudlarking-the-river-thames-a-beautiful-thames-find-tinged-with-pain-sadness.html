{% raw %}I love to think of the River Thames as a giant liquid story book. Each object can take the finder on a journey, and surprising stories can be uncovered. Not all stories are happy. Some can lead us to make surprising discoveries which bring up feelings of sadness.  In this episode we are celebrating Black History month and I meet up with Fran Sibthorpe for a mudlarking session in central London. Fran has been mudlarking for 6 years and has found some wonderful artefacts.   A while ago she found a small object which took her on a personal journey of discovery. <br /><br />If you are tempted to try mudlarking you do need a permit from the Port of London Authority.  You will find all the details here on their website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pla.co.uk/Environment/Thames-foreshore-permits">https://www.pla.co.uk/Environment/Thames-foreshore-permits</a><br /><br /><br />You can follow Fran Sibthorpe on instagram @franjoy7.<br /><br />You can follow me on twitter and instagram @tidelineart <br /><br />Thank you for watching.<br /><br />Nicola White<br />www.tidelineart.com{% endraw %}
