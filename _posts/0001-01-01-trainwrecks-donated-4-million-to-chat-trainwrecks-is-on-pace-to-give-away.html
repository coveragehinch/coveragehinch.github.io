{% raw %}Trainwrecks is on pace to give away 4 million dollars to his Twitch viewers by the end of this week, with NRG Fortnite star Ronaldo’s mom being the latest recipient, crying on stream after Train gifted her $100,000. <br /><br />Trainwrecks is often at the center of controversy on Twitch for his promotion of gambling streams on the platform, but the streamer has also given away an insane amount of money to his viewers, which winds up totaling over 4 million dollars after he completes his latest $250,000 giveaway this week. <br /><br />NRG Fortnite pro Stable Ronaldo’s own mom was the latest to get a massive donation from Trainwrecks, breaking down in tears after Train gifted her a bitcoin worth over $64,000, and then later coming back to donate more to make it an even $100,000. Ronaldo and his mother were both stunned and incredibly appreciative of Trainwrecks’ gift, praising the often criticized streamer. <br /><br />There will always be some level of controversy around Trainwrecks, as long as he keeps streaming and promoting gambling on his Twitch channel, but it is important to realize that while he may have helped sparked the gambling meta, he’s also the only streamer we have ever heard of who has given $4,000,000 away to his viewers and fans. <br /><br />#Trainwrecks #Twitch #Ronaldo  <br /><br /><br />// FOLLOW US<br /><br />Talent: <br />Jake: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky">https://twitter.com/JakeSucky</a><br />Hunter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HunterTheHerald">https://twitter.com/HunterTheHerald</a><br />Franke: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MegaphoneFranke">https://twitter.com/MegaphoneFranke</a><br /><br />Producer: <br />Peter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/VegasVanguards">https://twitter.com/VegasVanguards</a><br /><br />Check out our brand new channel, Gaming Shorts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/GamingShorts">https://bit.ly/GamingShorts</a><br /><br />Esports Talk is your leading source of gaming and esports news.
