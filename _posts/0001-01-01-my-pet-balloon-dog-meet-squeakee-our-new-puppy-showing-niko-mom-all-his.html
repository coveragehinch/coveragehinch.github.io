Dad and I have a really cool surprise for Mom and Niko! We got a NEW PET for our whole family!! It's Squeakee the Balloon Dog and he is so different from anything we have ever seen!! He's a balloon animal toy that does tricks!! When Dad and I brought him inside Mom and Niko Bear were so surprised and excited!! They were even more excited when we showed them all things that Squeakee could do! He can eat from an air pump, he follows directions with his ball and voice, and if we touch him with a pin he deflates!! But don't worry, He can inflate himself right back up on his feet! Squeakee loves playing with our family and loves belly and ear scratches!! I'm so excited that he is the newest member of our family!!<br />This video was sponsored by Moose Toys<br /> #Squeakee #Balloondog #AD<br /><br />Here's my new website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aforadley.com/">https://aforadley.com/</a><br /><br />my last video - PET VET with NiKO!!
