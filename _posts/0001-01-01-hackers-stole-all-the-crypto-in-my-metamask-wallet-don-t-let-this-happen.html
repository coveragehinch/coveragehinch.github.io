{% raw %}Woke up this morning to find all the crypto in my MetaMask wallet missing! Be careful when connecting your wallet to sites. Its not worth chasing coins early when you can lose all your money. Stick to the Swaps (uniswap, pancakeswap, spookyswap, etc) and don't let this happen to you!<br /><br />Just to be clear, I don't keep all my cryptocurrency in one wallet. It's not safe and what happened to me is proof that you could get everything stolen if you did that. Use multiple wallets or store your crypto in a hardwallet! <br /><br />#Hacked #Cryptocurrency #Crypto{% endraw %}
