{% raw %}Finding lasting love means finding someone who makes you happy long-term.  It sound simple, right?  It's not, especially when you analyze US divorce data.  In this talk, relationship expert Bela Gandhi teaches why successfully finding love means searching for a partner based on identifying the characteristics you need to be happy, not just the qualities we are wired to desire in a partner.  Bela shows the audience how to cleverly create the right “checklist” for finding the love of your life. Bela Gandhi has been helping people find love since college, and founded a coaching company, Smart Dating Academy to help singles everywhere. She is a media expert on dating and relationships and has spoken on the topic on local and national news and talk shows. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
