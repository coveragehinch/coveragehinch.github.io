{% raw %}Exploring new ways to window-shop, the Corning Retail Window is a concept for an interactive glass storefront that uses the sophisticated Corning glass technology to engage customers even before they enter the store. With full interactivity, the Retail Window provides product information and shopping opportunities on three levels. The first level consists of the interactive window itself, onto which a selection interface is projected. Since the transparency of the glass remains intact, visitors have a good view of the second level: the physical exhibits. An additional design element here are Corning’s light-diffusing fibers, which respond to the user’s actions on the glass interface. At the third level, a digital display shows in-depth information on the selected items. All three levels are linked and operate as one consistent system.<br /><br /><br />The Retail Window also offers additional value when not in direct use. With a multitude of animation possibilities, retailers can draw attention to sales and new products. Due to the transparent nature of the display, no real-estate in the window is lost and physical exhibits can take up the same amount of space as before.{% endraw %}
