{% raw %}yes, harder than the trials in KoF13<br /><br />Today we are continuing our playthrough of the Street Fighter 3: Third Strike combo trial challenge! Today we've got Elena, Hugo, Ibuki, Ken, and last but not least Makoto. The &quot;tominaga combo&quot; where Makoto juggles 2 uppercuts in a row after landing super is legitimately one of the hardest combos I've ever done. After 2 days of grinding I was able to pull it off 1 time, and it felt soooo good. Hope you guys enjoy! <br /><br />Twitch (I stream every weekday from 5-8 EST): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/jmcrofts">https://www.twitch.tv/jmcrofts</a><br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/jmcrofts">https://www.patreon.com/jmcrofts</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/crofts">https://twitter.com/crofts</a><br /><br />0:00 intro<br />2:50 elena<br />5:51 hugo<br />8:00 ibuki<br />10:18 ken <br />13:34 makoto{% endraw %}
