{% raw %}CHILL and allow it {Abraham Hicks 2021}<br />Abraham Hicks is a popular teacher in LOA (law of attraction) and will help you on your journey of manifesting love, money, relationships and more.<br /><br />// Subscribe for more Abraham Hicks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rb.gy/ebepnd">https://rb.gy/ebepnd</a><br /><br />// Who Is Abraham? <br />Abraham is a name. A symbol. A feeling. Abraham has described themselves as “a group consciousness from the non-physical dimension”. <br /><br />// What are the 5 steps to complete alignment and manifestation?<br /><br />Step 1: Contrast provides you with what you want.<br />Source knows your desires. Whether you have asked for them or whether you experience something negative that you don’t want (the contrast), it automatically turns into what you do want.<br /><br />Step 2: Source provides it and your higher self gathers all the cooperative components necessary for it to enter your life experience. This happens instantly. It’s all lined up and ready for you, any time.<br /><br />Step 3: Become a match to the vibration of the desire and maintain it.<br />This is usually the hardest part for people. To become a vibrational match you have to put yourself in a state of positive emotions and feelings and allow it to come to you. <br />As you learn to relax, trust the process, and flow with the natural current of energy in your life, you will be led, step by step, to the manifestation of everything that you want.<br />Alignment simply means that you enjoy the process, and appreciate the state of not having what you want as much as you appreciate the desire itself.<br /><br />These 3 steps are enough to manifest anything you desire. Steps 4 and 5 which were added later on are about learning to live in a constant state of alignment and connection with your source energy.<br /><br />Step 4: Maintain your alignment consistently<br />As you appreciate your desires more fully and relax into the process of alignment, you will find you will automatically begin to maintain your alignment more consistently, and will begin to know quickly whenever you step out of alignment. In other words, in Step 4, you shift your priority to feeling good, all of the time.<br /><br />Step 5: Appreciate the contrast<br />Lastly, Step 5 is the recognition that even your negative experiences are, in some way, supporting your growth and development. For most people, negative situations trigger negative emotions, but when you truly learn to master your energy, you can see that while you will always have new desires, preferences, and occasionally will still have complaints about your current environment, you will see even the negative aspects as a blessing.<br />When you live from Step 5, you live in a complete state of trust with the universe, you are confident that you live in an abundant world and everything is always working out for you.<br /><br />// Audio by Abraham Hicks used following the copyrighted material guidelines: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AbrahamHicks/about">https://www.youtube.com/user/AbrahamHicks/about</a><br /><br />// Check out the official website for Abraham Hicks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.abraham-hicks.com">http://www.abraham-hicks.com</a><br /><br />#Abrahamhicks #lawofattraction #abrahamhickspublication{% endraw %}
