{% raw %}Welcome to this English lesson where I'll help you learn how to describe food. If you haven't noticed, food is all around us and there is so much variety.  Describing food in English requires quite a bit of vocabulary. In this free English class I won't be teaching the names of different food as I'm sure you know most of those already, but instead I'll help you learn words and phrase that you can use to talk about those foods when you have an English conversation.<br /><br />In this English lesson you'll learn words and phrases like, crispy, crunchy, bland, undercooked, burnt, sticky, and more!<br /><br />Remember this is much more than a simple vocabulary lesson. It is important to listen to the words and phrases I use as I talk about each word as you'll be able to pick up many common English expressions along the way.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this English lesson about describing food!<br /><br />‚åõ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.  Twice today with English subtitles on, and once tomorrow with the English subtitles off.  This will reinforce the English you have learned!<br /><br />--<br /><br />‚úÖ Support Me and Get These Members Only Perks:<br />üòÄüí≤ If you would like to become a member of my channel here is the link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join</a><br /><br />Becoming a member at every level has these benefits and perks:<br />1) For 10 minutes or more at the end of each live stream you will be able to participate in the &quot;Members Only&quot; chat.<br />2) A cool crown beside your name during live streams and when making comments on videos.<br />3) Your name in green during live stream lesson chat.<br />4) You will have access to a members only video each Wednesday called, &quot;Wednesdays with Bob&quot;.
