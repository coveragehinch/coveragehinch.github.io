{% raw %}This video establishes that timing of food intake is a modifiable risk factor that has an influence on energy regulation and the risk of obesity. It explains how our bodies are complex organisms regulated by a number of biological clocks that influence bodily functions. It then describes how timing of food intake can act as an external synchronizer of these systems and how dysregulation can lead to the development of disease as well as disruptions of different physiological variables. Most commonly observed in those who skip breakfast is the development of obesity, which is thought to be due to greater caloric intake during the evening hours and increased fat storage. Finally, the video explores different diets and their effect on nutrient consumption as it relates to current scientific literature.<br /><br />Rationale/Goal: Many students find themselves leaving important meals out of their day. Students are faced with an increasing number of tasks to complete within a limited period of time that require considerable resources and energy. In addition, students entering university or college may need to make thier own meals as well as do other tasks as they experience independence for the first time. Therefore, this video discusses the significance of timing on food intake and why it should be an important consideration for the health and overall success of the university student.<br /><br />This video was created by McMaster Demystifying Medicine students Kaitlin Marshall, Peter Malik, Ubaid Mohammad and Merima Menzildzic<br /><br />Copyright McMaster University 2017<br /><br />References:<br /><br />1.
