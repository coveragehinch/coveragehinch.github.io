{% raw %}Imagine getting scared by normal stuff as a kid!? back in my day we shivered at the thought of evil Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle with hyper realistic eyes. My Little Pony might've been a kids show but man did people like to do some spooky stuff with it. That's what me and @Raymundo 2112 talk about in this years Halloween special. <br /><br /><br />Raymundo 2112 channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaBOxNaxxlnFV1Ls8as1HWg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaBOxNaxxlnFV1Ls8as1HWg</a><br />Intro animation by Lightning Leaf<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/fBf792Al2Dc">https://youtu.be/fBf792Al2Dc</a> <br />Shunk Shack Discord Server:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/dgvuVuzxaC">https://discord.gg/dgvuVuzxaC</a> <br />Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/shunks">https://www.patreon.com/shunks</a><br />TikTok:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@_shunks_?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@_shunks_?lang=en</a> <br />Instagram:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shunksinreal/">https://www.instagram.com/shunksinreal/</a> <br />Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/_Shunks_">https://twitter.com/_Shunks_</a><br /><br />Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
