Then Saul would become refreshed and well, and the distressing spirit would depart from him&quot;). My music is Anointed, Inspirational and God inspired; it's an overflow of time spent in God's presence and fellowship with the Holy Spirit. I pray you will be drawn to the love of God in Christ Jesus, you will experience a peace that pass all understanding, you will experience healing from your sickness, and May the peace of God which surpasses all understanding guard your heart and mind as you listen. Amen!<br />..............................................................................<br />You can support this ministry by donating here: <br />PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/DTKPaypal">https://bit.ly/DTKPaypal</a><br />Cash App: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/DTKCashapp">https://bit.ly/DTKCashapp</a>{% endraw %}
