{% raw %}This video is all about helping kids learn about recycling. Recycling is taking used materials and waste and then turning it into new, useful products. Recycling waste into new products reduces the amount of materials that would have been needed if the product had to be made all over again and is very beneficial for the planet! <br /><br />In addition, we teach kids how to reduce, reuse, and recycle and give them real life applications so each child can start today.  After completing this video and finishing the FREE Recycling lesson plan (link below) your student(s) will be able to define recycling, identify common items that are recycled, and list the three steps to successful recycling.  We hope you and your children have fun learning about Recycling and keeping our planet clean.<br /><br />Link to Lesson plan (Grades 1-3): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://learnbright.org/lessons/science/recycling/">https://learnbright.org/lessons/science/recycling/</a><br /><br />Thank you for watching!
