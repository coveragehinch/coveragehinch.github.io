{% raw %}You don’t have to be intimidated by trouble and trials any longer; God is right there with you through any challenge. His favor is going to make things happen that you didn’t see coming.<br /><br />It’s easy to believe we have favor when good things are happening, but Joel wants to show you how we have favor even in the challenge. God will cause you to succeed in the middle of trouble. He’s not limited by our conditions; He’s limited by our thinking. When you believe, all things are possible.<br /><br />This is message #757, &quot;Favor in the Storm&quot;, by Joel Osteen.
