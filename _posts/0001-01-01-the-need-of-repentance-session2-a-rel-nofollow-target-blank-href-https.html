That is the order of the day, no matter how perfect we think we are, there is a need for repentance. I am seeking the face of the Most High for an extraordinary portion of repentance that will cleanse my soul to the utmost. I want to hear His voice, I want to know when and where to exit, I need to be clean when He gets ready to take us out. There is a need for total repentance!{% endraw %}
