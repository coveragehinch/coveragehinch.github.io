{% raw %}In this episode of @Craft &amp; Tailored 's Under The Radar Tyler talks about a sleeper Wakmann triple calendar chronograph. The Wakmann triple calendar chronograph leverages a Valjoux cal. 730 which is based around the Valjoux cal. 72C which can be found in some heavy hitters like the Rolex &quot;Jean-Claude Killy&quot;  Ref. 6236. The reason why the Wakmann triple calendar chronograph flys &quot;Under The Radar&quot; is that it possesses complications and thoughtful vintage design without the price tag usually associated with similar triple calendar chronographs from the same era. These Wakmann triple calendar chronographs have already started to creep up in price, follow along as Tyler takes us through this Under The Radar gem!<br /><br />///<br /><br />#Wakmanntriplecalendar #triplecalendar #craftandtailored<br /><br />///<br /><br />Explore Wakmann Via The C+T Shop <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.craftandtailored.com/search?type=product&amp;q=wakmann">https://www.craftandtailored.com/search?type=product&amp;q=wakmann</a><br /><br />///<br />Craft + Tailored<br />Web:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.craftandtailored.com/">https://www.craftandtailored.com/</a><br />Questions:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.craftandtailored.com/contact-la-vintage-watches/">https://blog.craftandtailored.com/contact-la-vintage-watches/</a><br />IG:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/craftandtailored/">https://www.instagram.com/craftandtailored/</a>{% endraw %}
