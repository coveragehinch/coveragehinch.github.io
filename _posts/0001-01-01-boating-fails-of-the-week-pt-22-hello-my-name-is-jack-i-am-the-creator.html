{% raw %}Hello my name is Jack i am the creator of Full Throttle Edits and i would like to welcome you to Full Throttle Edits where we create the wildest off-road content around from dirt bikes to atvs to side by sides to trucks, boats and jetskis too! All boating content has commentary to teach you the correct and most safe way to operate a boat or personal watercraft. Within our content i specifically focused on teaching you the proper way to ride these machines while avoiding injury. We put many hours into these videos and were always looking for advice on what to change. There are many different things that you will learn from our videos but i think the most important is to wear a helmet. Often we see many people not riding with helmets on and once they have a fall it is very dangerous for them, so in that case always wear a helmet and ride according to your local laws but always have fun! Have a suggestion for a video? Feel free to send us a Dm on any of our social medias or feel free to comment below. Thanks for checking out the channel and as always we hope you enjoy and stayed tuned for more awesome uploads!<br /><br />‚ÄúCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for ‚Äúfair use‚Äù for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
