{% raw %}You know the feeling you get when you are watching some particularly scary videos — that prickling on the back of your neck and the swooping sensation in your abdomen? More often than not, in those moments, you will find yourself holding your breath as the dread of the horror simply becomes too much for you to handle. The videos that I have analyzed for you here will make you go through all that and much more — in fact, these are scary videos you can't unsee, no matter how bad you wish you could.<br /> <br />This list of creepy videos will have no trouble prodding and poking at your deepest fears. From ghost encounters and eerie happenings caught on cam in a haunted house to terrifying paranormal incidents, this list of top 15 scary videos will make your inner self scream and your soul shiver. Now, being a horror fan, you may think you will love every second of watching this list of creepy videos. But the truth is that you won't. Rather, you are going to find yourself dazed and stunned by a fear that sends chills up your spine and may very well keep you up at night for weeks to come!<br /> <br />In their own right, these scary videos are enough to break you into a cold sweat. The lingering fear they will leave you with could most assuredly crumble your sense of what's real and what's not — and with that, when things go bump in the night, you will know exactly why the entries of this list are seen as some of the scariest videos around.<br /> <br />Sometimes, people watch creepy videos to develop their confidence or to prove to others that they can endure spine-chilling frights. While that is usually a good way to go about it, don't look at this scary comp as an opportunity to face your fears — because these creepy videos may scare you so badly, your plan may backfire, especially if you get frightened easily.<br /> <br />Know what’s coming your way before watching these creepy videos. No amount of scary stories you may have read will make for enough preparation to go through these scary videos unscathed. My advice? Buddy up! If you watch this list of creepy videos with your friends, it can help you feel tethered to reality — making you feel safer. I used to do it too. Scary videos seem less frightening when you aren't alone. Still, if at any point you feel overwhelmed with fear, remember that there’s no shame in turning your head away or squeezing your eyes shut in the face of nerve-wracking horror!<br /> <br />Done watching?
