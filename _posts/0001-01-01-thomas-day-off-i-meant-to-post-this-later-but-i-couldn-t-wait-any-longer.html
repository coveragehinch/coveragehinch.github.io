{% raw %}I meant to post this later, but I couldn't wait any longer! I've thought up of a game to search for someplace for Thomas to sleep.<br /><br />Story: Thomas has been working all night and is feeling incredibly tired. So Sir Topham Hatt tells Thomas that he deserves a day off. Thomas goes to sleep in the shed (Toby just happened to be there sleeping before he starts the day). And that's where the trouble starts.<br /><br />In the end, you decide where Thomas goes to sleep on Sodor. More events of this game is to come, including a very special guess star!<br /><br />1. Peanut-Butter Jelly Time!<br />2. Shipoopi (Family Guy)<br />3. Fresh Prince of Bel-Air<br />4. Johnny Bravo<br />5. Darkwing Duck<br />6. Kennan and Kel<br />7. Po Pi Po (Hatsune Miku)<br />8. Mr. Belvedere{% endraw %}
