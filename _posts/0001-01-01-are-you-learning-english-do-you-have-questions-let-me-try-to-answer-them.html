{% raw %}Every week I look forward to doing a live English lesson outside. This week though the weather is a little iffy.  Iffy means that the weather at this time of year is unpredictable. That means I won't know until just before the lesson whether it is nice enough outside to do the lesson under my tree or if I'll need to be inside.<br /><br />Either way, there is going to be an English lesson!  This is a great time to submit a question about the English language and I will do my best to answer it. As a native English speaker I always enjoy the questions that everyone asks during these sessions. It helps me remember that English is very intricate. It is a complicated and beautiful language. Some parts of it are easy to learn and some parts are a mystery!<br /><br />Often even I'm surprised at how complex the English language can be, and I imagine for an English student this comes as no surprise. I promise to do my best to answer your questions in a clear and concise way to help you continue to make progress as you learn English.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this English question and answer lesson!<br /><br />This English lesson is from October 23 2021.<br /><br />âŒ› Remember:  Always watch the video three times.  Twice today with English subtitles on, and once tomorrow with the English subtitles off.  This will reinforce the English you have learned!<br /><br />--<br /><br />âœ… Support Me and Get These Members Only Perks:<br />ðŸ˜€ðŸ’² If you would like to become a member of my channel here is the link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join</a><br /><br />Becoming a member at every level has these benefits and perks:<br />1) For 10 minutes or more at the end of each live stream you will be able to participate in the &quot;Members Only&quot; chat.<br />2) A cool crown beside your name during live streams and when making comments on videos.<br />3) Your name in green during live stream lesson chat.<br />4) You will have access to a members only video each Wednesday called, &quot;Wednesdays with Bob&quot;.
