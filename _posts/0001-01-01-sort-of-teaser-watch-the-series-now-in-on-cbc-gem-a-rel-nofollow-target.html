When Sabi’s best friend 7ven (Amanda Cordner) presents them with an opportunity to live and find themself in the &quot;queerest place in the galaxy,&quot; Sabi instead makes the decision to stay and care for the kids they nanny after their mom has a serious bike accident. <br /><br />Do they regret it? Sort of. A coming-of-age story, Sort Of is a show about how each and every one of us is in transition.<br /><br />#sortof #bilalbaig #cbc<br /><br />Subscribe for more comedy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/subscribeCBCcomedy">http://bit.ly/subscribeCBCcomedy</a><br /><br />Follow CBC Comedy:<br />On Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/CBCComedy">http://www.twitter.com/CBCComedy</a><br />On Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/cbccomedy">http://www.facebook.com/cbccomedy</a><br />On Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/cbccomedy">http://www.instagram.com/cbccomedy</a><br /><br />CBC Comedy is your destination for funny Canadian comedy and comedians in Canada, clips from TV shows like Schitt's Creek, Workin' Moms, Baroness von Sketch, Tallboyz and more!{% endraw %}
