{% raw %}I went to see the doc<br />When the school bell rang<br />My mind’s all ablur<br />Can’t focus on anything<br /><br />She said not to stress<br />All the kids go through this<br />She opened my hand<br />And gave me an Adderall<br /><br />And it gives me high<br />All the time<br />But not the high<br />That eases my mind<br /><br />When i walk the halls<br />And somebody calls<br />I hear their voice<br />But it all sounds like noise<br /><br />My brain’s on Addreall<br />When it keeps me high<br />All the time<br />I wanna fly<br />But my brain’s on Adderall<br />Oh, oh<br />My brain’s on Adderall{% endraw %}
