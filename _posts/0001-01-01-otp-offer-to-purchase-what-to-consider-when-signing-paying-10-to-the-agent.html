{% raw %}The OTP is the first major document you will sign when buying property and you should not undermine this step! This document can ruin things for you, so read it carefully before signing. When applying for your home loan the bank will also asked for a signed OTP with the signatures of all parties involved mainly you and the seller/s. <br /><br />Please share your experience with us in the comments section.<br />Catch me on Instagram on @FinancialChats_ Tisa{% endraw %}
