{% raw %}This is a video about MesoAmerican myths that are similar to Abrahamic religious stories. For the complete videos of worldwide mythologies kindly go to the Playlist marked as World Mythologies. For the complete religious comparison study kindly visit: www.mythoreligio.com.<br /><br />00:00 Theme Song<br />00:22 Intro<br />03:10 MesoAmerican mythologies<br /><br />MythoReligio is a series of books about religious comparison studies between Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and world mythologies. The purpose is to retrace the (pre)history of humanity since the author (Indy Jane - pseudo name) is not fully satisfied with either the explanations from the point of view of creationists nor evolutionists.<br /><br />In this book series you will also learn about the (pre)history of humanity from the modern scientific point of view and other alternative theories. <br /><br />After thorough research of ca. 30 years, the author recognizes many, many similarities between all religious stories and even mythologies and surprisingly some of them are in accordance or even beyond modern science that have been proven as correct; and concluded that ALL religions must have come from the same Source and these stories (although heavily jumbled up) are actually telling one Mega Story - the true (pre)history of our common ancestors.<br /><br />This story is quite different than what we have been told to believe and will truly blow your mind as it is more fascinating than our imagination. These videos are part of this book series... for deeper analysis that leads to the above conclusion kindly read the books that are available in Ebook format sold in the above-mentioned website or the physical books at Amazon.com in color or black/white version.<br /><br />Music Credit:<br />“Embrace” by Sappheiros<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/sappheirosmusic">https://soundcloud.com/sappheirosmusic</a><br />Pan Pipes Music (No Copyright Free Music) #Relaxmusic#panpipesmusic#<br />Relaxing Music<br />Pan Pipes Music (No Copyright Free Music) #Relaxmusic#panpipesmusic# - YouTube{% endraw %}
