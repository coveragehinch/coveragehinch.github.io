I've lived debt-free for over 15 years, developed five steady streams of revenue, and have a six-figure network by utilizing financial management as a tool to build my best life. <br /><br />My advice is based on what has worked for me but I fully acknowledge that it will not work for everyone due to the systemic oppression and disenfranchisement that keeps people from attaining financial health.{% endraw %}
