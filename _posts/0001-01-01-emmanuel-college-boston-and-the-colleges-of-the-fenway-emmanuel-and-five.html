{% raw %}Emmanuel and five of its neighboring colleges — Massachusetts College of Art, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Simmons College, Wentworth Institute of Technology and Wheelock College — have joined in the Colleges of the Fenway (COF) collaboration. The collaboration benefits students by offering cross-registration, at no additional cost, to any COF institution.<br /><br /><br /><br />In addition, students benefit from common social events and access to the academic resources and services of all six institutions. Emmanuel students enjoy all the benefits of a small college environment, while having access to the resources of a large university. Collectively, the colleges represent more than 11,400 undergraduate students, comprising 16.2% of the total Boston population of undergraduates attending four-year colleges, more than 700 full-time faculty and 2,300 course offerings.{% endraw %}
