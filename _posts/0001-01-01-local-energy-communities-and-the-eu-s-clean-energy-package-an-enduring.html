{% raw %}Speakers: Jake Barnes (The Newcomers Project, Environmental Change Institute, Oxford); Jenny Palm (International Institute of Industrial Environmental Economics, Lund University)<br />Discussant: Kristian Petrick (Prosumers for the Energy Union (PROSEU))<br /><br />Chair: Kalypso Nicolaidis (St Antony’s College, Oxford; School of Transnational Governance, European University Institute)<br /><br />This online event features as one of several this term which focusses on 'Political economy of European climate action', and is hosted by the European Political Economy Project (EUPEP) at the European Studies Centre.<br /><br />Abstract: The EU's Clean Energy Package (CEP), finalised in 2019, introduced the concept of 'energy communities' and enshrined the rights of individuals and communities to generate, store and sell energy. For many this has been hailed as a significant moment. But to what extent does this move open the way for new entrants to potentially disrupt European energy markets, or does it simply reflect a convergence of commercial and political interest within increasingly renewable, decentralised and digitalised energy systems?  After introducing the CEP and contemporary activity by energy communities, the seminar will discuss the reaction of governments, the energy industry and civil society to the new rights of enshrined within the CEP and outline a series of critical issues that are likely to determine the CEP’s and energy communities disruptive potential.{% endraw %}
