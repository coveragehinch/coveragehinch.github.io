{% raw %}This is not a tutorial. It is more of a daily personal diary, or perhaps a vlog, centered around the building of plastic model ships. Don’t be surprised when I unexpectedly, but usually just momentarily, get into something completely unrelated.<br />I was big into building models years ago. Apparently I’m trying to bring back “the good old days” by building plastic model ships. In this series I’ve already built Trumpeter’s 1/200 scale battleship Bismarck and a very large model ship case that will hold three ( maybe four) 1/200 scale ships. Now we are building Trumpeter’s 1/200 scale HMS Hood. I now have on hand Trumpeter’s 1/200 scale HMS Rodney, and it is my intent to start on it as soon as the Hood is finished.<br />Feel free to learn from my mistakes.{% endraw %}
