{% raw %}Scientific name - Cavia porcellus (Lat.), Where porcellus Latin means &quot;little pig&quot; and savia - novolatinsky term derived from sabiai, the animal's name in the language of Ghalib tribes that existed in the territory of French Guiana (location with in South America.). Breeders usually use more formal name Cavy (KEVI or cave, cut. lat.), while the widespread name guinea pig. In Russia, the animals are called &quot;guinea pig.&quot; The name supposedly borrowed from the Polish świnka morska, and Polish - from the German Meerschweinchen, which literally means &quot;guinea pig.&quot;<br /><br />Guinea pig stable.jpg<br />Comparison of pigs from pig is not entirely clear. Perhaps due to the characteristic sounds made by animals, as well as the proportions of the head to the body, thick neck and a lack of waist. Also, they always eat and can live in small zagonchik, which are usually used on ships for pigs. At home guinea pigs local Indian tribes used them for food. Currently, almost everywhere in South America use guinea pigs for food (for example, only in Peru, about 65 million animals a year). The taste and nutritional value of the meat of guinea pigs close to the rabbit and chicken, that is diet.<br /><br />The name of this animal in most languages ​​refers to the pig. For example, the French cochon d'Inde (Indian pig), in Dutch Guinees biggetje (guinea pig), Portuguese porquinho da Índia (little Indian pig), the Chinese 荷蘭 豬 hélánzhū (Dutch pig). But there is a connection with the other animals, for example, in Japanese モ ル モ ッ ト (morumotto) from the English word marmot (groundhog); Spanish conejillo de Indias (little rabbit from the East Indies); in one of the dialects of German as a merswin (dolphin) (more merswin = Meerschweinchen), apparently issued for the similarity of sounds.{% endraw %}
