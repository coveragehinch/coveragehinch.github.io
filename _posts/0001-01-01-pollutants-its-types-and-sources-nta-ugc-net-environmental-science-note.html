{% raw %}Note- The speed of the video is increased by 1.25x as this is a very easy topic to understand and was a bit longer when recorded. I hope you do not mind a little cartoonised voice.<br /><br />In this video I will be discussing about pollutants, its types, sources and severity. This will be covered in the following sections <br />1) Pollutants - Definition<br />2) Sources - Natural and Man Made<br />3) Point or Non Point sources<br />4) Primary and Secondary Pollutants<br />5) Biodegradable and Non Biodegradable Pollutants<br />6) Factors affecting Severity of Pollutants<br />This video will be helpful for those preparing for any competitive exam especially for NTA UGC NET [Paper 2 (EVS) and Paper 1(People, Development and Environment)]. <br />.<br />.<br />You can also watch other videos on the channel :<br /> Plume Behavior Part 1(in English) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTkeycQPVAU&amp;t=6s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTkeycQPVAU&amp;t=6s</a><br />Criteria Pollutants - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q_wlPQ9GdI&amp;t=11s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q_wlPQ9GdI&amp;t=11s</a> <br />Plume Behavior Part 1(in Hindi) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqrpV07ihaY&amp;t=21s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqrpV07ihaY&amp;t=21s</a><br />Preparation Strategy for NTA UGC NET- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHwVo3ua6Fs&amp;t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHwVo3ua6Fs&amp;t=2s</a><br />Plume Behavior Part 2 (in English)- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo16dVe3O0o&amp;t=30s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo16dVe3O0o&amp;t=30s</a><br />.<br />Also follow the page on Instagram and solve the question and Answers related to the topics you learnt in the videos -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/facilitate_to_educate/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/facilitate_to_educate/?hl=en</a><br />.<br />.<br />#pollutants #ntanet #facilitatetoeducate #environmentalscience #evs #typesofpollutants #sourcesofpollutants{% endraw %}
