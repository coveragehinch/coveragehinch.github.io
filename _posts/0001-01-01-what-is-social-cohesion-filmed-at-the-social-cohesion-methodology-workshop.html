{% raw %}Filmed at the Social Cohesion methodology workshop, at German Development Institute, Bonn, in August 2019.<br />Inequalities around the world, political polarization and persisting violent conflicts have triggered an increasing interest in social cohesion. In reaction to these trends, an increasing number of projects in development cooperation aim to improve social cohesion. However, many questions remain on what actually makes societies stick together and how development cooperation can contribute to improving social cohesion in highly diverse settings. In order to foster an international dialogue on the topic, the workshop brings together a variety of different perspectives on social cohesion in development policy – efforts to conceptualize and measure social cohesion, project implementation and different theories of change as well as strategy development. German Development Institute (DEI) organised a two day workshop titled: Contributing to Social Cohesion Through Development Cooperation – Trends, Approaches and Challenges. The workshop aimed to enable in-depth exchange on the topic, identify commonalities and challenges related to understanding and promoting social cohesion and learn from each other’s experiences. The workshop was organized on behalf of DIE’s research project “Social cohesion in Africa&quot;, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). It comprises a team of researchers who are measuring social cohesion in order to identify different patterns of social cohesion in African societies and conduct research on driving factors of social cohesion.{% endraw %}
