{% raw %}A university professor natured in the untold gender and feminine drama of religious history challenges us to return to defining the power of religious and spiritual forces in our lives instead of letting the cultural boxes limit our capacity for growth and spiritual innovation.<br /><br />Dr. Carol Anderson is an eye-opening marketer for those stories of religious history which often go unseen. Rooted as chair of the Department of Religion at Kalamazoo College, Carol's work travels in the Asiatic hemisphere and focuses on dynamic feminine and gender realities. She currently explores the history of sex-change in Buddhist monks and nuns in the Pali Buddhist canon while encouraging her university students to wrestle with life's big questions one conversation at a time.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
