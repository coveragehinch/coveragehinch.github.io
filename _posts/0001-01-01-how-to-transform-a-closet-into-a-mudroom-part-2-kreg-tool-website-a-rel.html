Our laundry room has this large closet as you walk in the house that we thought would be an excellent place to build in a bench and shoe storage to keep everything in order.<br /><br />This video is part 2 of a 2-part series detailing our journey of transforming a plain 90's-era closet into a modern functional mudroom bench setup.<br /><br />We continue the build by making the butcher block bench seat and face frame.  Once those are done we can move onto the back panel which will eventually have some hooks for coats and a small upper shelf for (mostly) decoration.<br /><br />In parallel I also created a series of floating shelves in the corner of the closet to best utilize the space.  I created these shelves from some off-cuts of the butcher block and routed a channel on 2 sides to accept a &quot;cleat&quot; which I mounted to the wall.<br /><br />The most time-intensive step of this project by far is prepping and applying finish.  All of the brad nail holes had to be plugged and sanded then all of the gaps caulked and smoothed.  ONLY THEN can we actually start painting.  I eventually applied 3 coats of paint to everything to get a consistent color.  Oh and we also applied wallpaper!<br /><br />Great video showing how to apply the wallpaper - <br /><br />Overall this project turned out great and was well worth the effort.  I hope you enjoy!<br /><br />Links to Build Supplies (affiliate links help sponsor the content!):<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Herringbone Wallpaper - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3G4vKNN">https://amzn.to/3G4vKNN</a><br />75 lb capacity wall anchors - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ngYXw6">https://amzn.to/3ngYXw6</a><br />Incra T-Rule (6-inch) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3A42AeN">https://amzn.to/3A42AeN</a><br />Woodpeckers T-Squares - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3x7BXDF">https://bit.ly/3x7BXDF</a><br />Pentel Mechanical Pencils - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CEoK7x">https://amzn.to/3CEoK7x</a><br />3D Printed Fenceless Stop Block - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://etsy.me/2SjN5OI">https://etsy.me/2SjN5OI</a><br /><br />Shop Nation Links:<br />---------------------------------------------------- <br />Shop Nation Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shop-nation.com/​">https://www.shop-nation.com/​</a> <br />Products, Plans, and Stickers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/ShopNationStore">https://www.etsy.com/shop/ShopNationStore</a><br />Instagram (@dreamshopnation): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dreamshopnation">https://www.instagram.com/dreamshopnation</a><br />Shop Nation T-shirts! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop-nation-gear.creator-spring.com">https://shop-nation-gear.creator-spring.com</a><br /><br />This video is sponsored by Kreg Tool.{% endraw %}
