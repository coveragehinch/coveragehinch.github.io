His mother teaches him the 4 step method in apologizing. <br /><br />Zach identifies:<br />1.  What I did to hurt somebody<br />2.  How the person felt<br />3.  What I do next time<br />4.  How I'll make it up to the person<br /><br />Zach mother's ensures that Zach understands that while he made a mistake, he is not a bad person.  Zach finds comfort in his ability to take ownership over the situation and try to resolve the conflict in a positive way.<br /><br />Frustration can manifest in ways that are unhealthy and hurtful. Teaching kids the power of the apology is critical in helping them build strong relationships based on respect and effective communication.<br /><br />Social Emotional Learning is empowering for children and adults. As described by The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), &quot;Social and emotional learning (SEL) is the process through which children and adults acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Research confirms and teachers, parents, and principals agree: Social and emotional competencies can be taught, modeled, and practiced and lead to positive student outcomes that are important for success in school and in life.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Decades of research studies demonstrate the following benefits of SEL: <br />-Improvement in students’ social and emotional skills, attitudes, relationships, academic performance, and perceptions of classroom and school climate<br />-Decline in students’ anxiety, behavior problems, and substance use<br />-Long-term improvements in students’ skills, attitudes, prosocial behavior, and academic performance<br />-Wise financial investment according to cost-benefit research&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Social and emotional learning (SEL) is an integral part of education and human development. SEL is the process through which all young people and adults acquire and apply the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to develop healthy identities, manage emotions and achieve personal and collective goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain supportive relationships, and make responsible and caring decisions.<br />SEL advances educational equity and excellence through authentic school-family-community partnerships to establish learning environments and experiences that feature trusting and collaborative relationships, rigorous and meaningful curriculum and instruction, and ongoing evaluation. SEL can help address various forms of inequity and empower young people and adults to co-create thriving schools and contribute to safe, healthy, and just communities.&quot; Quoted by The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL)<br /><br />&quot;The CASEL 5 addresses five broad and interrelated areas of competence and highlights examples for each: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making. The CASEL 5 can be taught and applied at various developmental stages from childhood to adulthood and across diverse cultural contexts. Many school districts, states, and countries have used the CASEL 5 to establish preschool to high school learning standards and competencies that articulate what students should know and be able to do for academic success, school and civic engagement, health and wellness, and fulfilling careers.&quot;<br /><br />SEL can have a great impact on many aspects of our lives. It is our hope that Annie &amp; Rocco can help children engage in this type of learning throughout their early education studies and incorporate this understanding in all aspects of their lives.  <br />_____<br /><br />Many parents and teachers may not be able to find the time to read to children.  Annie &amp; Rocco are here to help!  Children view the book in its original form and listen to the expressive sharing of stories and picture books.
