So here are a few of our top tips where (and what) to eat whilst in Cyprus. For breakfast, grab something fast and delicious to take on the road. Thereâ€™s so much to see, and not a second to waste! The bakeries here are incredible, everythingâ€™s freshly baked and huge! Perfect car snacks, along with great coffee to go. Mini pizzas, savoury pies or perhaps youâ€™d prefer to indulge your sweet tooth with the fabulous biscuits and pastries on offer... fruit filled to the classic, decadent baklava... heaven! For lunch, make it a stop on your adventure, and take the chance to go somewhere with character. Our tip for finding the best food - look for locally owned taverna style restaurants, and youâ€™ll definitely be onto a good thing! Theyâ€™re more likely to serve traditional food and purchase locally sourced ingredients, putting your money back into the local economy. We had a great lunch at Oniro By The Sea, a taverna looking onto a shipwreck. It has traditional food on the menu but also safe bets like burgers - if youâ€™re travelling with the family. For dinner? Give yourself a chance to wind down... and take the best shortcut EVER to trying loads of different kinds of Cypriot cuisine, by ordering a mezze! Where youâ€™ll get a selection of smaller dishes. So weâ€™ve found a restaurant along the seafront and weâ€™ve ordered mezze. And I love ordering mezze because it means youâ€™re going to get loads of different flavours from the Cypriot menu. Here weâ€™ve got the salad, weâ€™ve got their traditional bread which has cinnamon in it, got some tzatziki, aubergine dip, obviously halloumi, and thereâ€™s gonna be more and more coming. Apparently weâ€™ve got 20 dishes to try, so Iâ€™m going to get stuck in! Have you got a favourite Cypriot dish, or place to eat? Let us know in the comments below!
