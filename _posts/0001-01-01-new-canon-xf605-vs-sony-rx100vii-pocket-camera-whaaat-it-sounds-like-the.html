{% raw %}It sounds like the craziest duel ever, but a tiny pocket camera vs a &quot;broadcast quality&quot; camcorder? I figured why not. Heck they both have 1&quot; sensors. Yes I pitted my tiny Sony RX100vii compact pocket camera against the all new $4,500 Broadcast quality Canon XF605 camcorder. It sounds insane but this David vs. Goliath will surprise you! Welcome to the channel of crazy stuff.<br />By the way- the shots of the two cameras against white were filmed by a second RX100vii in just 1080p !! Look how smooth the shots are. It was handheld. Simply amazing.<br />My recent October 2021video on the Sony RX100vii pocket camera <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0_5lQpXmyLg">https://youtu.be/0_5lQpXmyLg</a><br />My first 2020 RX100vii video <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/bNk1XP2DQLU">https://youtu.be/bNk1XP2DQLU</a><br />Where to get one (I have no affiliation) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1496248-REG/sony_dscrx100m7_b_cyber_shot_dsc_rx100_vii_digital.html">https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1496248-REG/sony_dscrx100m7_b_cyber_shot_dsc_rx100_vii_digital.html</a><br />Canon XF605 pro camcorder <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1659385-REG/canon_xf605_4k_pro_camcorder.html">https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1659385-REG/canon_xf605_4k_pro_camcorder.html</a>{% endraw %}
