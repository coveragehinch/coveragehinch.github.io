{% raw %}My favorite off-road clips of the year so far, all from January 2021 - all in my 2000 Ford Excursion XLT 4x4 V10 with a 5 inch Rough Country lift on 37 Milestar Patagonia tires and a Flowmaster exhaust /w cat delete.<br /><br />All clips were filmed in Oregon's Tillamook Forest in the Roger's Camp and Brown's Camp OHV areas. University Firepower, Powerline Trail, Bates Road<br /><br />Lots of mud, water, hills and all kinds of slippery surfaces. I love this tank and it always amazes me what my daily driver can do off road. No, it is not a diesel, but I don't tow.<br /><br />This compilation focuses more on wins and action, I plan on making another one on fails soon. Also another compilation of other vehicles in the Tillamook OHV areas (Jeep, Toyota Tacoma, Honda CRV, Chevrolet Silverado, GMC S10 and other pick up trucks) is coming up soon, stay tuned!<br /><br />Ford Excursion Gets Stuck in Snow + Tacoma Off Road Recovery<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EXk9XUnHKos">https://youtu.be/EXk9XUnHKos</a><br /><br />My favorite Excursion Off Road Moments Of 2020<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ShrgEtEU5RQ">https://youtu.be/ShrgEtEU5RQ</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/drivewithvalerian">https://www.facebook.com/groups/drivewithvalerian</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/drivewithvalerian/">https://www.instagram.com/drivewithvalerian/</a><br /><br />Like, Share, Subscribe and Comment!{% endraw %}
