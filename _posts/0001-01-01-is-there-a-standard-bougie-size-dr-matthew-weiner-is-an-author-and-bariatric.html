His practice is located in Tucson Arizona. <br /><br />Dr. Weiner graduated from the University of Michigan medical school in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He completed his general surgery residency at New York University Hospital in New York City. He practiced in suburban Detroit for 12 years before moving to Tucson in 2019 where he, together with Dr. Guillermo Higa, founded Tucson Weight Loss Surgery. <br /><br />In addition to his surgical practice, Dr. Weiner is the Director of Bariatric Surgery and the Medical Director of Telemedicine at Tucson Medical Center.

He also performs general surgery with an interest in stomach and small intestine surgery along with complex hernia repair.  <br /><br />In his first book, A Pound of Cure, Dr. Weiner debunks the traditional understanding of calorie balance driving weight loss and offers a non-surgical solution to those suffering from obesity through nutritional stability.<br /><br />His second book, How Weight Loss Surgery Really Works: And How to Make it Work for You, is now available on Amazon in paperback and kindle. In this book, Dr. Weiner describes how the hormonal changes that alter your brain, fat stores and hunger signals are the most important component of weight loss surgery, rather than the portion control effects that have been emphasized in the past.<br /><br />His third publication called The Bariatric Diet Guide and Cookbook is a cookbook for bariatric patients that offers recipes and guidance on the most effective post-surgical diet. <br /><br />On his website, www.poundofcureweightloss.com, he offers more than 150 videos on a wide array of nutritional and bariatric topics. Lesson plans range from, “Preparing for Weight Loss Surgery” to “The Metabolic Reset Diet” including recipes and meal plans.<br /><br />Dr. Weiner is licensed to practice in both Arizona and Michigan and even offers Telemedicine appointments.
