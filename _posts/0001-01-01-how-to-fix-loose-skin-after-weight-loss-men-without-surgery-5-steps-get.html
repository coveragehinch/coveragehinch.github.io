I have 4 other solutions you should try before you even think about letting a surgeon near you.<br /><br />Here are my 4 remedies for loose skin after weight loss before surgery should be an option.<br /><br />Step #1: Build More Muscle<br /><br />Now that you've lost a lot of body fat, you have ended up with space on your frame and inside your skin, which is causing it to be loose.<br /><br />My recommendation is to clean bulk muscle tissue (increasing muscle without adding fat) to fill up the space, improve your body shape, and help tighten up your loose skin.<br /><br />More muscle mass will also ignite your metabolism and help with another one of my recommendations further down, of continuing to lose body fat. Two birds with one stone! Win-Win!!<br /><br />Step #2: Protect your skin &amp; Supplement with collagen<br /><br />Protecting your skin from things that will damage its elasticity is the first stage of this step. <br /><br />Quitting smoking, avoiding UV rays without sunscreen, and avoiding too much chlorine or other chemicals on your skin will help.<br /><br />Daily moisturizing or a similar skincare routine maybe isn't what you're used to, but if you're open to loose skin after weight loss remedies, this could be the change you need to make.<br /><br />Also, because a lot of loose skin after weight loss over 50 is caused by decreasing collagen production in your body, supplementing with collagen would definitely be beneficial.<br /><br />My personal recommendation is Great Lakes Collagen, which you can find at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://greatlakesgelatin.com/storefront/">https://greatlakesgelatin.com/storefront/</a><br /><br />Step #3: Continue decreasing body-fat (to 10-12%)<br /><br />If you've been using the Fit Father Project programs to lose weight, you'll know the overwhelming benefits that come with reduced weight and body fat.<br /><br />For that sake, continuing to lose body fat, down to a level of around 10-12%, will help you see whether any more invasive next steps are needed.<br /><br />If you still have loose skin after you have got down to such a low percentage, you may need to decide whether you are happy as you are, or whether my last 2 solutions are needed.<br /><br />Step #4: Non-invasive medical procedures (Fraxel lasers/radio frequency skin tightening) <br /><br />Non-invasive procedures, such as Fraxel lasers or radio frequency skin tightening machines could be the next step you need to take if the previous 3 options haven't had the desired effect.<br /><br />Radio frequency machines are freely available from beauty stores, Amazon or eBay. Sessions are also likely available at beauty centers and medical centers in your local area.<br /><br />Fraxel lasers are also available, but I would suggest having this done by a professional at a reputable clinic.<br /><br />If you have health care insurance, it would be worth checking out whether these types of treatments are covered.<br /><br />Step #5 &amp; Last option:  Surgery<br /><br />This is the option I hope you are able to avoid, but in some instances where my other 4 options haven't worked, it may be necessary to seek the professional opinion of a surgeon.<br /><br />Having loose skin after weight loss cannot always be solved without surgery, but I would still urge you to give the first 4 options a shot before reaching out to your doctor or surgeon.<br /><br />I really hope this information has been helpful for you, and wish you all the best as you continue your lifelong journey of being a fit father!<br /><br />If you feel your lifestyle could use an improvement, then check out our FF30X 30-Day Transformation Program at → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-ff30x-program">https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-ff30x-program</a><br />If you want to start putting on muscle TODAY, check out our Fit Father Old School Muscle Building Program at → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-osm-program">https://www.fitfatherproject.com/youtube-osm-program</a><br /><br />Your friends here at the FFP,<br /><br />-Dr. Balduzzi + The Men's Health Experts @ The Fit Father Project<br /><br />**Disclaimer: This information is for reference purposes ONLY and cannot replace personal information you can and should discuss with your Doctor.
