{% raw %}On 14th January 2020 at General Assembly as part of LWP January: new year, new framework?<br /><br />Do you use React but wonder how your code might look if it was written in Vue? Do you use Vue and wonder what your code would look like in React? Or maybe you use Angular and stay awake at night wondering how things might look in React and/or Vue. Here we will build the exact same app in React and Vue, comparing both each step of the way.<br /><br />Leaving our personal framework/library biases at the door, you should hopefully leave this talk with an understanding of how React and Vue approach component-based applications, enabling you to make your own decisions whether to embrace what lies on the other side of the fence.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ldnwebperf.org/sessions/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-here-are-the-differences/">https://ldnwebperf.org/sessions/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-here-are-the-differences/</a>{% endraw %}
