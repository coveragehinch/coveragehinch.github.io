I've also heard good things about Behr's Urethane Alkyd - t.ly/gyCx - however I've never used this one and can't comment on how it holds up in a kitchen. Probably pretty well though. <br /><br />Primer - Rustoleum Automotive Primer (cabinet handles only) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/398HWhF">https://amzn.to/398HWhF</a><br />Gold paint - Rustoleum Satin Bronze (cabinet handles) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39dMJhG">https://amzn.to/39dMJhG</a><br />Polyurethane - Varathane Triple Thick (cabinet handles) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3lM4OIX">https://amzn.to/3lM4OIX</a><br />Wagner Paint Sprayers - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2PoZK15.">https://bit.ly/2PoZK15.</a>  The model I'm using in the video (Wagner Wide Shot) is older and unfortunately not available on their site any longer.
