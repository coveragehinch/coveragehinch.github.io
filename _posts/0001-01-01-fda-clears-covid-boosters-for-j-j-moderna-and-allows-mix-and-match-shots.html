{% raw %}Meg Tirrell joins 'Closing Bell' to report the FDA has issued Covid boosters for Moderna and J&amp;J. The eligibility groups for Moderna and Pfizer boosters currently remain the same.

The committee recommended Moderna boosters for the elderly and at-risk adults six months after completing their primary series of shots — bringing it in line with Pfizer’s distribution plan — while endorsing J&amp;J boosters for everyone 18 and older who received the initial shot at least two months ago.<br /><br />The ruling will now be handed off to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its vaccine advisory committee, which has scheduled a meeting Thursday to discuss Moderna and J&amp;J’s booster data. If the committee issues a recommendation, and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signs off, additional shots for those vaccines could be distributed immediately to eligible people.<br /><br />The authorization would open booster doses up to the more than 15 million people who’ve been inoculated with J&amp;J’s shots and the more than 69 million people who have been fully immunized with Moderna’s vaccine.<br /><br />Eligible Americans will also be able to “mix and match” vaccines. A highly anticipated National Institutes of Health study published last week showed all the combinations of boosters increased antibody levels higher, though Pfizer’s and Moderna’s boosters appeared to work best.<br /><br />The FDA said Wednesday it has identified an increased risk of rare inflammatory heart conditions, myocarditis and pericarditis, following vaccination with the Moderna vaccine, particularly following the second dose. Usually, onset of symptoms has been a few days following vaccination, it said. The observed risk is higher among males under 40 years of age, particularly males 18 through 24.<br /><br />Pfizer’s boosters were authorized less than a month ago to a wide array of Americans, including the elderly, adults with underlying medical conditions, and those who work or live in high-risk settings, such as health-care and grocery workers.<br /><br />Booster shots have been a contentious topic for scientists — in and outside the government — especially as many people in the U.S. and other parts of the world have yet to receive even one dose of a vaccine. The World Health Organization has pleaded with wealthy countries to hold off on distributing boosters, and some scientists say they aren’t convinced most Americans need them right now.<br /><br />Some committee members said Thursday the boosters should prevent so-called breakthrough infections, which they said is critical for protecting health-care institutions from becoming overwhelmed, while other members said the third shots should ensure those at high risk won’t suffer from severe disease. Some on the committee also suggested young people may not need boosters, as the initial shots are still holding up in those groups.<br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a> <br /><br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
