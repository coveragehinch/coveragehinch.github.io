{% raw %}Peace be to you ALL (AsSalama'laikum)! I have been a Physician Associate and health educator for more than two decades. I currently work as a Hospitalist PA in Washington, D.C. where I live with my wife and children. I am also an erstwhile PA professor and admissions committee member. Remember that what PAs make on AVERAGE, does NOT always include outliers. My first PA job paid $56K/yr which I supplemented with a $24K adjunct faculty job. This was 20 years ago, though. I've made close to $170K/yr (many hours, though😥😫). There's always that mystical PA out there making 😒 $400K/yr.🦄  You can expect to make $130K/yr to $160K/yr ($65 to $80/hr) after a five years of experience, especially if you work in ER, hospitalist, surgery or, derm. This is about $100K less than the average Physician (M.D./D.O.). <br />FACTORS: <br />1) Experience <br />2) Location<br />3) Services (procedures, 💉🛠🔪✍🏾)<br />4) Reimbursement <br />5) Specialty <br /><br />Instagram o_abdulmalik{% endraw %}
