{% raw %}Ask any aspiring doctor and they will agree that some specialties are more competitive to get into than others. Ask them why, and you will get a variety of answers. What are the underlying factors that actually determine a specialty‚Äôs competitiveness? <br /><br />We must first discuss how to determine a specialty's competitiveness, and it isn't a matter of simply looking at the match rate. Match rate alone is a poor metric, as medical students self select into specialties they are likely to match into. Therefore, it's important to take into account not only match rate, but also USMLE Step 1, USMLE Step 2CK, AOA, publication count, and percentage of applicants from a top 40 NIH funded program.<br /><br />Next, it's a matter of supply and demand. Which factors effect supply and which effect demand are complex, but boil down to money, prestige, and societal demand.<br /><br />üíå Sign up for my weekly newsletter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://medschoolinsiders.com/newsletter">https://medschoolinsiders.com/newsletter</a><br />üåç Website &amp; blog - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://medschoolinsiders.com">https://medschoolinsiders.com</a><br /><br />üì∏ Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/medschoolinsiders">https://instagram.com/medschoolinsiders</a><br />üê¶ Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/medinsiders">https://twitter.com/medinsiders</a><br />üó£Ô∏è Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/medschoolinsiders">https://facebook.com/medschoolinsiders</a><br /><br />üé• My Youtube Gear: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/kevinjubbalmd/">https://kit.co/kevinjubbalmd/</a><br />üëÄ Hand Picked Productivity Tools: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/medschoolinsiders">https://www.amazon.com/shop/medschoolinsiders</a><br />üéµMy Study Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1231934998/playlist/5joGbr1aQAIbMcJ9bOvJlk?si=iOAxgKNTQt-rrp1L8g-YWQ">https://open.spotify.com/user/1231934998/playlist/5joGbr1aQAIbMcJ9bOvJlk?si=iOAxgKNTQt-rrp1L8g-YWQ</a><br /><br />TIME STAMPS:<br />00:00 Introduction<br />00:30 How Do We Define a Specialty‚Äôs Competitiveness?<br />03:03 What Factors Affect Supply?<br />05:38 What Factors Affect Demand?<br /><br />LINKS FROM VIDEO:<br />5 Most Competitive Specialties: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/yYWQClpEvRM">https://youtu.be/yYWQClpEvRM</a><br />6 Least Competitive Specialties: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cU5DzpF5yHg">https://youtu.be/cU5DzpF5yHg</a><br />NRMP Match Explained: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mFh3JIaMGJo">https://youtu.be/mFh3JIaMGJo</a><br /><br />#medicalschool #studystrategies #premed<br />====================<br /><br />Disclaimer: Content of this video is my opinion and does not constitute medical advice.
