{% raw %}I didn’t originally plan on becoming an ERP, HCM, or CRM consultant, but 20+ years later, it’s all I’ve ever done - and now we have a global team of consultants helping some of the world’s most forward-thinking organizations through their ERP and digital transformation journeys.<br /><br />This video outlines my career path, observations, and mistakes along the way. Most importantly, I outline the traits that I think are the most important to becoming a great career consultant. And as a spoiler alert: none of the most important traits have anything to do with technical knowledge or competency.  <br /><br />This summarizes the most important advice I can give to anyone wanting to differentiate themselves and become a great ERP, HCM, or CRM consultant. I’m curious to hear your feedback in the comments below! I also encourage those that want to work for our firm, which is leading the global independent digital transformation movement, to submit your CV in the link below.
