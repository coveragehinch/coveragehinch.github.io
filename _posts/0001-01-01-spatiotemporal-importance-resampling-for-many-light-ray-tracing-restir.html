{% raw %}NVIDIA and Dartmouth College researchers collaborated to create an ACM SIGGRAPH 2020 paper showing how to render dynamic direct lighting and shadows from millions of area lights in real-time. This was previously impossible. This video shows real-time rendering of scenes with many dynamic lights, and all lighting and shadowing are computed using the ReSTIR algorithm described in the paper, plus a denoising algorithm.
