{% raw %}In this video I'm throwing, trimming, handling and finally carving the handles on these simple angled stoneware mugs. A new form from a whole batch of testing I did to find a different shape. I also discuss some of my making philosophies and discuss cleaning my studio towards the end. Not necessarily an interesting bonus but it's strangely a subject I get asked about a lot.<br /><br />If you'd like to see what I'm up to everyday, make sure you follow my Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/floriangadsby">https://www.instagram.com/floriangadsby</a><br /><br />Spinners made by Richard Carter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/richardcarter6952/">https://www.instagram.com/richardcarter6952/</a> (If you get in touch with him he should be able to make and send you one, although they do look a little different now as compared to the one in then video, which was a prototype).<br /><br />Timecodes:<br />0:00 - Introduction<br />0:18 - Preparing and wedging clay<br />1:58 - Throwing the clay batt, onto which I attach my MDF batts<br />3:45 - Cross section of angled mug<br />4:15 - Throwing the mug<br />8:54 - Trimming the mug<br />15:41 - Preparing handling area and pulling blanks<br />18:09 - Handling then mug<br />22:07 - Carving the handle<br />24:39 - Quality control/tidying the base<br />26:24 - Discussing my cleaning routine in the studio<br />____<br /><br />TikTok – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@floriangadsby">https://www.tiktok.com/@floriangadsby</a><br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.floriangadsby.com">http://www.floriangadsby.com</a>{% endraw %}
