{% raw %}This is a song Justin Brown sung on his door-to-door-busking adventures around the UK. He only had one tune - and this was it! <br /><br />It's all about how Harry Potter should grow up and get a real job. After all, magic's not going to pay the bills forever. <br /><br />Justin wrote about it in his book - 'UK on a G-String.' Enjoy!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/UK-G-String-Stranded-Kiwi-Busks-ebook/dp/B00GBFUVIE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479368849&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=uk+on+a+g+string">https://www.amazon.co.uk/UK-G-String-Stranded-Kiwi-Busks-ebook/dp/B00GBFUVIE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479368849&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=uk+on+a+g+string</a>{% endraw %}
