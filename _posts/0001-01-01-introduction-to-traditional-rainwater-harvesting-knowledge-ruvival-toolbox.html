Over centuries, people in diverse geographical positions relied on rainwater and developed indigenous knowledge and techniques to harvest rainwater. Traditional Rainwater Harvesting is a process that requires the concentration, collection and storage of rainwater for a number of purposes. Some examples of traditional rainwater harvesting include qanats, contour-bench terracing, spate irrigation, khuskhaba system, rooftop rainfall collection and cisterns.<br /><br />RUVIVAL - Sustainable Rural Development and highly productive New Towns is concerned with restoring degraded areas and creating new not just inhabitable, but liveable spaces. It is an e-learning project of the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) in cooperation with the Hamburg Open Online University (HOOU).<br /><br />Traditional Rainwater Harvesting Knowledge by Sumbal Tasawwar and Ruth Schaldach <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/99-QLqfvOzE">https://youtu.be/99-QLqfvOzE</a> is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0.">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0.</a>{% endraw %}
