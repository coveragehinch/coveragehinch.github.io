{% raw %}On the occasion of receiving The Washington Institute's Scholar-Statesman Award, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan discusses his country's motivation for making peace with Israel with Institute Executive Director Dr. Robert Satloff (English and Arabic with subtitles). The  conversation took place in Abu Dhabi in October 2021 before the November 18, 2021 Scholar-Statesman Award event in New York City.<br /><br />The Institute’s Scholar-Statesman Award celebrates outstanding leaders, who, through their public service and professional achievements, exemplify the idea that sound scholarship and a discerning knowledge of history are essential to wise and effective policy and the advancement of peace and security in the Middle East.<br /><br />Excerpts from the conversation:<br /><br />SHEIKH MOHAMMED BIN ZAYED (ARABIC, TRANSLATED TO ENGLISH): Why did we make this big decision for peace? We saw this as a unique opportunity. We decided that there would be a diplomatic relationship. For us, this is an important decision for many reasons. First, for the Palestinians themselves. Second, to send a clear message to the world and the region that we are striving for peace. Third, it is a mission that we have inherited from our founder, the late Sheikh Zayed, God rest his soul. He was a man of peace and compassion, since the days of the UAE’s inception. That is his vision, and we are committed to this path. <br /><br />DR. SATLOFF: Okay. It is said that when leaders make a decision for peace, it’s often a bold decision. When you and your colleagues made this decision for peace, how did you assess the risks? <br /><br />SHEIKH MOHAMMED BIN ZAYED (ARABIC, TRANSLATED TO ENGLISH): Every decision has risks, undoubtedly. We are also living in a complex region. But the rewards are an incentive, and the outcomes we will achieve together are far greater than the drawbacks. When we decided on this step, we were looking forward to a level of cooperation that goes beyond just peace itself. The UAE aspires to a greater peace, one that is for the benefit of all.{% endraw %}
