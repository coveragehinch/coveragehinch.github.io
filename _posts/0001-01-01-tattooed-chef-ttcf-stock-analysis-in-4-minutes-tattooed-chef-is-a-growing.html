{% raw %}Tattooed Chef is a growing plant based food manufacturer. They currently make freezer aisle meals but are expanding their product offerings. They’re a cult retail investor stock–also one that some people seem to love to hate. Today let’s strip the emotion away and take a quick look at this company.<br /><br />If you like the outro music, check creator here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_qPXspaErcz5ge1GjVH1Dw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_qPXspaErcz5ge1GjVH1Dw</a><br />Workload permitting, you may hire him to make you custom music.<br /><br />Tattooed Chef went public a year and a half ago and is led by President and CEO, Sam Galletti. Sam has 35 years of experience in the food industry and has developed the skills and relationships to excel in this industry and partner with retailers who will supply Tattooed Chef products.<br /><br />There are a lot of good things to say about the trajectory of the company, but one key piece of information I’d like to highlight is the fact that this company is vertically integrated (page 9). I know it’s a business buzzword, but it is truly a valuable component to the company. Vertically integrated means that Tattooed Chef manages the stages of production. They source and manufacture the products they sell. This gives them certain cost advantages, gives them greater control, and shields them from certain outside risks.<br /><br />When it comes to my opinion on the matter the first thing to point out is I like their food. I’ve had a few of there products and have been genuinely impressed by the flavor. The cauliflower crust pizza was impressively good. If nobody told me it was a cauliflower crust, I would not have even noticed. Very solid for a frozen pizza.<br /><br />As far as their valuation goes, based off of 2021 revenue estimates they come in at a 6.71 P/S ratio. Despite BYND crashing the last few months, it’s still trading at a 9.3 P/S ratio. Add to that the fact that TTCF is growing much more quickly and it starts to make TTCF look like the obvious choice. Don’t get me wrong, a P/S ratio above 6 for a food company is no steal–you have to believe in the long term for the company, but if you do it is definitely reasonably priced.<br /><br />In my opinion the biggest risk faced by TTCF is that it’s revenue growth dramatically slows down due to slower movement of product which could lead to grocery stores kicking out their products. Right now this doesn’t look super likely since the exact opposite is happening, but it’s important to realize that something like this could be devastating for TTCF.<br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: The topics covered in this video, and my others, are opinion and should not be considered financial advice.
