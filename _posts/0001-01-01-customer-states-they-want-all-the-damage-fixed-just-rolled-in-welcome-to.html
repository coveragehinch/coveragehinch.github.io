The first thing you see is a big hole in the transfer case of this Infiniti which looks to be pretty new by looking at the undercarriage. <br />0:40 Unfortunately don't know the exhaust issue since the customer didn't approve further diagnosis.<br />0:53 From what I've read and heard. Cracked blocks seem to be a common issue on 2006-2009 Honda Civics' and I believe it was even a recall. If you know more about this issue, please let us know in the comments.<br />1:01 I'm also surprised this drove in lol. Impressive!<br />1:24 Mechanic said: &quot;The manufacturer sent a representative to take care of the issue. And we were no longer involved.&quot;<br />1:35 Mechanic said: &quot;Three Honda Accords all three cats were stolen . They are 2500 each my cost in California &quot;<br />1:42 Looks to be on a Ford Focus. Let's hope they weren't driving super fast on those spare tires.<br />1:55 Snake on a battery. That would surprise me as well. Glad we don't have snakes like that here lol.<br />2:05 Apparently the customer drove the vehicle in like this, from what the mechanic said.<br />2:11 Not sure if this was a joke perhaps, but wanted to share this with you guys!<br />2:27 Let's hope they don't get in an accident. That's gonna hurt! This is also the most amount of jewels I've seen inside a customers vehicle.<br />2:37 First time seeing a Jeep Limousine!<br />2:53 Outro. Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
