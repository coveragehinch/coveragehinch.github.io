{% raw %}The world is full of appetizing food, and we sincerely hope you're enjoying it. However, every culture and region also has cuisine that's not so appetizing, at least to outsiders. These delicacies may feature uncommon ingredients, unusual preparation methods like aging and fermentation, or sources that are dangerous to consume in certain circumstances. Most of us would simply pass if offered one of these dishes, but the more adventurous among our viewers will definitely want to try them all. Maybe you already have one of these regional specialties available in your neighborhood. Strap on your bib, dear viewer, and venture with us into the unknown. These are really weird foods you should at least have a taste of once.<br /><br />#Foods #Weird #Taste <br /><br />Huitlacoche | 0:14<br />Kool-Aid pickles | 1:01<br />Turducken | 1:45<br />Miracle berry | 2:36<br />Burgoo | 3:38<br />Escargot | 4:18<br />Rattlesnake | 4:47<br />Poutine | 5:17<br />Casu marzu | 6:01<br />Live octopus sushi | 6:40<br />Black pudding | 7:21<br />Sweetbreads | 7:56<br />Rocky Mountain oysters | 8:34<br />Scrapple | 9:15<br />Natto | 10:03<br />Stinky tofu | 10:46<br />Civet coffee | 11:44<br />Balut | 12:58<br />Guinea pig | 13:42<br />Haggis | 14:24<br />HÃ¡karl | 15:00<br />Chaudin | 15:41<br />Head cheese | 16:13<br />Jellied moose nose | 16:15<br />Chitlins | 17:25<br />Frog's legs | 18:03<br />Fugu | 18:53<br />Escamoles | 19:36<br />Fried tarantulas | 20:18<br />Century egg | 21:03<br />Salo | 21:40<br />Lamprey | 22:18<br /><br />Read Full Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mashed.com/188109/40-bizarre-foods-you-need-to-try-before-you-die/">https://www.mashed.com/188109/40-bizarre-foods-you-need-to-try-before-you-die/</a>{% endraw %}
