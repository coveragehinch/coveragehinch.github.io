In the last year, overall markets are up 10-30%. The advantage is that, by doing this, you get the diversification of 500 different companies - and, this single investment has shown to outperform 95% of actively managed funds<br /><br />TWO: INDIVIDUAL STOCKS<br />Some, like GameStop and AMC, have rallied over 1000% - and overs are up over 100%. However, as I’m sure you already know…the higher the REWARD…the higher the RISK… and, the downside is that…if you pick WRONG…you could lose a LOT. To prevent this from happening: <br />-Don't Invest Everything<br />Ideally, you should ONLY allocate a small part of your portfolio for more speculative investments - and that’s it.<br />- Don't Buy Hype <br />I have to say, nearly EVERY SINGLE TIME I see some momentum gathering online, or an upcoming, highly-anticipated even that’s about to send its share price to the moon….it turns out to be already priced in, and things immediately fall while you’re left holding the bag. <br />-Understand Your Investment<br />At least understand what you’re buying, how they make money, how long you plan to hold, and whether or not you can afford a loss. <br /><br />THREE: INVESTING IN A ROTH IRA<br />A Roth IRA is just a retirement account that lets you contribute up to $6000 per year of after-tax money, and then anything you earn WITHIN that account is completely tax-free after the age of 59.5.<br /><br />FOUR: CRYPTOCURRENCY <br />First, research shows that - you don’t need to invest a lot of money to make a difference. <br />In fact, Fidelity found that just a 5% allocation to Bitcoin would’ve boosted the cumulative return of a traditional portfolio by 65% since 2014, even despite the sell-offs along the way. Second, most data shows that you’re best off sticking with the Top 10 Cryptocurrencies by market cap…and then, doing absolutely nothing. Even from there, HISTORICALLY, the largest returns - overall - have still come from the top 2 of Bitcoin and Ethereum. <br /><br />FIVE: ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS<br />For example - nostalgic collectibles, which have ALREADY been appreciating at a rather consistent pace…or, classic cars - which, have nearly kept pace with the SP500 over the last 10 years. Even the right contemporary art has appreciated 14% annually since 1995, leading people to believe that - this is something to be taken seriously. The downside, however, is that the collectible market IS VERY ILLIQUID, and often depends waiting for the right buyer, at the right time…so, in the event you need cash immediately - you’re either forced to sell for a massive loss to someone like me who wants a deal, or - you’ll have to patiently wait as long as it takes. <br /><br />SIX: REAL ESTATE<br />Everyone needs a place to live, you can leverage your money, have complete control over the property, lock in a low rate, and get massive tax savings. That’s why I’ve invested SO MUCH MONEY into real estate over this last decade, and why it continues to be my biggest investment throughout everything I’ve done.<br /><br />My ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB">https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB</a><br /><br />For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
