{% raw %}Our favourite drinks, fast food restaurants, chocolates, sweets and other treats are all connected to an iconic image. A logo. Each brand is unique, each with their own spark. Coca Cola and McDonalds have logos that are known around the world. Learn the history of how these iconic logos came to be, and perhaps you may find some beauty in the story of design within.<br /><br />For business inquiries please contact: magnifyevo@gmail.com<br /><br />Music from Epidemic Sound{% endraw %}
