{% raw %}ABOUT CHRISTIAN <br />From his Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://awalkinthephysical.com/about/">https://awalkinthephysical.com/about/</a><br /><br />Christian has worked for over 15 years as a project manager for complex nuclear pump and valve manufacturing projects, some valued at over $100MM. Christian is also a public speaker, having presented at over 80 events.<br /><br />When Christian was a young child he remembered his existence before coming to Earth. While that memory left him completely for his early adult life, it spontaneously returned at the age of 30 as Christian took up a meditation practice and went through a personal awakening journey. He also began to have Out of Body Experiences (OBEs). Christian now seeks to remind others in at least a small part of who we really are beneath the human “play.” Christian is the author of the book A Walk in the Physical, which attempts to succinctly describe the larger spiritual context in which we exist and the importance of love in our human journey. <br /><br />This video is an except from a larger video from the IANDS’s 2021 Virtual Conference. <br /><br />ABOUT IANDS <br />IANDS is a membership nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization with a mission to advance an understanding of near-death and related experiences through research, education, and support. We envision a future in which all people embrace near-death and related experiences as a source of meaning and inspiration for a better world. We believe a near-death experience can transform an individual’s life, influence the sciences, and embolden society. The International Association for Near-Death Studies, (IANDS) engages in far more than research today. IANDS has members from around the world. We invite you to consider becoming a member of IANDS.

Thank you! <br /><br />What is a NDE or Near-Death Experience? <br />A near-death experience (NDE) is typically a profound, life changing, intensely emotional experience that usually occurs during a clinical crisis and has common characteristics and aftereffects. It is not a dream, hallucination, or mental illness (Greyson, 1983). There are no predictive variables to identify who will have an NDE. They happen to people of all ages, religions, socio-economic groups, cultures, educational backgrounds, and belief systems. They occur under a variety of circumstances such as accidents, near-drownings, illnesses, combat, surgical procedures, and childbirth. Following an NDE, experiencers (NDErs) often display some common aftereffects. Research has established a set of common NDE characteristics and long-term aftereffects. Common theories used to explain near-death experiences have been proven inadequate by NDE researchers and others.{% endraw %}
