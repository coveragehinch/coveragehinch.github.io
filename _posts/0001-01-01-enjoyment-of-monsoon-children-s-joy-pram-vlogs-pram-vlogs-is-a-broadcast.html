{% raw %}Pram Vlogs is a broadcast that basically records and shares family moments with a child. Pradeep Bastola and Amrita Khanal are the host husband and wife of the video documentary. <br />&quot;On this video, we have enjoyed the monsoon that has arrived in Nepal. Moreover, I have started the vlog from 'Bhaktapur Durbar Square,' and with the catch, a little narration at the end.{% endraw %}
