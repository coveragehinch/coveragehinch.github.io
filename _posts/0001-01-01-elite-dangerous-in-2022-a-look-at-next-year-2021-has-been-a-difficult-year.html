{% raw %}2021 has been a difficult year for Elite Dangerous.  Pretty much everyone is aware of that, and at this point there’s little reason to rehash old ground.  So, as I often do at this time of the year – let’s take a look forwards to what comes next for the game.<br /><br />The next big thing then will be Fleet Carrier Interiors.  We’ve seen a preview of this – both an official one, as well as a sneaky unintended look.  You can see footage from both of those on screen right now.  There’s also a link to the tour video – if you haven’t had a chance to look at that yet.<br /><br />If you would like to help support my channel, please check my Patreon page:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/obsidianant">https://www.patreon.com/obsidianant</a><br />PayPal Donation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=H5LJ5URGUB7ZQ">https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=H5LJ5URGUB7ZQ</a><br />Any support is massively appreciated!<br /><br /><br />Fleet Carrier Video<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2dXsLrc1T7s">https://youtu.be/2dXsLrc1T7s</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Music<br />Epidemic Sound<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />#EliteDangerous{% endraw %}
