{% raw %}At Pingtung’s Chang Shing Primary School, as many as 30% of the children are raised by their grandparents. Among them, about 80% are from low or middle-to-low income households. Although these children tend to have less educational support, they’re getting a boost from a government-led program. Through a digital self-guided learning program, children use tablets to brush up on their lessons during recess and after school. The program has made learning much more fun, and it’s helping to close the disadvantage gap. <br /><br />Although there’s only a half day of class on Wednesday, the children are still gathered at the library of Chang Shing Primary School. They’re doing schoolwork on their devices.<br /><br />Chiu Pin-i<br />Chang Shing Primary School fourth-grader<br />If you access the adaptive learning website using a tablet, just select “my tasks” and then click “practice questions” or “watch videos.” The videos themselves have practice questions, which makes it all the more convenient.<br /><br />Hsu I-ting<br />Chang Shing Primary School fourth-grader<br />By doing my homework in this way, I am able to get some extra knowledge.<br /><br />Hsiao Chih-yu<br />Chang Shing Primary School fourth-grader<br />Because tablets are so convenient to use, afterward, during recess, you can go directly to the adaptive learning website and take a quiz to see if you learned what the teacher taught.<br /><br />During noon recess, children can use tablets to brush up on their lessons, in a program known as the “little bee project.” After school, they can take the tablets home for their studies, in what’s known as the “firefly project.” Chang Shing Primary School lends out tablets in a smooth streamlined process to maximize their effectiveness.<br /><br />Parent<br />We have discussions with each other. I feel that this has actually enhanced our parent-child relationship.<br /><br />Chen Shu-hui<br />Chang Shing Primary School principal<br />Chang Shing has insisted on promoting digital learning. The main reason is that we’re anxious over having teachers use the knowledge they learned in the past to teach today’s children, to prepare them for the society of the future. We very much hope that, through digital learning and through devices, we can connect our children with the world.<br /><br />At Chang Shing Primary School, as many as 30% of the students are raised by their grandparents. About 80% of them are also from low- or middle-to-low income households. Through adaptive digital learning, the school is closing the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers. It’s also expanding the time that students can devote to education, and helping to stimulate each child’s learning potential.{% endraw %}
