The former Chelsea and Liverpool academy coach tells us about his time in Brazil as São Paulo’s assistant manager, how the Brazilian way of playing has always influenced his coaching, and the differences he noticed between the young players he coached at Chelsea and Liverpool. Beale also explains what it is like working with Steven Gerrard – his manager at Rangers – and also recommends his favourite books for aspiring coaches, including Martí Perarnau’s Pep Confidential, Dennis Bergkamp’s Stillness and Speed and Quiet Leadership by Carlo Ancelotti.<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://coachesvoice.com">https://coachesvoice.com</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CoachesVoice">https://twitter.com/CoachesVoice</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/CoachesVoice">https://facebook.com/CoachesVoice</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/CoachesVoice">https://instagram.com/CoachesVoice</a><br /><br />The Coaches' Voice Academy<br />Subscribe today: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academy.coachesvoice.com/join">https://academy.coachesvoice.com/join</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academy.coachesvoice.com">https://academy.coachesvoice.com</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/cv_academy">https://twitter.com/cv_academy</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/cv_academy">https://instagram.com/cv_academy</a><br />Join our coaching forum: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/31BuDA3">http://bit.ly/31BuDA3</a>{% endraw %}
