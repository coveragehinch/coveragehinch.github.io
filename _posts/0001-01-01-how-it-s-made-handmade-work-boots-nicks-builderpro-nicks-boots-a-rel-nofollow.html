{% raw %}Nicks Boots: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nicksboots.com/">https://nicksboots.com/</a><br /><br />In this video, we show you how our BuilderPro™ FT Black is made from start to finish. Stick around for the final product! All Nicks Boots are made here in Spokane, WA from the finest parts and materials. We are USA-owned and operated, valuing the livelihoods of our workers as well as the quality of our boots. If you're looking for the toughest work boots on the market, you've finally come to the right place. <br /><br />If you're interested in how our boots are serviced, check out other content on our YouTube channel! While most boots are meant to be thrown away after a few months, Nicks are built to last. When your boots start to need some servicing, you can send them in to have them resoled or completely rebuilt! Nicks Handmade Boots are serviceable and last years longer than a mass-produced boot. Since 1964, Nicks has been making the highest quality boots on the market, right here in Spokane Washington. If you're tired of your old work boots wearing out, upgrade to Nicks and enjoy the most comfortable boots on the market. <br /><br />How to Clean Your Boots: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaEcpuKh5M0&amp;t=20s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaEcpuKh5M0&amp;t=20s</a><br /><br />FAQS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nicksboots.com/resources/faq/">https://nicksboots.com/resources/faq/</a><br /><br />Nicks Boots on Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nickshandmadeboots/">https://www.instagram.com/nickshandmadeboots/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/nickshandmadeboots">https://www.facebook.com/nickshandmadeboots</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/nicksboots1964">https://twitter.com/nicksboots1964</a><br /><br />The equipment we use for our videos:<br />Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3sg4h3K">https://amzn.to/3sg4h3K</a><br />Main Light: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3qP8Hyv">https://amzn.to/3qP8Hyv</a><br />Tripod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3dEUrVb">https://amzn.to/3dEUrVb</a><br />Storage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NBOVId">https://amzn.to/2NBOVId</a><br />Software: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NrC3Vg">https://amzn.to/2NrC3Vg</a><br /><br />Links are either product links through the Nicks Boots website or are affiliate links.<br /><br />#handmade #usa #nicksboots{% endraw %}
