{% raw %}- At  birth, a baby's brain contains 100 billion neurons, as many nerve cells as there are stars in the Milky Way.<br />- By 2-3 years a child's brain has about 200 trillion nerve cell connections (synapses), which is twice the number of an adult.<br />- The learning experiences of the child determine which connections are developed and which will no longer function.<br />- That is why the early childhood years are crucial for making these connections.<br />- Stimulation during the first three years of a child's life help to prevent changes to the brain structure.{% endraw %}
