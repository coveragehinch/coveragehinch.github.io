She is determined to make childbirth as comfortable for the baby as she can and hopes to give birth naturally, avoiding the need for a C-section.  She believes it will create a stronger bond between mother and child. As a pole dancing teacher, she thought her physical fitness would make the labour much easier. The reality proved very different as unexpected complications turned the experience into a long lasting ordeal.<br /><br />Anna is also 27 and about to have her first child. She’s expecting a girl and throughout her pregnancy she’s talked to her baby. Now she believes the new born will recognise her voice, which will help them bond from the outset and she can’t wait to meet her daughter, Milana. The doctors are confident that Anna is well prepared to birth, both physically and emotionally. Anna admits that started going to antenatal classes, but never finished them. All she can remember is that when the baby is making its way into the world, she needs to listen to the doctors.<br /><br />Where do Russians come from? In modern Russia, life usually begins at state-run maternity hospitals; it is up to these medical establishments to deliver new babies into the world. RTd takes you inside the delivery room, where you'll meet expectant mothers, nervous fathers, and the men and women whose task it is to perform deliveries and face any challenges that stand in the way.
