{% raw %}Lana Wachowski is back behind the camera for The Matrix Resurrections, the fourth film in the series that brings back both Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).<br /><br />In The Matrix Resurrections, return to a world of two realities: one, everyday life; the other, what lies behind it. To find out if his reality is a physical or mental construct, to truly know himself, Mr. Anderson will have to choose to follow the white rabbit once more. And if Thomas…Neo…has learned anything, it’s that choice, while an illusion, is still the only way out of—or into— the Matrix.<br /><br />We have two clips from the sequel, both of which feel like heavy spoilers. In the first, Candyman's Yahya Abdul-Mateen II replaces Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus and once again offers Neo a pill. This time, only the red one.<br /><br />As for the second bit of footage, it appears to be a pretty huge spoiler that was teased in the first trailer. Neo, seemingly riding on a train, walks into a room that's wallpapered with a projection of the first Matrix film.<br /><br />The Matrix Resurrections will release December 22, both in theaters and on HBO Max.<br /><br />Watch FREE horror streaming 24/7 on Bloody Disgusting TV!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bloodydisgusting.tv">https://bloodydisgusting.tv</a><br /><br />Never miss a horror headline, follow us on<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/bdisgusting">https://instagram.com/bdisgusting</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/bdisgusting">https://twitter.com/bdisgusting</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/BloodyDisgusting">https://facebook.com/BloodyDisgusting</a><br /><br />Your #1 source for all things horror since 2001!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com">https://bloody-disgusting.com</a>{% endraw %}
