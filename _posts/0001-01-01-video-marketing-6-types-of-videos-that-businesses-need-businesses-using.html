{% raw %}Businesses using video grow revenue 49% faster year-over-year than organisations without.<br /><br />But what type of videos are there, and how can you implement them?<br /><br />1. About Us Video<br />This video tells the story of your business. Focus on WHY you do what you do, not WHAT you do. What makes your business special and what sets you apart?<br /><br />2. How to video <br />These are short, punchy videos. Such as life hacks, quick tips for success etc. These add value to someones life, which means they are more likely to get shared. <br /><br />4. Product review video<br />This is where you do an in-depth review or tutorial that showcases the features and benefits of your products or services.<br /><br />3. Lead magnet video<br />A lead magnet is an offer you give in exchange for a persons contact information, such as a downloadable checklist, a free trial, or a free consultation.<br /><br />5. Customer testimonial video<br />Testimonial videos are simple interviews with happy customers. These are a great way to validate and build trust in your brand.<br /><br />6. Sales video<br />This is where you ask your audience to take the next step and become paying customers. These work better if you’ve done the previous videos first, as the audience will have developed trust in you.<br /><br />--<br /><br />We’re Josh and Matt, and over the past few years we have been building a huge body of creative work.
