{% raw %}Why Jesy Nelson Is More Problematic Than You Think<br /><br /><br />The group of our dreams rose to fame ten years ago, in 2011, when Jesy Nelson, Perrie Edwards, Jade Thirlwall, and Leigh-Anne Pinnock won X-Factor. Since then, it’s been a rollercoaster, to say the least! Little Mix has been topping charts and even became the first-ever girl band to win the best British group award at the 2021 Brits! <br /><br /><br />Did Jesy Nelson use her mental health as an excuse to leave Little Mix? Why has she been so jealous of her former bandmate, Leigh-Anne for years, and how on earth did Nicki Minaj get involved in all of this drama?! Stay tuned, because we’ve got all the Little Mix intel coming up!<br /><br />00:20 - The Bad Mix!<br />02:18 - The Set-Up…<br />04:14 - Going Solo!<br /><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO FOR THE BEST CELEB GOSSIP AND NEWS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJEY8C5wd0K99HYvQdVi6Vw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJEY8C5wd0K99HYvQdVi6Vw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />#littlemix #jesynelson #leighanne{% endraw %}
