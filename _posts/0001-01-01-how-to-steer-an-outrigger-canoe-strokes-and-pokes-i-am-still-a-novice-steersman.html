{% raw %}I am still a novice steersman, but I have a few tips that may help a paddler who wants to learn the basics. This video gives an overview of most of the strokes used to control the outrigger canoe. Any comments or advice are welcome. We can all learn from each other. A special thanks to Charlie from Menehune Paddles.

Thanks.{% endraw %}
