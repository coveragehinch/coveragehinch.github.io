{% raw %}TF2 is the game that achievement hunters dread. With 520 achievements to its name, some for hyper-specific modes or scenarios, you *really* have to try for them if you want to get them all. But after getting bored and farming for some achievements I didn't have yet, I realized something: TF2 has some really brutal ones. This video looks at some of the potentially hardest achievements in the game and why they're hard.

If nothing like that exists yet, I'd totally be down to making it happen.{% endraw %}
