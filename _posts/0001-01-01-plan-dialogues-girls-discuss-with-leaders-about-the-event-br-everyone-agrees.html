{% raw %}About the event<br />Everyone agrees: youth engagement in political decisions is crucial. But we need more spaces for young people, especially girls and young women, to engage with decision-makers in a meaningful way. That is why, on the occasion of World Children’s Day, Plan International launches the first edition of Plan Dialogues, an event bringing together girls and young women from around the world to discuss with decision-makers of the AU, EU and UN about girls’ rights, as well as their priorities on how humanitarian, human rights and peace and security systems can positively impact their lives.<br /><br />About the speakers<br />• Ambassador Stella Ronner-Grubačić - Special Advisor on Gender and Diversity at the European External Action Service (EEAS).<br />• Professor Sarah Anyang Agbor - African Union Commissioner for Human Resources, Science and Technology.<br />• Ms. Gillian Triggs - Assistant Secretary-General and Assistant High Commissioner for Protection with UNHCR.<br />AU, EU and  UN decision-makers will be joined by 5 inspiring young advocates who will be sharing their priorities and concerns with them. Specifically, Plan Dialogues will welcome Djamilatou (15) from Burkina Faso, Astrid (16) from Peru, Diko (18) from South Sudan, Hamide (19) from Germany and Stacia (15) from Uganda.{% endraw %}
