{% raw %}Hi all, this has been requested multiple times so here you go.<br />This video discusses the documents or requirements your sponsors would need to give you and include in the submission of your application plus some extra knowledge I can share about each one of them. This is what we followed for our Student visa (adult and minor), Open work permit, and tourist visa application. Hope this helps!<br /><br />Please don't forget to subscribe to my channel, like and share the videos, and connect with me! :)<br /><br />#Allaboutagatha<br />#ExplorewithAgatha<br />#Allaboutcanada<br />#Canadavisaapplication<br />#Sponsordocuments<br />#Sponsorrequirements<br />#studentvisacanada<br />#openworkpermitcanada<br />#touristvisacanada{% endraw %}
