{% raw %}A classic story of one man's confrontation with the self through Karate. In 1962 at age 22, C. W. Nicol left Wales to study Karate in Japan. He quickly found that the study of the martial art engaged his whole being and transformed his outlook on life. Moving Zen is the multifaceted story of a young man who arrived in Japan to study the technique of, and spirit behind Karate. Joining the Japan Karate Association (JKA) or Shotokan, Nicol discovered that Karate, while extremely violent, also called for politeness and a sense of mutual trust and responsibility.<br /><br />Nicol learned that the stronger the Karateka, the more inclined he was to be gentle with others. Those who have gained a measure of skill but have not yet achieved spiritual maturity are the dangerous practitioners.<br /><br />Studying Kata, Nicol came to realise that these forms are, in essence, moving Zen and that the ultimate goal of all the martial arts is tranquillity.<br /><br />I found this video on the internet.
