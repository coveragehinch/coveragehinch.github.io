{% raw %}Authentic Dirt Rooster merchandise  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://628-dirt-rooster.myshopify.com/">https://628-dirt-rooster.myshopify.com/</a><br /><br />The honey extraction and bottling portion of this video were shot this past summer 2021.  I stopped by to help mom and dad with some extracting.  Due to the weight of the honey boxes as well as the weight of the buckets of honey they needed a little help.  Good memories being made.<br /><br />The hive removal part of this video was shot in late summer of 2018.  The Mrs. and I finished the job together and she helped me with the documentation I was doing on this hive.  We planned to sell each comb as a whole piece along with a full diagram of the hive showing what part of the hive each section came from as well as all details related to location, time of year, rain fall, blooms and so on.  I was so busy with hive removals at the time that I scrapped the project in favor of saving that time to do work that would actually pay the bills.  I still would like to do that project at some point but who knows.  It may never happen.<br /><br />I wish I knew the back story on this house but I never bothered to look into it.  It was a beauty at one time.{% endraw %}
