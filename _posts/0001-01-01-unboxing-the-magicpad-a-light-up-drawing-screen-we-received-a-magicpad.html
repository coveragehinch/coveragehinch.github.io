{% raw %}We received a MagicPad™ for free from OnTel to play with and to review. This has been the thing that Andrew has wanted to have in the car and to play with in the morning and at night recently. I'm happy about that because it has kept him very entertained.<br /><br />More information about the MagicPad™<br /><br />*Kids can create art that glows with the all-new MagicPad™!<br />*MagicPad™ features an amazing crystal-clear, light-up screen that not only brings art to life, but also makes learning fun!<br />*Kids just insert one of the stencils behind the screen featuring games, art or learning.
