{% raw %}A recent op-ed written by Suzanne Lucas insinuates that employees are likely to leave their jobs soon after receiving year-end or holiday bonuses if there‚Äôs no long-term incentive for them to stay. As logical as this may seem, there are quite a few pitfalls in her suggestions to help keep employees in their roles. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian discuss on The Young Turks. Watch LIVE weekdays 6-8 pm ET. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/theyoungturks/live">http://youtube.com/theyoungturks/live</a><br /><br />Read more HERE:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/if-you-think-great-resignation-is-bad-just-wait-until-january.html">https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/if-you-think-great-resignation-is-bad-just-wait-until-january.html</a><br /><br />&quot;Year-end can come with holiday presents, parties, and year-end bonuses. It's also quite normal to do annual pay increases effective at the first of the new year.<br /><br />These things are all good, but they may impact what the Great Resignation looks like at your office. <br /><br />If year-end bonuses and raises are the norms in your company, your employees may hold off accepting that new job until the money is in their pockets. While companies shouldn't base new hires' salaries on their previous salaries, many do, and employees can use it as a negotiating tool. After all, why would they leave a job for less money than they make now? And who wants to quit three weeks before bonuses hit the bank account.&quot;<br /><br />*** <br /><br />The largest online progressive news show in the world. Hosted by Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian.
