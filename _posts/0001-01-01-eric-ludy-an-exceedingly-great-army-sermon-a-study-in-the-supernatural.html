{% raw %}*a study in the supernatural impetus behind spiritual success<br /><br />Human propensity leads us to attempt to do marvelous things for God . . . but without the enablement of God. This mistake is likely the one most often made in the life of the Christian — having great intentions to live triumphantly for Jesus without the necessary power to perform any of these great intentions.  <br /><br />In the book of Ezekiel chapter thirty-seven we see God’s pattern for constructing His heavenly army. At the start of chapter thirty-seven, we see an army in a useless condition, then as the chapter progresses, we see it matured and built soundly but still without the power to perform. And finally, we see the necessary supernatural impetus enter the story — we see the Holy Spirit enter into that army and activate it for real battle. <br /><br />The Church of Jesus Christ is in desperate need of the very same infusion of power. This is a message about the impelling strength of the Holy Spirit in the life the Church.  God intended us to have heaven-sized vision, yes, but not without with the heavenly empowerment of the Holy Spirit.  <br /><br /><br />» Take this message deeper in our five-part Daily Thunder Discussion: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ellerslie.com/an-exceedingly-great-army/">https://ellerslie.com/an-exceedingly-great-army/</a> or watch on YouTube:<br /><br />----------------------<br />An Exceedingly Great Army Sermon (by Eric Ludy): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/XtUXg67cwUc">https://youtu.be/XtUXg67cwUc</a><br />Discussion Part 1: The Willing Soldier - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZIpASdax3cc">https://youtu.be/ZIpASdax3cc</a><br />Discussion Part 2: The Ready Soldier (with Leslie Ludy) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mkxyntlcpoA">https://youtu.be/mkxyntlcpoA</a><br />Discussion Part 3: The Empowered Soldier - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/JoEIG-8wvyA">https://youtu.be/JoEIG-8wvyA</a><br />Discussion Part 4: The Pure Soldier (with Leslie Ludy) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/oKIQzv_wbo0">https://youtu.be/oKIQzv_wbo0</a><br />Discussion Part 5: The Happy Soldier (with Philip H) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9X35rQMSsV8">https://youtu.be/9X35rQMSsV8</a><br />----------------------<br /><br />For more information about Eric Ludy or the ministry of Ellerslie Mission Society, please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ellerslie.com/">https://ellerslie.com/</a> <br /><br />This message was originally given at the Church at Ellerslie on March 28, 2021{% endraw %}
