{% raw %}Way too many people focus on gear score aka expertise in New World. What you should be focusing on is the perks and stats on your equipment instead. In this video I show stat comparisons from very low gear score items to maxed out gear score to show that while it is better, it's so marginal that you're overspending gold and over committing time for paltry gains. New World's perk and stat system allows you to do most content in the game without &quot;bis&quot; gear like other MMO's.<br /><br />Before you scroll down to the comments and leave a salty response at least try to explain WHY you feel the way you do. Blanket statements without proof or explanation will be ignored. New World's perks are what makes character builds work and if you're just stacking 600 gear score &quot;dead weight&quot; items you're playing the game wrong.<br /><br /><br />If you want to play the game here's a link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World/</a><br /><br />ðŸ’¸Donate here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamlabs.com/swolebenji">https://streamlabs.com/swolebenji</a>  (Text to speech for $1 or more.)   <br />ðŸ’¬ Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/B39RsuNGz6">https://discord.gg/B39RsuNGz6</a><br /><br />#NewWorld #NewWorldGame #MMORPG{% endraw %}
