{% raw %}Do you want a convenient, effective, and useful blender and hydration flask? Here is a great product for you!<br /><br />Welcome back to Show And Tell with Peter Salib, a product showcase giving you the latest in tech gadgets and everything else you would want. Be sure to like, subscribe, and hit the notification bell for all things BOLD.<br /><br />Most people have some sort of blending appliance, whether its the Ninja or the Magic Bullet. The difference with this product is that the sleek design makes you think a company like Apple designed it.<br /><br />This Beast B10 Blender is perfect for smoothies, shakes, cocktails, mocktails, sauces, dips, and so on. It is a 1000 watt motor that powers 18,000 rpm (rotations per minute) for the blade. You just have to attach the blade to the specific size vessel you want and then just lock it into the base of the blender. There are sensors in the blender so that it can determine the necessary blade speed. It is going to make constant adjustments to maintain a constant speed and torque. <br /><br />The Beast B10 Blender does about 25 seconds of blending, then pauses to let the content settle, then starts again for another 20-second cycle, pauses, and then starts up again with a final 15 seconds of blending. This is what is called a smart one-minute controlled torque blend. The Beast B10 Blender also has a thermal safety shutoff at 140 degrees Fahrenheit. This is to ensure the blender doesn’t overheat and to protect the motor. Another safety mechanism is the lock function so that the blender cannot start unless the attachment is securely locked in. <br /><br />With the Beast B10 Blender, you are going to get two containers: the 500-milliliter vessel and the 1000-milliliter vessel. Both of the vessels are made out of Tritan plastic, which is strong, impact-resistant, BPA-free, and BPS-free. Obviously, the lids are leak-resistant. <br /><br />When it comes to the actual blending process, the creators behind the Beast B10 Blender, recommend that the vessel be filled to a third in liquid, then add your ice, fruits, powder, honey, or anything else.  <br /><br />Once you are done with the blending process, you can drink it right away, cap it off to save for later, or even take it as a to-go drink. <br /><br />You can also get a hydration flask, which is a hydration system. This flask is used to infuse your water with lemons, cucumbers, or any other fruits. It is a hydration flask with an infuser built-in. There’s a metal tin, put all your fruits in there, and then you can just put it right into the flask. <br /><br />The Beast B10 Blender and hydration flask are all together $185. If you were to purchase them separately, the Beast B10 Blender would be $155 and the hydration flask would be $38. <br /><br />Both the Beast B10 Blender and hydration flask are both sold on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thebeast.com/">https://thebeast.com/</a><br /><br />What do you think?
