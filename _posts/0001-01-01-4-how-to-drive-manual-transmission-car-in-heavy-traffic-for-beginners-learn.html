{% raw %}Learn how to clutch in and coast here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAQPhYAB9ok">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAQPhYAB9ok</a> : <br />One of the worst fears for people learning how to drive a standard transmission car is getting stuck in heavy traffic in the first 1 to 2 hours of learning or having to drive in heavy traffic everyday on their commute as a beginner. People always ask is there a trick to driving a stick shift in traffic and unfortunately there is none except for leaving yourself a lot of space to the cars ahead. <br />If in your automatic you usually leave 1 or 2 car lengths then with the manual you should try 4 or 5. If you don't and follow the car ahead very close when they brake you will have to brake when they stop you will have to stop. If you give yourself a lot of space then you can make your decisions how to coast, brake or press gas without having to worry about going too close to their bumper. <br />If the traffic is slowly moving along put it in 2nd gear as it will have lower amount of engine braking occurring at a low speed and RPM. If you keep it in first you will quickly see as you go faster and let off the gas the car will want to jerk and brake every time vs in 2nd where the car will coast. Then when you are going slightly faster try 3rd. Whatever gear allows you to coast with your foot off the gas without getting a lot of engine braking where the car wants to jerk and slow down. If you are worried about people cutting in front of you on your first day driving a stick.... well there is no trick, learn to drive.{% endraw %}
