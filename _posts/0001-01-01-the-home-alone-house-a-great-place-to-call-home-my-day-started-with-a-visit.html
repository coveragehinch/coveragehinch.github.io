{% raw %}My day started with a visit to one of the most iconic homes in America -- the Home Alone house.<br /><br /><br /><br />The home recently came on the market at a price of $2.4 million. It's in one of the North Shore's most attractive locations, a block from a lively strip of shops and restaurants, two blocks from the Metra station and Lake Michigan.<br /><br /><br /><br />Coldwell Banker's Marissa Hopkins was my tour guide as we focused on the house as a great place to call home.{% endraw %}
