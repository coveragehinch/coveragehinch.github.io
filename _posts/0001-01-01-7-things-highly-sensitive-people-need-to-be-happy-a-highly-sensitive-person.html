{% raw %}A highly sensitive person or HSP is someone who feels more deeply about things. A highly sensitive person is first researched by Dr. Elaine N. Aron in 1991. Do you tend to cry more easily, prefer alone time to recharge, and display higher empathy than others? You might be an HSP. Do you struggle to be happy? There are a plethora of tools and skills that can relieve the overstimulation HSPs experience every day. Here are just a few of those ideas! <br /><br />#hsp #highlysensitivepeople #highlysensitiveperson<br /><br />Writer: Gabrielle LaFrank<br />Script Editor: Morgan Franz<br />Script Manager: Kelly Soong <br />VO: Amanda Silvera <br />Animator: Alex (new animator) <br />YouTube Manager: Cindy Cheong <br /><br />References <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/9XMzM0Rs">https://pastebin.com/9XMzM0Rs</a><br /><br />Fretless by Kevin MacLeod<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3777-fretless">https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3777-fretless</a><br />License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br /><br />Would you like to support our Patreon?
