{% raw %}I've had some realisations about how to stay in our creative flow and indeed how I stay in mine. I'm sharing all the ways that I have found to keep me consistently AND creatively productive whilst also avoiding the dreaded burnout. No mean feat I know! I need to show up and get stuff done to run my small business but creativity doesn't just come on tap does it?! So, these are the things I do to help with that. Yes, there's a bit of discipline and dedication combined with creative breaks, resting and percolating! What things work for you? Let me know in the comments. Xxx With Biggest Loves, Wendy.
