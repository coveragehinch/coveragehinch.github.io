A former competitive wrestler, he splits his time between Vermont and Montreal.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />TRANSCRIPT:<br /><br />Question: Did you know from an early age that you would be a writer?<br /><br />John Irving: I supposed I had a number of what I might call pre-writing moments as a kid. I recognized at a pretty early age, certainly I was pre-teens, I noticed that the school day was enough of a day to spend with my friends. I seemed to have a need to want to be alone. Even before I started making almost landscape notes in a journal, even before I started keeping a journal, which happened to me when I was fourteen, even before then I had a need to come home from school by myself and to be in a room by myself or in my grandmother's garden by myself. I guess the earliest sign was how much I liked being alone, how much I actually needed to be alone, the way you need, or I need, exercise or food or a certain amount of sleep. There was that desire to be, and a comfort, at being alone.<br /><br />Recorded on: October 30, 2009<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />ABOUT BIG THINK:<br /><br />Smarter Faster‚Ñ¢<br />Big Think is the leading source of expert-driven, actionable, educational content -- with thousands of videos, featuring experts ranging from Bill Clinton to Bill Nye, we help you get smarter, faster.
