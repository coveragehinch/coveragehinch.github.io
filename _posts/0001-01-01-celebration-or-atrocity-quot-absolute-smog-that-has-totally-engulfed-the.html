{% raw %}&quot;... absolute smog that has totally engulfed the sky ... heard the growl of many animals at night as these firecrackers were going off … can you imagine this volume of atrocity to the Mother ‘Nature’? Who has given us right to do so?<br />... and I will certainly plead with each and every one to think more consciously and act more in harmony with the Nature. That's the only way we can guarantee our existence on this planet.&quot; NaamDeo{% endraw %}
