If you‚Äôre using another web hosting provider then you might find information related to nameservers in the details or information section which is usually located in your web hosting dashboard. You‚Äôll find two nameservers and you want to copy them both.<br /><br />‚óæ Access the dashboard of your domain name provider.<br /><br />Go to the dashboard of your domain name provider and go to the list of your domains. Locate the domain which you want to use with your web hosting.<br /><br />‚óæ Replace the nameservers of your domain<br /><br />The final step is to replace default nameservers with the ones you copied. Usually, you can find the nameservers of your domain in the settings section or in DNS management settings. Replace the nameservers and click save changes.<br /><br />Domain propagation can take up to 24 hours. That‚Äôs basically how long it takes until the domain is fully pointing to your web hosting.
