{% raw %}Hey friends join me today as  I count all my challenges that I have been saving since Jan 2020. This was the first time I  ever did these challenges. Hope you all enjoy it and don't forget to LIKE, COMMENT, and SUBSCRIBE. xoxo Mel<br /><br />PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS IS ME SHOWING YOU A FUN WAY TO SAVE, NOT MY INTENTIONS TO SAVE 400K IN 1 YEAR WITH THIS SAVING CHALLENGE LOL. OF COURSE I HAVE OTHER SAVINGS GOALS. BUT THIS IS FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR EXTRA CHANGE OR DO HAVE A LOW INCOME.

Match each week's savings amount with the number of the week in your challenge. In other words, you'll save $1 the first week, $2 the second week, $3 the third week, and so on until you put away $52 in week 52.<br /><br />Rollover: I use cash envelopes in my wallet,when it‚Äôs time to stuff my wallet again on a pay day, any leftover money I had from the previous pay week I take out and put it in my rollover envelope. <br /><br />üå∏Follow me on IG: mel_budgets<br /><br />üå∏ Cash App: $Melxoxo0<br />Try it using my code and you‚Äôll get $5.
