{% raw %}our clients had a problem. There lovely rear deck area &amp; outdoor living space was spoilt by an ugly concrete retaining wall...they asked us for ideas<br /><br />-we suggested hiding concrete wall with simple green-wall panels, not just attached to wall face, but wrapping over top of wall to create an illusion of a thicker 'hedge' rather than a green 'veneer'<br /><br />-the transformation was both startling &amp; immediate, the lush green-wall lifted the whole area, providing a wonderful, natural-looking transition from deck to gardens{% endraw %}
