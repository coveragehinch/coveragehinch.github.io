{% raw %}Today we have a guest join us on one of our 'us episodes', and we are very lucky to welcome Mathias Hasler to take part in the last section of today's podcast. Mathias is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Finance at Boston College, and his primary research focuses are empirical asset pricing, market efficiency, value investing, and corrections for data mining. In our chat with him today, we zoom in on a specific paper of his and its proposition about 'the six decisions' and their alternatives. Before we dive in with Mathias, we spend a little time with our usual round-up; looking at a new book by Hubert Joly, and fielding a very interesting listener question about value and investing in relation to green investments. Also, make sure to stay tuned for some thought-provoking Talking Sense cards with Mathias at the tail end of today's podcast. <br /><br />Book From Today’s Episode:<br />The Heart of Business — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/30ALyaX">https://amzn.to/30ALyaX</a> <br /><br />Links From Today’s Episode:<br />Rational Reminder on iTunes — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-rational-reminder-podcast/id1426530582.">https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-rational-reminder-podcast/id1426530582.</a> <br />Rational Reminder Website — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rationalreminder.ca/">https://rationalreminder.ca/</a> <br />Shop Merch — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.rationalreminder.ca/">https://shop.rationalreminder.ca/</a><br />Join the Community — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://community.rationalreminder.ca/">https://community.rationalreminder.ca/</a><br />Follow us on Twitter — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RationalRemind">https://twitter.com/RationalRemind</a><br />Follow us on Instagram — @rationalreminder<br />Benjamin on Twitter — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/benjaminwfelix">https://twitter.com/benjaminwfelix</a><br />Cameron on Twitter — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CameronPassmore">https://twitter.com/CameronPassmore</a><br />Mathias Hasler — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/haslermathias">https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/haslermathias</a><br />'Employee Satisfaction and Long-run Stock Returns, 1984-2020' — Employee Satisfaction and Long-run Stock Returns, 1984-2020 by Hamid Boustanifar, Young Dae Kang :: SSRN <br />'Dissecting Green Returns' — Dissecting Green Returns by Lubos Pastor, Robert F.
