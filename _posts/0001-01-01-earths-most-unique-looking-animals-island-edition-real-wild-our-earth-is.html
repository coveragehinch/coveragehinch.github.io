{% raw %}Our Earth is filled with picturesque and graceful creatures, but not every not every animal is as pleasing on the eye as the next.  In this episode of Worlds Weirdest Animals Faces, we explore some of Earth's more interesting looking looking creatures that live on islands. The Australian Short Beaked Echidna is visually similar to a porcupine but has a large snout with electro-sensors that can help sense prey underground.  In the Indonesian Archipelago, the Komodo dragon is the World's biggest lizard, reaching up to 3 meters and 70 kilos. It's got a forked tongues that can smell up to 10 km away. These animals might not be pretty, but they sure do have some unique features!<br /><br /><br />Click here for more documentaries: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2gSPaf6">http://bit.ly/2gSPaf6</a><br /><br />Follow us on Facebook: facebook.com/realwildschannel<br /><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/realwildchannel/">https://www.instagram.com/realwildchannel/</a><br /><br />Any queries, please contact us at: owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com<br /><br />#RealWild #Documentary{% endraw %}
