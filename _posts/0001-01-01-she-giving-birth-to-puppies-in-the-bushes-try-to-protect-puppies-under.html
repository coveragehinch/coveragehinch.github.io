{% raw %}She Giving Birth To Puppies in The Bushes, Try to Protect Puppies Under Heavy Rain Because The Owner Afraid of Dirtying<br /><br />We received a report of rescuing a mother dog and her baby living in a roadside bush. It was very dirty and dusty, with nothing to protect the puppies in the rain. The puppies are 20 days old, they begin their first steps. Therefore, they will face many dangers on the street. They need an emergency rescue. The mother dog is very friendly and close, She is a young and very cute mother. However, she is still suspicious and wary of everything, she tries to protect the puppies. A great mother. In the middle of the rescue, her Owner appeared. He won't let us take her away. He said, &quot;The mother dog gave birth to puppies here. It's all right? He wouldn't let her give birth at home for fear of dirt.&quot;<br /><br />Check out Facebook:<br />Acci√≥n Animal Ecuador<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Accionanimalecu">https://www.facebook.com/Accionanimalecu</a><br />donaciones@accionanimalecuador.org<br /><br /><br />Help more Animal click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2V6WWre">https://bit.ly/2V6WWre</a><br /><br />If there are any copyright issues with any videos posted here i will remove them. please contact my email: jamesruddypp@gmail.com<br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />#animalrescue, #rescuedog{% endraw %}
