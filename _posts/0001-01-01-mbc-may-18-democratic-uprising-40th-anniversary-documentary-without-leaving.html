{% raw %}May 18 Democratic Uprising 40th Anniversary Documentary<br /><br /><br />Without Leaving A Name Behind<br />Part1: We Were Gwangju<br /><br /><br />- World solidarity is in operation to help ‘lonely Gwangju’ <br />- <br />Without the coverage of German public broadcaster ARD-NDR reporter, Jurgen Hinzpeter, would the reality of Gwangju 40 years ago be well known? As was confirmed in the movie “Taxi Driver”, the truth of Gwangju may have been buried forever without the dedication and courage of foreign correspondent. However, how did Hinzpeter, who was staying in Tokyo at the time, come to Gwangju, where the May 18 Democratic Uprising was taking place? In the movie, a journalist’s intuition led him to Gwangju, but in reality, there was a decisive informer. <br /><br /><br />The decisive informant of Hinzpeter was the German Reverend Paul Schneiss. Reverend Schneiss, who has revealed the reality of the Yushin dictatorship since the 1970s and was a strong supporter of the Korean democracy movement, was forced to leave the country by the Park Chung-hee regime and stayed in Tokyo, Japan. However, after receiving a call from his wife who sensed the movement of the 5.17 military coup, he went to the Tokyo branch of the ARD broadcasting station where Hinzpeter was located. In addition, Reverend Schneiss played a role in receiving various statements and information from Gwangju, which was blocked by Chun Doo-hwan’s new army group, and spread it around the world. <br /><br /><br />It’s not only Reverend Schneiss. U.S. Peace Corps members who stayed at Gwangju during the May 18 Democratic Uprising should be remembered. David Dolinger, who was in charge of supporting foreign correspondents by translating and gathering news, testified to Gwangju MBC reporters that he witnessed the helicopter shooting of the May 18 Democratic Uprising, which is currently a controversial issue. Dolinger is also a witness who attended the last foreign press conference of the resistance leadership, which had been veiled, and heard Yoon Sang-won’s last comment.{% endraw %}
