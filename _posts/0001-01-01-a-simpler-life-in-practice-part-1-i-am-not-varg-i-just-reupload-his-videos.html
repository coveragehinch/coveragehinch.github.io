I have NO EXPENSES when I make these videos. I only invest my time in them, and my love for my heritage of course. And I do so with pleasure. Trying to save our heritage is my objective, not to make money by pretending to do so. <br /><br />If you want to support me some way, you can (and get something in return when you do) by buying my pro-European books from here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Varg-Vikernes/e/B00IVZ2KPO/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1">https://www.amazon.com/Varg-Vikernes/e/B00IVZ2KPO/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1</a>{% endraw %}
