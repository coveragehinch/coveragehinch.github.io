{% raw %}#suzukign250 #suzukign250cc #bikescrapyard<br />I found this old Suzuki GN 250cc on Scrap yard. It was broken and leaking but there was something special about it that drew me in, so I decided to fix it up and give it a budget bike make over. <br /><br />#Suzuki_GN250cc<br />#Suzuki_GN_250<br />#Suzuki_GN_250cc<br />#suzuki_scrapyard<br />#scrapyard<br />#auctionsbike<br />#auctions.<br />#motorcycle_scrapyard<br />#motorbike_scrapyard<br /><br /><br />There are many Places in Pakistan and India in which people can purchased a dead bike from scrapyard and then restored it. <br />This seems a cheaper option than buying a new one.<br /><br />Please let me know and leave a message in a comment box if you need a location of such bike scrapyards in in Pakistan, especially in Punjab Lahore<br /><br />Please Like,Share And Subscribe This Channel If You like This Video.{% endraw %}
