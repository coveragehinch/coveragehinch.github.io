{% raw %}A few hours trotting on the Wye was curtailed somewhat by a rather unfortunate incident...<br /><br />Thanks for watching and I hope you enjoy the film.<br /><br />This channel is my angling video diary with every single session being filmed.  Some sessions are successful but, as it's fishing, some are less so.  You will see everything as it happened on the day, be it good or bad.<br /><br />A huge thanks goes to John Cain, Richard Bawcombe, Nick S and Adam Arnold for their generous support of Avon Angling UK through Patreon.
