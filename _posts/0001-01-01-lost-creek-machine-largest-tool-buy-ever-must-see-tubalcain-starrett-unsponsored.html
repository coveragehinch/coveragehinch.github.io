{% raw %}UNSPONSORED VIDEO<br />I recently visited LOST CREEK MACHINERY in Ottawa, IL.   The owners had just recently made their largest buy ever of quality tools.  These tools came from a collector that had an ENORMOUS accumulation of machinist tools.  The showroom is so loaded with machines &amp; tools, it is actually mind blowing &amp; overwhelming.<br />Join me as I run the camera thru their shop in a frenzy of excitement .
