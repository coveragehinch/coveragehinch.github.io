(09:00)<br /><br />The disparity Loop visualizes disparity of the Elements. If an element is at its original position, the distance from the center is max. if it is far away from its original index the distance from the center is 0.<br />Keep in mind that in this example we look at the array as if the beginning and the end is connected. So the distance between the 2nd element and the last is not n-2, but 2. <br /><br />Important information: The array is beeing shuffled in reverse.<br /><br /><br />Algorithm Timecodes:<br />00:02 Radix Sort (Base 10)<br />00:19 Gravity Sort (Bead)<br />00:33 Shell Sort<br />00:58 Merge Sort<br />01:27 Heap Sort<br />01:25 Odd Even Sort<br />02:40 Comb Sort<br />03:07 Double Selection Sort<br />03:20 Pigeonhole Sort<br />04:06 Selection Sort<br />04:26 Quick Sort (Pivot Middle)<br />04:34 Quick Sort (Double Pivot)<br />04:44 Cycle Sort<br />05:01 American Flag Sort<br />05:20 Counting Sort<br />05:35 Bucket Sort<br />05:46 Cocktail Shaker Sort<br />06:30 Bubble Sort<br />07:16 Insertion Sort<br />08:00 Gnome Sort<br />09:00 COMPARISON TABLE<br /><br />Measurements explained: <br />As &quot;Comparison&quot; counts the comparison of a value from the Array with any other value.<br />As &quot;Segment&quot; counts every sorted part of the array.<br />&quot;Real Time&quot; corresponds to the measured time only used for the algorithm.<br />As &quot;Swap&quot; counts the exchange between the indexes of two elements of the array.<br />As &quot;Write to the Main Array&quot; counts the change of a value in the Array.<br /><br />Please put your wished and questions in the comments.  :){% endraw %}
