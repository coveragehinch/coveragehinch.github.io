{% raw %}Dev, along with many other content creators, is a little disenchanted with the standard slog. It's not like Eldraine, a format that was filled to the brim with 10/10 cards and overpowered decks; no, instead it's something much worse: it's boring. Bas aren't always the best thing for a format, but sometimes they can make things feel fresh again, if only for just a little while. So today, we'll cover five cards that don't necessarily need to be banned, but if they WERE banned, Dev wouldn't care at all. <br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/SBMTG">https://www.patreon.com/SBMTG</a><br /><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sbmtgdev">https://www.twitch.tv/sbmtgdev</a><br /><br />Deck Tech - Rakdos Superfriends: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTpluJVRdGk&amp;t=65s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTpluJVRdGk&amp;t=65s</a><br /><br />Ranked Jank - Abzan Laid to Rest Humans: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzq_Xxyovcw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzq_Xxyovcw</a><br /><br />Strictly Better Mtg is a Magic: the Gathering Channel that does videos on everything Magic the Gathering.
