{% raw %}Educational video for children to learn what non-renewable energy sources are, which are their main properties and what types of energies exist. Non-renewable energy resources are limited and don't replenish naturally. Oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear energy are some examples of non-renewable energy sources. In this video, children will discover the disadvantages of non-renewable energy sources as contrasted with renewable energy sources: non-renewable energies emit contaminating gases and sometimes create radioactive residues or even natural disasters. To contribute in looking after the environment, it is important to reduce the use of non-renewable energy resources. <br /><br />Thanks for visiting us!
