{% raw %}For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.<br />Your generous donations help us continue our important work of serving, educating and evangelizing the world through classic Catholic books/videos and sound Catholic doctrine. The content on this channel is not being monetized. If you want to help our not-for-profit apostolate, please do so via PayPal using the following link: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/classiccatholicaudio">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/classiccatholicaudio</a><br />Please consider making a one-time donation or a recurring monthly donation. It is only through ongoing donations like yours that we can continue this mission for the glory of GOD. Your donations, big and small, help us transform lives, inspire meaning and purpose, and build a better world. Thank you very much for your generous support! May the LORD JESUS CHRIST bless you forever!<br />We credit the original writers/speakers/creators of the books/sermons/videos and the following websites (whenever it applies): ewtn.com, marian.org, thedivinemercy.org, jmjsite.com, sensustraditionis.org, wikipedia.org, librivox.org,  traditionalcatholicsermons.org (and any other website or source that we may have forgotten to credit in this description) as the source materials we use here and in numerous previous audiobooks/sermons/videos.<br />Please pray for them and, if possible, donate to them too. Also, for great book reviews and summaries of Catholic books go to BiblicalBookworm at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNK8idu2htmLhDYQ7WpQJcA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNK8idu2htmLhDYQ7WpQJcA</a><br />All we desire is to spread and preach the Good News to whoever wants to listen. The gospel of JESUS CHRIST is the best news anyone will ever hear, and what a person does with this news will determine where he or she spends eternity. GOD is calling you to choose life. Call on the name of the LORD JESUS CHRIST and be saved. For GOD so loved the world that HE gave the only begotten SON, so that everyone believing in HIM may not perish, but may have eternal life.<br />All these audiobooks, lectures/talks, sermons/homilies, speeches/discourses, conferences/ discussions and treatises that we upload frequently to this channel are also useful and convenient for people with vision loss or no vision. Our audiobooks help people who are visually impaired, with vision loss, or no vision by enriching their knowledge and providing them with information, instruction and spiritual/religious education on different subjects through the means of a book that is in the audible format. Many who are blind or visually impaired—or who have reading or other physical disabilities and visual problems (dyslexia, migraine, eye floaters, diplopia, etc.)—often cannot use printed resources, depriving them of reading materials that most of us take for granted. Therefore, we provide free Catholic, religious, and/or educational audiobooks for those people with low vision to no vision.<br />We do not monetize any of our videos. if you see ads running on our videos, it is because the original owners (who gave us permission to upload them) want to monetize them, not us. All the books and other works that we publish on this channel are in the public domain or the owners gave us permission to upload them. If we made a mistake, and you see intellectual property that belongs to you, please let us know via the email that we provided in the about section of our channel, and we will immediately take it down.<br />Please subscribe to our channel, like our videos, and share them. Please pray for us, for the conversion of souls, and for the souls in purgatory. Long live CHRIST the King! May the grace of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, the love of GOD, and the fellowship of the HOLY SPIRIT be with you always. To JESUS Through Mary, His Immaculate Mother. Amen!<br />Thank you and many blessings from GOD!<br />CHRISTUS Vincit! CHRISTUS Regnat! CHRISTUS Imperat!{% endraw %}
