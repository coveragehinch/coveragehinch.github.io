That's weird.'&quot;<br /><br />Over the next several months, the 37-year-old watched as a growing chorus of businesses said they couldn't find anyone to hire because of government stimulus money. It was so ubiquitous that he joined a &quot;No one wants to work&quot; Facebook group, where users made memes deriding frustrated employers.<br /><br />He said he found it hard to believe that government money was keeping people out of the labor force, especially when the end of expanded federal unemployment benefits did not seem to trigger a surge in employment. All expanded benefits ended in September, but 26 states – including Florida – ended them early in June and July.<br /><br />&quot;If this extra money that everyone's supposedly living off of stopped in June and it's now September, obviously, that's not what's stopping them,&quot; he said. Workers have said companies struggling to hire aren't offering competitive pay and benefits.<br /><br />So Holz, a former food-service worker and charter-boat crewman, decided to run an experiment.<br /><br />On September 1, he sent job applications to a pair of restaurants that had been particularly public about their staffing challenges.<br /><br />Then, he widened the test and spent the remainder of the month applying to jobs — mostly at employers vocal about a lack of workers — and tracking his journey in a spreadsheet.”<br /><br />#TheDamageReport #JohnIadarola #TheYoungTurks{% endraw %}
