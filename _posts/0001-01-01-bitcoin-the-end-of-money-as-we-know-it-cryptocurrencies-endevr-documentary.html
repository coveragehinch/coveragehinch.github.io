{% raw %}Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It | Cryptocurrencies | Business Documentary from 2015<br /><br />Bitcoin: The End Of Money As We Know It traces the history of money from the bartering societies of the ancient world to the trading floors of Wall St. The documentary exposes the practices of central banks and the dubious financial actors who brought the world to its knees in the last crisis. It highlights the Government's influence on the money creation process and how it causes inflation. Moreover, this film explains how most money we use today is created out of thin air by banks when they create debt. Epic in scope, this film examines the patterns of technological innovation and questions everything you thought you knew about money. Is Bitcoin an alternative to national currencies backed by debt? Will Bitcoin and cryptocurrency spark a revolution in how we use money peer to peer? Is it a gift to criminals? Or is it the next bubble waiting to burst? If you trust in your money just as it is - this film has news for you.<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Subscribe ENDEVR for free: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG">https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG</a><br />Join the club and become a Patron: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary">https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG">https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/endevrdocs/">https://www.instagram.com/endevrdocs/</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />#FreeDocumentary #ENDEVR #Bitcoin<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />ENDEVR explains the world we live in through high-class documentaries, special investigations, explainers videos and animations.
