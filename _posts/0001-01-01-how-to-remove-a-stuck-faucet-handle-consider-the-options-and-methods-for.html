{% raw %}Consider the options and methods for removing the handle, flywheel, lever from the faucet mixer.<br />At the most inopportune moment, when the faucet needs to replace the cartridge or shutoff valve, problems arise when removing the handle from the faucet. The cause of this problem is oxidation or the so-called &quot;souring&quot; of the handle on the rod, which in turn does not allow the mixer to be disassembled during repair and creates additional difficulties.<br />Be sure to treat the threaded and mounting seats of the mixer with special grease and perhaps then such problems would not have occurred the next time you replaced it. #remove_faucet_handle #faucet_repair #remove_faucet_mixer_handle  #CleverBill #DIY<br /><br />Music:<br />Composition - A Rising Wave<br />Artist - Jeremy Blake{% endraw %}
