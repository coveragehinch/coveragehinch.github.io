{% raw %}A cheeky extra event vlog for you guys!!! It was a little bit of a fail but we did bring it back for the XC!! So it wasn’t our best event on paper however after a couple of bad runs for Max and I it was all about getting back out there and having a confident run XC which was exactly what we got!!! <br /><br />Enjoy this last event vlog until the 2022 season begins next March! <br /><br />We also have some exciting news and have brought merch out so please take a look (link below) <br /><br />I really hope you like the vlog it’s definitely a good one.
