{% raw %}Imagine a world free of genetic diseases, where parents control their offspring's height, eye color and intelligence.  The science may be closer than you think.  Genes interact in ways that we don't fully understand and there could be unintended consequences, new diseases that result from our tinkering.  But even if the science could be perfected, is it morally wrong?  Would it lead to eugenics and a stratified society where only the rich enjoy the benefits of genetic enhancement?  Or would the real injustice be depriving our children of every scientifically possible opportunity?<br /><br />For: Sheldon Krimsky<br />For: Lord Robert Winston<br /><br />Against: Nita Farahany<br />Against: Lee Silver<br /><br />===================================<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/IQ2onYouTube">http://bit.ly/IQ2onYouTube</a> <br /><br />Official site: iq2us.org/vote   <br /><br />IQ2US Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/IQ2Twitter">http://bit.ly/IQ2Twitter</a> <br /><br />IQ2US Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/IQ2onFacebook">http://bit.ly/IQ2onFacebook</a><br />==================================={% endraw %}
