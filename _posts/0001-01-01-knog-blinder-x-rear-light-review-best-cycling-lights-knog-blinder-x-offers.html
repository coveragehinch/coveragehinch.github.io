{% raw %}Knog Blinder X offers a lot of features that other lights do not. The light comes with an integrated USB plug, which means you donâ€™t have to deal with USB cables. The battery life is outstanding and lasts 2.5 hours on the highest output mode and up to 60 hours on an eco-friendly one. It also includes a low battery life indicator so you know when it is time to charge. <br /><br />5 Best Front Bike Lights For Commuting: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bikedriven.com/accessories/5-best-front-bike-lights-for-urban-cycling-commuting-and-training-500-700-lumens/">https://bikedriven.com/accessories/5-best-front-bike-lights-for-urban-cycling-commuting-and-training-500-700-lumens/</a><br /><br />7 Best Bike Light Sets (Front and Rear): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bikedriven.com/accessories/7-best-bike-light-sets-front-and-rear/">https://bikedriven.com/accessories/7-best-bike-light-sets-front-and-rear/</a><br /><br />7 Best Rear Bike Lights For Cyclists: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bikedriven.com/accessories/7-best-rear-bike-lights/">https://bikedriven.com/accessories/7-best-rear-bike-lights/</a><br /><br />5 Best Mountain Bike Lights: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bikedriven.com/accessories/5-best-mountain-bike-lights/">https://bikedriven.com/accessories/5-best-mountain-bike-lights/</a><br /><br />5 Best Front Bike Lights For Night Riding (1100-1300 Lumens): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bikedriven.com/accessories/5-best-front-bike-lights-for-night-riding-1100-1300-lumens/">https://bikedriven.com/accessories/5-best-front-bike-lights-for-night-riding-1100-1300-lumens/</a><br /><br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bikedriven.com/">https://bikedriven.com/</a> for more cycling-related product reviews.<br /><br />Buy here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/us/en/knog-blinder-x-rear-light/rp-prod199567">https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/us/en/knog-blinder-x-rear-light/rp-prod199567</a>{% endraw %}
