{% raw %}The Hate That Hate Produced is a television documentary about Black Nationalism in America, focusing on the Nation of Islam and, to a lesser extent, the United African Nationalist Movement. It was produced in 1959 by Mike Wallace and Louis Lomax.<br /><br />In 1959, Wallace and Lomax were television journalists for News Beat, a program on WNTA-TV in New York. Lomax told Wallace about the Nation of Islam, and Wallace became interested in the group. Lomax, who was African American, was given rare access to the organization. Accompanied by two white camera operators, Lomax conducted interviews with the Nation's leaders and filmed some of its events. The Hate That Hate Produced was broadcast in five parts during the week of July 13â€“17, 1959, and was repeated several days later.<br /><br />#####<br />Reelblack's mission is to educate, elevate, entertain, enlighten, and empower through Black film.
