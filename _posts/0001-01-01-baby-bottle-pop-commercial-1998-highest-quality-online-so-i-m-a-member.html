{% raw %}So, I'm a member of the Lost Media Wiki community, and they have unearthed many rare things from the Internet Archive's &quot;Understanding 9/11&quot; page, from high quality versions of popular PBS bumpers to full episodes of rare shows like Tots TV and The Noddy Shop. One user found out that like PBS, UPN did not pre-empt their kids' programming and showed episodes of Disney cartoons. On one of the breaks of Buzz Lightyear, the Baby Bottle Pop ad appeared as the first ad in the highest quality I have seen for that particular commercial (this was recorded via DVR), so I decided to upload it here.{% endraw %}
