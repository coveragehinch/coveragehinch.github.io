{% raw %}导演柯文思：<br />    纪录片《柴米油盐之上》讲述的是有关“小康”的四个故事。小康社会不光只是消除贫困，更是让身在其中的每个中国人，都能充分发挥潜能，有机会实现自己的梦想。“小康”是有关“中国梦”的追求和实现。每一个中国人都从中得益，中国也正变成一个更加公平和宜居的国家。<br />    我们的系列片始于中国的西部山区，一路穿越，直到中国的东部沿海。我们遇到来自不同背景的中国人，他们的共同点是曾经都非常贫困。他们的故事呈现出“小康”的四个阶段。观众能从四集故事的主人公身上，看到“小康”是如何发挥魔力，并改变他们的人生的。<br />    第一集讲述了住在深山里的一家贫困户，他们的生活因为“小康”的政策而得到改变。他们得以搬离大山，开始在城镇的新生活 。第二集讲了一个正在奋斗路上的女孩的故事。作为一个有雄心壮志的中国女性，观众能看到她为改变自己命运而付出的努力，以及遭遇的困难和挣扎。第三集的主人公是一个已经走出农村并在城市扎根的杂技演员。某种程度上来说他实现了“中国梦” ，但他也很清楚他的家人为此付出了怎样的牺牲和代价。第四集讲了一批从农村走出来，抓住机遇先富起来的企业家们。如今他们正筹划用头脑和资源让留在村里的人也能共享发展的果实。<br />    “小康”改善了中国人的生活水平，人们不必搬去上海北京这些大城市，无论选择身居何处，在全面建成的小康社会里，他们都能享有更富足的生活。“小康”是一个超出所有人预期的成功的政策，我想这对于中国来说是件好事。我希望你们能喜欢这部纪录片。<br /><br />Malcolm Clarke, a British director in the film industry for over 40 years, has been good at projecting a panoramic view of society with individual stories, reflecting the relationship between the great times and the fate of ordinary people, and showing a strong spiritual core in short films.<br /><br />&quot;The serial documentary A Long Cherished Dream tells four stories about the ‘moderately prosperous’ society, which means both eliminating poverty and enabling every Chinese to realize their dreams.&quot; The director described.<br /><br />A Long Cherished Dream consists of four episodes: A Room of Their Own, Drive Like A Girl, Leap of Faith and The Tie That Binds. Malcolm Clarke adopted an objective and level approach, and told stories of pursuing moderate prosperity. Since the film was premiered in China, it has gained over 2.9 million views. The film will be broadcast on UK Sky TV and Discovery Channel Southeast Asia in August and October respectively.<br /><br />The first episode records that a village cadre in poverty-stricken villages helped poor households relocate from mountains and start new lives.<br /><br />The second episode shifts the perspective to female power in China’s development. Zhang Lin, a female truck driver, is not a natural feminist, but an out-and-out action taker. With her own strength, she made her way from a small village to a big city.<br /><br />In the eyes of westerners, China has the best acrobats, but few know how difficult it is for older acrobats to make breakthroughs. The third episode focuses on this special profession, and tells the story of the hero's ladder climbing through self-reliance.<br /><br />The film finale shows audience the possibility of &quot;moderately prosperity&quot;, and records the arduous process of three founders of the largest Chinese express delivery enterprise.<br /><br />The 120-minute film only presents part of the history of China's changes. &quot;Moderately prosperity&quot; is a successful policy exceeding world expectations. It improves the living standards of Chinese and gives them the opportunity to live happily and pursue their dreams despite of origin or descent.{% endraw %}
