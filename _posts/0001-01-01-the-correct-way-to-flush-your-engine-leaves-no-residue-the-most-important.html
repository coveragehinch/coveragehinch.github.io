{% raw %}The most important step after chemically flushing your engine oil is to change the oil and filter again, run the engine for 10 minutes and then drain. This second oil change is to remove any remaining engine flush chemicals and dirty oil circulating in the engine to avoid contaminating your new oil. <br /><br />Liqui Moly Pro-Line Engine Flush:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3o93BMP">https://amzn.to/3o93BMP</a><br /><br />Mobil 1 Extended Performance High Mileage Full Synthetic Oil: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3exKtFg">https://amzn.to/3exKtFg</a><br /><br />In this video I will show you how dirty the second oil flush is after the initial engine flush with Liqui-Moly.
