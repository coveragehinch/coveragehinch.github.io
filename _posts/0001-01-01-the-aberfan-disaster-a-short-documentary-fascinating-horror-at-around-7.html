{% raw %}At around 7:30am on the 21st of October 1966 workers arriving at the site of a coal mine near the village of Aberfan in Wales discovered that one of several spoil heaps on site had shifted during the night. Supervisors called a halt to any work that day, and began to assess the damage. They were still doing so at 9:15am, when a huge amount of material broke away from the heap and flowed downhill in a giant wave, directly towards the village below.<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery. Fascinating Horror is all about in-depth research, respectful storytelling, and learning what we can from the mistakes of the past. You might be surprised to discover just how much of today's world is shaped by long-forgotten disasters from decades gone by.<br /><br />Music: &quot;Emotional Aftermath&quot; by Doug Maxwell/Media Right Productions<br /><br />► Like, comment and subscribe to keep up with my latest videos<br />► Know of an incident I should cover?
