{% raw %}Secret Mallorca | Vanlife Spain<br /><br />In this van life video, we explore the lesser-known spots on the island. We always thought of Mallorca as just beach resorts so we explore the Spanish island in search of a variety of landscapes. This video is a Mallorca travel guide for some of the best nature spots on the island. Our personal favorites were Sa Colabra &amp; Boquer Valley. <br /><br />⭐ N.rit mask<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/N-RIT-Cooling-Gaiter-Breathable-Bandanas/dp/B08NSTNJ91/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&amp;keywords=n.rit&amp;qid=1633652180&amp;sr=8-7">https://www.amazon.com/N-RIT-Cooling-Gaiter-Breathable-Bandanas/dp/B08NSTNJ91/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&amp;keywords=n.rit&amp;qid=1633652180&amp;sr=8-7</a><br /><br />We love it for a number of reasons, it's small, compact, bacteria-free, and most importantly cooling! <br /><br />⭐Hike<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/spain/illes-balears/valle-boquer">https://www.alltrails.com/trail/spain/illes-balears/valle-boquer</a><br /><br />⭐Patreon<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/travelbeans">https://www.patreon.com/travelbeans</a><br /><br />⭐ Come Say Hello!<br />▹Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/TravelBeans">https://facebook.com/TravelBeans</a><br />▹Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/travel_beans">https://instagram.com/travel_beans</a> <br /><br />⭐ EQUIPMENT WE USE:<br />Our Drone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beansdrone">https://geni.us/beansdrone</a><br />Our Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beanscamera">https://geni.us/beanscamera</a><br />Our Lenses: <br />Wide - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beansmainlens">https://geni.us/beansmainlens</a><br />Tight - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beanslonglens">https://geni.us/beanslonglens</a><br />Microphone - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beansmic">https://geni.us/beansmic</a><br />GoPro - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beansgopro">https://geni.us/beansgopro</a><br />Small Tripod - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beanstripod1">https://geni.us/beanstripod1</a><br />Big Tripod - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beanstripod2">https://geni.us/beanstripod2</a><br />Laptop - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/beanslaptop">https://geni.us/beanslaptop</a><br /><br />⭐ SERVICES WE USE:<br />▹Where We Find Our Music (Epidemic Sound) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/travelbeans">http://share.epidemicsound.com/travelbeans</a><br />▹Helpful YouTube Tools (TubeBuddy) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/TRAVELBEANS">https://www.tubebuddy.com/TRAVELBEANS</a><br /><br />▹Teach English Online &amp; Earn Money - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cambly.com/en/tutors?referralCode=emma145">https://www.cambly.com/en/tutors?referralCode=emma145</a><br /><br />▹Travel + Medical Insurance For Nomads (SafetyWing) *Now Includes COVID-19 Coverage*<br />Nomad Insurance: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.safetywing.com/?referenceID=24739299">https://www.safetywing.com/?referenceID=24739299</a><br />Remote Health: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://safetywing.com/remote-health?referenceID=24739299">https://safetywing.com/remote-health?referenceID=24739299</a><br /><br />▹SkyRoam Personal WiFi - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.skyroam.com/?rfsn=2382845.b5fb86">https://www.skyroam.com/?rfsn=2382845.b5fb86</a><br /><br />NOTE: Some of these may be affiliate links, which means when you buy something we may receive a small commission.

On this channel, you’ll find a variety of travel and vlog content, in which you’ll see us in places like Thailand, Japan, USA, Slovenia, and more.<br /><br />In 2017 we left home with just £500 in our bank account and a dream to make a sustainable travel lifestyle happen! We are now living our dream as digital nomads and want to inspire you to create your own story, whatever it may be!<br /><br />After 5 years of aimless, yet enjoyable, backpacking around the world we found ourselves in New York City battling with depression. At this point, we decided to go home and confront this problem head-on. After 6 tough months at home we decided to go away again, but this time with a goal in mind.. to turn travel into a lifestyle.<br /><br />Our time spent battling depression has influenced our outlook on life dramatically! We are now traveling the world in search of what makes us happy. In our vlogs, we talk openly and honestly about our travel experiences, the digital nomad life and depression. We hope our videos can help to inspire you to create a life that makes you happy!<br /><br />⭐ Make sure to Subscribe to our channel for more videos like this one! ⭐{% endraw %}
