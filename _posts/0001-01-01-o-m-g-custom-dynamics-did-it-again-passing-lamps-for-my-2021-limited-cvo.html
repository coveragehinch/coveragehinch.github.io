This process will make power to the rear wheel available to the rider immediately when the clutch is opened up. There’s no need for the rider to be concerned with twisting the throttle for power because it’s already PRELOADED.<br /><br />If you would like to support the &quot;Robert Simmons - Paying It Forward&quot; channel, a monetary donation can be sent via “Zelle” or “Venmo” to:<br />paying_it_forward_rs@aol.com<br /><br />You can also send donations via PayPal by clicking on the following link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?business=T67FSQ88VR3KG&amp;currency_code=USD">https://www.paypal.com/donate?business=T67FSQ88VR3KG&amp;currency_code=USD</a><br /><br />If you would like to send me anything else, please feel free to send it to:<br />Robert Simmons - Paying It Forward<br />101 Blue Moon Crossing, Suite 3, Box 134<br />Pooler, GA 31322<br /><br />Merchandise (MERCH)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://teespring.com/stores/robert-simmons-preload">http://teespring.com/stores/robert-simmons-preload</a>  <br /><br />Interested in PRIVATE LESSONS?
