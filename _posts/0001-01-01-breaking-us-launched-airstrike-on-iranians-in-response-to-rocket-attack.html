{% raw %}Breaking! US Launched Airstrike on Iranians in Response to Rocket Attack! Biden Blames Israel!<br />After the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, the tension in the region increased with the intervention of the USA, and the Iranian-backed militants carried out a heavy attack on the US base with 5 missiles yesterday.<br /><br />Iran's attacks, which have been taking precautions against the US activity in the region for a long time, have always been to end the US presence.<br />Iran-backed militants, who blame the United States for the latest Israeli attacks, swore revenge.<br />It was reported by NY Times that Iran's last two major attacks on US bases were a response to Israel's attacks.<br />Although one of the Israeli missiles was blocked by the Syrian defense, the Israeli missiles, which were not blocked, hit their target with full accuracy and destroyed the shipment of Iranian-backed militants.<br />Citing officials familiar with the behind-the-scenes discussion between Washington and Jerusalem, as the US continues to try and bring Iran back into the nuclear deal, the report said that Israeli officials have dismissed the warnings, saying they have “no intention of letting up.”<br />The IAEA has been unable to access surveillance footage of Iranian nuclear sites or of online enrichment monitors and electronic seals since February. The agency’s chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, told The Associated Press this month that the situation was like “flying in a heavily clouded sky.”<br />The US envoy said he was not encouraged by the statements from the new Iranian government of President Ebrahim Raisi, which earlier on Friday accused Washington of conducting a “propaganda campaign” against the country.{% endraw %}
