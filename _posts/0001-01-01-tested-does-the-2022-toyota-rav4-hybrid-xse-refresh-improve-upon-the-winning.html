{% raw %}I get my hands on and drive the new 2022 refreshed rav4 hybrid. Incredible fuel economy from a crossover is hard to come by - but not in the Rav4 hybrid. Here are my first impressions. <br /><br />More info:<br />For 2022, the RAV4 is getting some enticing updates, including a new SE Hybrid grade as well as some exterior and interior updates across all grades.<br /><br />Designed for customers looking for sporty performance and sporty style but at a lower price compared to the XSE, the new SE Hybrid grade for RAV4 includes mono-tone paint, fabric trimmed seats and a 7-inch touchscreen with six speakers. And the SE Hybrid grade‚Äôs available options are exceptional, as well as smartly packaged. The weather package is a commuter‚Äôs dream, offering a heated leather steering wheel, heated front seats and rain-sensing windshield wipers with a de-icer function. The convenience package includes a moonroof, height adjustable power liftgate and not to mention, Audio Plus that upgrades to a 9-inch touchscreen.<br /><br />RAV4 gets some enticing exterior and interior features across all grades when it goes on sale next month. The RAV4 XSE gets a bold new color in Cavalry Blue with a black roof. In fact, Cavalry Blue will also make its way on the new SE Hybrid grade, as well as the existing TRD Off-Road.<br /><br />There are quite a few updates to the wheels as well. LE Hybrid, XLE and XLE Hybrid get a new color for their wheels, as does the Adventure grade. While the XLE Premium Hybrid and Limited Hybrid get a new design, as does the XSE Hybrid.<br /><br />XLE grades and above get updated headlamps ‚Äì both for style and for capability improvement. New LED foglamps are being introduced for XLE Premium, Limited, Adventure and TRD Off Road.  And the XSE Hybrid gets the super sleek vertical lights that debuted on the XSE Prime in 2021.<br /><br />Interior updates are also found across multiple grades:<br /><br />Locking glove box and LED interior lamps added to all grades.<br />XLE and above get illuminated interior switches.<br />Limited grade gets an 8-way power passenger seat.<br />More details on the 2022 RAV4, including pricing, will be released in mid-December<br /><br />JOIN for exclusive Luxurious Fleet perks and features!<br />‚≠ê<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXPVB7s1TJTE0WjDpakGp5Q/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXPVB7s1TJTE0WjDpakGp5Q/join</a><br /><br />Visit my stores for Luxurious merch!<br />‚≠êAmazon Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/kirkkreifels">https://www.amazon.com/shop/kirkkreifels</a><br />‚≠êTeespring Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/kirks-lexurious-fleet">https://teespring.com/stores/kirks-lexurious-fleet</a><br /><br /><br />Kirk's Social Media:<br />üì∑ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kirk_kreifels/">https://www.instagram.com/kirk_kreifels/</a><br />üê¶ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/kirkkreifels">https://twitter.com/kirkkreifels</a><br /><br />üéµMusic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/uniqofficial">https://soundcloud.com/uniqofficial</a><br />üéµMusic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.teknoaxe.com/">http://www.teknoaxe.com/</a>{% endraw %}
