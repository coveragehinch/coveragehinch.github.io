{% raw %}WHEN THINGS DON'T GO THE WAY YOU HOPED. (waste of time?)  And being a  VAN LIFE COUPLE can be TOUGH!<br /><br />So we have been travelling around the south of France for six weeks now, and aside from the odd near miss with the drone and getting stuck in the mud, European campervan travel has been going pretty well so far.<br /><br />However, this week I go off on a little solo female adventure that just doesn't go the way I want it to, on top of that there's a few issues that come with living in a tiny home that we discuss. <br />We like to be as honest as we can with you and we often worry that we are only giving you the good stuff, when in reality there are times when being a female van life couple can be tough.<br /><br />The week is still a good one though, we find an amazing park up in the mountains, next to the stunning French town of Gourdon, there's a trip to Ste Marguerite island (the largest of the Lecrins islands in the south of France) and we find some waterfalls in a French gorge as well!<br /><br />Van life in Europe has its ups and downs for sure, but so far the ups of travelling around the world in our self converted campervan are far out weighing the downs! Our time travelling in France is coming to a close for 2021, I hope you all join us to see what country we are going to next!<br /><br />Hopefully you are enjoying this European travel series as much as we are and we are managing to show you just some of the stunning landscapes that France has to offer in this French travel vlog. <br />As usual, we have tried to include a bit of everything, some cinematic scenery mixed with our usual female van life foolery, we always love hearing what you lot think in the comments so do let us know, and as always, thank you for watching!<br /><br />Follow us on our journey as we attempt to create a proper YouTube travel series as we, two female travelers and vanlifers, attempt to travel across Europe in our rolling tiny home.<br />Hit the subscribe button to see where our DIY campervan takes us next and how this van life couple copes living in a van!<br /><br />Check out our instagram for real time updates..<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/camper_vibe/">https://www.instagram.com/camper_vibe/</a><br /><br />Have a look at emily's blog for her thoughts on all things van..<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://campervibe.co.uk/">http://campervibe.co.uk/</a><br />(this is also where you will find all our park ups and list of our film making gear)<br /><br />For stickers go to the website or..<br />Make a Â£5.00 payment to <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/campervibe">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/campervibe</a><br />and just leave your name and full address in the notes, just click add note.<br />If paypal confuses you (as it does me, Lou) then follow the below instructions;<br />Use your name as the reference then, email <br />campervibe6@gmail.com <br />with the same name as your reference of payment and full address.<br />The stickers will then be shipped out, thanks again for your support :-)<br /><br />*We use affiliate links from which we earn a small percentage at no extra cost to yourself.
