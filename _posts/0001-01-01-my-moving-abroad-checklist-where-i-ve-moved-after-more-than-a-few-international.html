{% raw %}After more than a few international moves, I've come up with a moving abroad checklist that works for me and my needs to help make the transition into a new life abroad just that little bit easier. Living abroad come with many challenges, so why not try to remove some of them and help things to go more smoothly? In my most recent international move I used all of what I talked about in this episode and more to help make my life that little bit easier.... not to say there weren't a few bumps in the road or that everything was perfect. However, living abroad will be a life-changing experience that you want to make sure you can enjoy as much as possible. In this expat podcast episode of Not Your Average Globetrotter, I'll be sharing part of my checklist for moving abroad to live in another country as well as share with you all where I have moved.<br /><br />1:31 - Part 1: Making sure you understand everything and that you are understood as well<br />3:19 - Part 2: Can you actually stay?<br />5:36 - Part 3: What you take and how you take it<br />12:43 - Part 4: Connection<br />19:06 - Part 5: Transportation<br /><br />The app I mentioned in this episode where you can buy an ESIM online is called Airalo and the referral code to save $3 is RAFAEL837 and here's the referral link I mentioned <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ref.airalo.com/dhht">https://ref.airalo.com/dhht</a><br /><br />NYAG Gear - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://store.rafaeldifuria.com">http://store.rafaeldifuria.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://RafaelDiFuria.com/nyaggear">http://RafaelDiFuria.com/nyaggear</a><br /><br />If you find my videos helpful, entertaining and/or if you feel as if I've helped you save time, headaches, or legal fees, please consider making a monthly pledge on Patreon and becoming a monthly patron to help make more videos like this possible:   <br />👉🏽 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://RafaelDiFuria.com/patreon">http://RafaelDiFuria.com/patreon</a><br /><br />Or,  if you would like to help in a different way and make a one-time donation you can visit:<br />👉🏽 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://RafaelDiFuria.com/support">http://RafaelDiFuria.com/support</a><br /><br />If you would be interested in  dedicating a video to a loved one and/or sponsoring a video, feel free to send a message through the following link:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/contact/">http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/contact/</a><br /><br />📬Let's connect <br />🔵Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/facebook">http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/facebook</a><br />🔵Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/instagram">http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/instagram</a><br />🔵Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/twitter">http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/twitter</a><br />🔵Email: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/contact/">http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/contact/</a><br /><br />💰 Save on your first stay with AirBNB<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/airbnbsave">http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/airbnbsave</a> (referral link)<br /><br />📦Recommended Products:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/rafaeldifuria">https://www.amazon.com/shop/rafaeldifuria</a><br /><br />💸Transfer money around the world with Transferwise (referral link) :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.rafaeldifuria.com/transferwise">http://www.rafaeldifuria.com/transferwise</a><br /><br />📩 Business Inquiries and Collaborations:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/contact/">http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/contact/</a><br /><br />🎙Want me to be the voice of your business?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/5VO">http://www.RafaelDiFuria.com/5VO</a><br /><br />#movingabroad #expatlife #expat{% endraw %}
