As such, there are many designs that are hard to find. If it’s hard to find, it’s likely you’ll find a collector willing to pay top dollar for a pretty penny.<br /><br />For example, one of the rare pennies from the early 20th century is the 1914 – S Lincoln Penny. While we still see Honest Abe on the penny today, this penny looks slightly different. On the face, it’s exactly the same as a modern-day penny, except for the year. On the back of the penny we see ‘ONE CENT’ and the name of the country in large text. This isn’t the rarest penny, but its pristine condition makes it a favorite among collectors.<br /><br />We’ve also got the 1943 Bronze Lincoln. As of this video’s initial publication, we’ve only come across a few of these pennies. As such, they are among the rare pennies that are sought-after by dedicated collectors. These are actually “error coins” but that doesn’t take away from their high value.<br /><br />The following year, the US Mint let out a penny that wasn’t made of bronze or copper! We’re talking about the 1944 Steel Wheat Penny. If you have one of these pennies lying around, you might just be able to sell it for around $100K!<br /><br />Even if you’ve never thought about coin collecting before, you might want to check your piggy bank to see if you’ve got any rare pennies lying around. You never know, your rare pennies might have built a gold mine!<br /><br />Watch this video to learn more about the rare pennies that are actually worth a LOT of money…<br /><br />Rare Pennies That Are Actually Worth a Lot of Money{% endraw %}
