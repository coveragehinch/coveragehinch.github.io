{% raw %}FunDuhMentals: How to set up your snowboard bindings with Danny Kass<br /><br />Your stance on a snowboard should be about shoulder width, with approximately 15 degrees of angle on your front binding and around 0 degrees in the back. Experiment and find what's most comfortable for you, in the end it's individual preference.<br /><br />Bindings and boards have standardized mounting systems, and almost all are are compatible. If unsure, consult a local shop.<br /><br />Determine your stance width. It should be comfortable and generally a bit wider than your shoulders. Use the distance from your kneecap to your heel for a standard stance width.<br />Mount your front binding with 15 degrees of positive angle. This is a basic starting point, and it helps open your hips for initiating turns.<br />Mount your back binding at 0 degrees.<br />Follow the reference stance on your board.<br />If you want to ride park, center the stance on the board and add negative angle on the back binding. This creates a slight “duck” stance for riding switch.<br />Set your stance back to create a longer nose and more float for powder days.<br />As you progress, experiment with your stance and find what’s confortable—more angle, less angle, wider, narrower, etc. Each adjustment fits your riding style to the board and to the conditions.<br /><br />Check out more at www.TWSNOW.com{% endraw %}
