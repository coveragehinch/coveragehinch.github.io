{% raw %}We're in a growth vortex, and Pflugerville is one of those places that has people excited and while prices are rising we still have options under $400,000. Sonja Muller from Pacesetter Homes is joining for today's discussion and to share a few things about both Pacesetter and Sorento in the Pflugerville area.<br /><br />‚ñ† SEE Houses on MLS üèòÔ∏è (Free Service): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ianofaustin.com">https://ianofaustin.com</a><br />‚ñ† CONTACT Me ‚è≠Ô∏è &amp; SOCIAL Media: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ianofaust.in/connect">https://ianofaust.in/connect</a><br />‚ñ† BUILD your CREDIT üí∏: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ianofaust.in/self">https://ianofaust.in/self</a><br />‚ñ† SUPPORT This  ‚ñ∂ Channel as a Member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ianofaust.in/members">https://ianofaust.in/members</a><br />‚ñ† JOIN Me ü§≤üèæ at REAL Brokerage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ianofaust.in/joinreal">https://ianofaust.in/joinreal</a><br /><br />#movingtoaustintexas #austinrealestate #ianofaustin #austinrealtor #relabatx<br /><br />Whether you arrived here from watching videos with #realmigos or #realestatelab or a simple google search for the best real estate agent in Austin and the surrounding area, and if I showed up I am glad you made it here to watch, learn, and share your thoughts.<br /><br />We have so many companies in Austin Texas like Zillow, Redfin, Opendoor that are trying to take the REAL relationships out of Real Estate. Fortunately, you have so many agents like myself and Kristina Smallhorn, Brad McCallum, Jeremy Knight, Ken Pozek, Javier Vidania, Katie Day, Malcolm Lawson, Sir Ashley, Jason Walters, Karin Carr, Reventure Consulting (j/k), and many more who are working hard to keep our clients educated and informed.<br /><br />When people are moving to Austin from other states such as from California to Texas, they may stumble upon agents from Keller Williams, Compass, Kuper Sotheby‚Äôs, and Chip and Joanna Gaines Magnolia Realty or even ReMax, but after leaving eXp Realty as an Icon Agent and joining REAL Brokerage in 2020 and becoming an Elite Agent, the technology we offer our clients and agents allows me to do a better job helping people like you.<br /><br />I @ianofaustin have personally helped hundreds of people get into a home in one of the fastest-growing cities that Elon Musk referred to as a boomtown. Speaking of, Tesla, Samsung, Apple, Google, Oracle, Dell, and maybe Disney one day, are all located near Austin in Round Rock, Cedar Park, Leander, Brushy Creek, Liberty Hill, Georgetown, Manor, Bastrop, Pflugerville, and there‚Äôs, even more, coming to Dripping Springs, Lakeway, Bee Cave, you get it. And with our incredible Master Planned communities like Santa Rita Ranch, Travisso, Bryson, Orchard Ridge, Berry Creek, Easton Park, Parker Station, Whisper Valley, and too many more to name that each has thousands of houses for millennials relocating to Texas who are ready to buy their first home, it feels like we are just getting started.<br /><br />Note: Texas law requires all license holders to provide the Information About Brokerage Services form to prospective clients. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ianofaust.in/iabs">https://ianofaust.in/iabs</a>{% endraw %}
