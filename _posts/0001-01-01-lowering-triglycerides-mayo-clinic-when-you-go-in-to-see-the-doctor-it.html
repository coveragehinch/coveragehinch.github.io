{% raw %}When you go in to see the doctor, it's typical to get a blood test to check lipid levels, your cholesterol and triglycerides. You likely know it's important to lower bad cholesterol levels, because high levels increase your risk of heart attack. The same holds true for triglycerides. But what you might not know is that instead of taking medicine to lower triglycerides, most people can lower that number simply by moving more.{% endraw %}
