{% raw %}Hi friends! In today's video I'm talk about real compatibility--not simply looking at two sun signs (or moon signs, horoscopes, zodiac signs) etc. We are looking at the different layers that need to be accounted for when we are evaluating whether two people will be compatible with each other. We talk about the different kinds of compatibility--intellectual, emotional, physical, etc.--and we talk about how we can define these things in the natal chart. <br /><br />I also go through the steps I take when evaluating two charts for compatibility and at the end I talk about how to use MY compatibility videos when making your own assessments. Oh I also talk about Co-Star and The Pattern. Mostly the Pattern and why I hate it and think it sucks.<br /><br />The Videos I mentioned in this video are:<br /><br />Finding your dominant planet--<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ENcfZmHXQF0">https://youtu.be/ENcfZmHXQF0</a><br /><br />Finding your &quot;Vibe&quot;--<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DheFLgm_cqg">https://youtu.be/DheFLgm_cqg</a><br /><br />#astrology #horoscopes #compatibility<br /><br />aries compatibility, taurus compatibility, cancer compatibility, scorpio compatibility, pisces compatibility, puro astrology, scorpio and cancer compatibility, how to find compatible signs, compatible horoscopes, compatible pisces,{% endraw %}
