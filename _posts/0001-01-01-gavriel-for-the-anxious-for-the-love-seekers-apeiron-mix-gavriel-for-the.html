It’s just an expression of happiness and contentment.<br />My producer Yoe and I wanted to keep it as a fully acoustic song riddled with cool and unique harmonies to give it a real easy and happy feel.<br /><br />love won't<br />Love makes many things better and more bearable, it challenges &amp; lets us grow beyond ourselves. But love, as much as we’d like it to be, is not a magic cure. It's about someone who wanted to be in a relationship so that their traumas and emotional unhealthiness would be healed. I couldn’t help but think about how happiness can only come from within. Love is a beautiful thing, but it still won’t make the bad go away.<br /><br />Too Good To Fake<br />Too Good to Fake was written for a friend of mine who was about to embark on a long distance relationship. Knowing how in love they were, my feeling was that she wouldn’t be able to bear being apart from him because their love was too good to be fake.<br />As soon as she left, the song came to me very quickly and naturally. The next day I recorded the whole thing in a few short minutes and it was easily the quickest turnaround on a song I’ve ever written recorded and released.<br /><br />It's You<br />It’s You is an ode to the people you care most about and who are always there for you when you need them most.<br />Close your eyes and think of the first person that comes to mind when you hear the words “It’s You, that gets me off the ground.”<br /><br />i'm out<br />i’m out is based on a feeling of when things get too much sometimes and you just need to be out.<br />The song started with the guitar riff in the begging and everything else was really constructed around that.<br /><br />haunted<br />This song is about wanting to be there for all of a loved one’s life, but understanding that love takes patience and the right one will come when they come.<br />I really wanted the ending of the song to be cinematic and have that “crying in the rain” feeling. Yoe and I had to work hard on this one to make that happen.<br /><br /><br /><br />You can find these songs and many more in my new playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6rw24d9bpBGZuMiUFRI2fH?si=a8518ac021a44f78">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6rw24d9bpBGZuMiUFRI2fH?si=a8518ac021a44f78</a><br /><br />» Follow Gavriel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/therealgavriel/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/therealgavriel/?hl=en</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/therealgavriel/">https://www.facebook.com/therealgavriel/</a><br /><br />∞ Follow APEIRON:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/ApeironSound">https://instagram.com/ApeironSound</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/ApeironSound">https://facebook.com/ApeironSound</a><br /><br /><br />» Follow Two Keys:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/twokeysrecords/">https://www.instagram.com/twokeysrecords/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/twokeysrecords">https://www.facebook.com/twokeysrecords</a><br /><br />» Picture: Dave Herring<br /><br />You could also listen to one of our many playlists: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/apeironsound/playlists">https://www.youtube.com/apeironsound/playlists</a><br /><br />#Gavriel #pop #APEIRON #chill #indie <br />#2021 #mix #playlist{% endraw %}
