{% raw %}This video shows how California scientists breed citrus and germinate the citrus seeds resulting from the crosses.<br /><br />Scientists have discovered that some Australian native citrus relatives show natural resistance to the deadly huanglongbing (HLB) disease. Crossing these Australian citrus relatives with traditional citrus varieties has the potential to produce hybrid offspring with resistance to HLB.<br /><br />This research is taking place at the University of California Riverside Citrus Variety Collection which is now threatened by HLB.<br /><br />To make a donation to the Citrus Variety Collection HLB Prevention fund, please click “Citrus Variety Collection HLB Prevention Initiative Fund” at the following link: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://myadv.ucr.edu/fruitmentor/200844">https://myadv.ucr.edu/fruitmentor/200844</a><br /><br />Things that you can do to slow the spread of HLB (playlist):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF_zkJckCHo&amp;list=PLhQ24kASgttNRBJTvlu7vDd5eeY5_2ksC">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF_zkJckCHo&amp;list=PLhQ24kASgttNRBJTvlu7vDd5eeY5_2ksC</a><br /><br />Citrus breeders carefully perform controlled pollination by choosing both the male and the female parent varieties. Seeds are extracted from the resulting fruit and then treated to remove pathogens. They hybrid citrus seeds are germinated. The seedlings are cloned by grafting. Some are used for diagnostic testing and others are planted  in the field.<br /><br />The accompanying article can be found here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fruitmentor.com/breeding-growing-citrus-from-seed">http://fruitmentor.com/breeding-growing-citrus-from-seed</a><br /><br />In California, the collection of any citrus propagative materials, including budwood and seeds, from non-registered sources is illegal. Any citrus trees grown or grafted in California must come from source trees registered with either:<br />(1) The Citrus Nursery Stock Pest Cleanliness Program, administered by the California Department of Food and Agriculture, or<br />(2) The Citrus Clonal Protection Program, located at the University of California at Riverside.<br />CDFA program: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/plant/pe/nsc/nursery/citrus.html">https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/plant/pe/nsc/nursery/citrus.html</a><br />CCPP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ccpp.ucr.edu/">http://ccpp.ucr.edu/</a>{% endraw %}
