{% raw %}Hello my dearest friends, and an especially warm welcome to anyone who's new! I'm Jason, and thanks so much for swooping by Owl's Eye Tarot! <br /><br />As always, take what applies - if it doesn't fit, kick it to the side. I'm reading for the collective, it's not a personal. <br /><br />(I encourage you to check your moon and rising placements as well, for a more well-rounded picture.)<br /><br />Please feel free to contact me, anytime, for any and all information about my personal readings here ➡<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Zennorjd82@gmail.com">https://Zennorjd82@gmail.com</a> <br /><br />PayPal- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/OwlsEyeTarot">https://www.paypal.me/OwlsEyeTarot</a><br /><br />Cash app- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cash.app/$OwlsEyeTarot">https://cash.app/$OwlsEyeTarot</a><br /><br />Tips / Donations to this channel are greatly appreciated, but NEVER necessary. THANK YOU for showing me support, in ANY and EVERY way. Time is so valuable, and I'm forever grateful that you've chosen to spend some with me. It's truly an increadable honor that I've never taken for granted. You are ALL appreciated here. 💛🙏<br /><br />Join Me over on Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Instagram.com/OwlsEyeTarot82">https://www.Instagram.com/OwlsEyeTarot82</a><br /><br />Join Me on TikTok -<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRFuHVVP/">https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRFuHVVP/</a><br />________________________________________<br /><br /> ➿ To my Owlets: Please remember to keep it kind in the comments. If it's something personal about someone, or if it's not kind or constructive, just don't say it. This is a SAFE SPACE, where we can ALL come together... and we can grow through our individual journies, learn from one another, lean on each other, and heal ourselves, together. I promise to  always keep it that way, and I really appreciate you all helping me maintain the structure and integrity around here. We have some HIGHLY observant Owls that reside here. A huge &quot;thank you!&quot; to them, and to all of you.<br /><br />   Bullying or disrespect of ANY kind, toward ANYONE, will be immediately erased, blocked and reported to YouTube. Thank you, in advance, for your kindness, always. 🙏     <br /><br />***  Remember, we're all unique individuals; no two journies are alike; if something resonates, great! But always make your own decisions regarding how YOU want to move forward. (Discernment is key.)<br /><br />  All the choices you make here are your own. You're the only one who knows how to truly navigate your life, because you're the only one who knows your story.<br /><br />  The answers you seek are within YOU; The Tarot simply brings them to the surface/center, and helps you gain new insight &amp; clarity into the situation(s) you're inquiring about. It can help shine a light into those dark corners of the psyche that we tend to avoid. 💛<br /><br />&quot;And the end of all our exploring<br />Will be to arrive where we started<br />And know the place for the first time.&quot; -T. S. Eliot<br /><br />Ok, that's all for now. I love you! Yes, YOU! 🌞 Thank you for supporting my dreams. <br />Sincerely, <br />Jason (Owl) and (my lil' familiar) Miss Luna. 🐱<br /><br />#pisces #tarot #piscestarot{% endraw %}
