{% raw %}My name is PAUL BARBERA. I am a photographer. ‘Where They Create’ is a visual documentation of the creative environments of artist &amp; creatives that I meet during my travels for assignments. This is my 4th Studio Visit of the amazing Shantell Martin. Soon to be released is the full interview, in the form of a podcast. Shot with the Sony A7r3{% endraw %}
