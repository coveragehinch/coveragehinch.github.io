{% raw %}Hi Everyone,<br /><br />With the death of the brilliant Stephen Sondheim, we’re experiencing the end of an era of songwriting that will never come again.<br /><br />Here’s a gorgeous song that he wrote for the ending of an early musical he wrote called “Anyone Can Whistle”. The song is “With So Little To Be Sure Of”. It feels like a goodbye song to someone who was loved.<br /><br />I loved singing and playing it. He was really something.<br /><br />Hope you like it too.<br /><br />Barry<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to Barry Manilow's YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://on.barrymanilow.com/trk/BarryYTSubs">https://on.barrymanilow.com/trk/BarryYTSubs</a><br />Watch More Barry Manilow Live Performances on YT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/BarryLivePL">https://bit.ly/BarryLivePL</a><br /><br />Follow Barry Manilow:<br />Official Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://on.barrymanilow.com/trk/ManilowDotCom">https://on.barrymanilow.com/trk/ManilowDotCom</a><br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://on.barrymanilow.com/trk/BarryFB">https://on.barrymanilow.com/trk/BarryFB</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://on.barrymanilow.com/trk/BarryIG">https://on.barrymanilow.com/trk/BarryIG</a><br />Twitter:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://on.barrymanilow.com/trk/BarryTweets">https://on.barrymanilow.com/trk/BarryTweets</a><br />TikTok:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tradablebits.com/trk/BarryTok">https://tradablebits.com/trk/BarryTok</a><br /><br />LYRICS:<br />(Stephen Sondheim)<br /><br />With so little to be sure of,<br />If there's anything at all.<br />If there's anything at all.<br />I'm sure of here and now and us together.<br />All I'll ever be I owe you,<br />If there's anything to be.<br />Being sure enough of you<br />Makes me sure enough of me.<br />Thanks for everything we did,<br />Everything that's past,<br />Everything's that's over too fast.<br />None of it was wasted,<br />All of it will last:<br />Everything that's here and now and us together!<br />It was marvelous to know you<br />And it isn't really through.<br />Crazy business this, this life we live in-<br />Can't complain about the time we're given-<br />With so little to be sure of in this world,<br />We had a moment!<br />A marvelous moment!<br /><br />#BarryManilow #WithSoLittleToBe Sure Of #AnyoneCanWhistle #SongForSondheim #SondheimTribute{% endraw %}
