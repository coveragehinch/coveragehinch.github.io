{% raw %}Have you ever camped on a sneaker brand drop overnight on a camping chair just to have your desired shoes next morning? Or did you understand only substantive words, the parts of day and camping chair in this previous sentence? Whatever it is, Tamás Trunk or DABLTY will show you the real face of GenerationZ. He wrote a book of his generation and brands at his age of 14. He has a YouTube channel about sneakers with thousands of followers, where he talks about exploring stories behind brands. He is a top athlete, he studies in Austria as an Alpine ski racer, and spends his summer vacations at the campus of University of Oxford. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
