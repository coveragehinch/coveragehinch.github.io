{% raw %}This is the 3rd of 4 videos, in a series of &quot;How to make Wine&quot;.  In this video I focus on clarifying the wine after the Secondary Stage(part 2) has completed.  If this is the first video you've watched in this series, consider watching it from the very beginning of these tutorials to make sure you understand all the basics.  The playlist link is down below.  <br /><br />After you watch this video, be sure to watch part 4, &quot;Bottling and Storing Wine&quot;.  The link for that video is also down below.  There's also a few products in that tutorial that you might be interested in with a 20% Discount code associated with it.<br /><br />You can follow these video tutorials with more information on my website, along with the exact ingredients to make this wine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://poormansgourmetkitchen.com/how-to-make-wine-part-1-the-primary-stage.html">https://poormansgourmetkitchen.com/how-to-make-wine-part-1-the-primary-stage.html</a><br /><br />How to make Wine part 1- Primary Stage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjRn619YVh0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjRn619YVh0</a><br /><br />How to make Wine part 2- Secondary Stage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAyRW4BYg-E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAyRW4BYg-E</a><br /><br />How to make Wine part 4- Bottling and Storing: <br /><br />How to make Wine Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgpSuUqzreMOrgYvCpuiM4D_5nSY9oPfJ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgpSuUqzreMOrgYvCpuiM4D_5nSY9oPfJ</a><br /><br />To get this complete recipe with all of the exact measurements and ingredients, check out my website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://poormansgourmetkitchen.com/">http://poormansgourmetkitchen.com/</a><br /><br />1 New Video per week, usually Wed or Fri Afternoon<br />Subscribe Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=PoorMansGourmet">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=PoorMansGourmet</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PMGKcooking">https://twitter.com/PMGKcooking</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PoorMansGourmetKitchen">https://www.facebook.com/PoorMansGourmetKitchen</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pinterest.com/PoorMansGourmet/">http://www.pinterest.com/PoorMansGourmet/</a><br /><br />Most Popular Video: Mongolian Beef  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQT_Yyj3Skk&amp;index=125&amp;list=PLgpSuUqzreMNQbhfJDJvVqq-knsDGEknL">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQT_Yyj3Skk&amp;index=125&amp;list=PLgpSuUqzreMNQbhfJDJvVqq-knsDGEknL</a><br /><br />Seems like I've got a recipe for just about any occasion, these days.
