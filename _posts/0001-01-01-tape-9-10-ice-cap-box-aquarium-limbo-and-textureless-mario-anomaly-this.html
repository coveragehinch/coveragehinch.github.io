{% raw %}This tape is labeled &quot;May 30, 1999&quot;. The guy who recorded this video found many anomalies resulting from the action of modifying the game of artificial intelligence. The AI was able to restore a lost cap box. For now we know that &quot;Ice Cap&quot; is able to pass the flames without taking damage and walk on water, will he have any other secret abilities? We also have the presence of &quot;Aquarium Limbo&quot; and consequently &quot;Textureless Mario Anomaly&quot; within the lost level.<br /><br />Subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss Tape 10/10. A second season of Super Mario 64 Haunted Records is also confirmed. Stay tuned XD.{% endraw %}
