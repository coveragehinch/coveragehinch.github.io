{% raw %}In this animated programme, our character Sam shows students the basics of the hard working operating system. Engaging graphics are used to explain concepts clearly and visually, depicting how an operating system interacts with various other software and hardware, and why the kernel is important. Students will also learn about primary and secondary memory, device management, and how the operating system provides an interface for the user.<br /><br />About ClickView:<br />We cover every level of learning - primary, secondary and tertiary, and are ready to help you and your students achieve greater outcomes.
