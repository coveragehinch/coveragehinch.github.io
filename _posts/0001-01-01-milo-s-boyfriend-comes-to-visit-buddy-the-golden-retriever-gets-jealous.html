{% raw %}Yes that's right, it's 2021 and Milo has loved Claude since he first laid paws on him. The two clearly have a major bromance and are forever rolling about together. Of recent though Milo has shown the cold shoulder to Claude as he's taken a dislike to his favourite Amelia! I think they'll make up though once they've had a chat. Buddy tries to get involved but is instantly told where to go, Milo doesn't want a third wheel haha.{% endraw %}
