{% raw %}The debate for the greatest horror game of all time is a complicated one, with some deserving candidates up for the spot. You have the likes of all-time classics such as Silent Hill, but Until Dawn certainly has a space among the best. This first-person horror game was originally designed for PS 3, but the developers soon changed it to a third-person perspective and shifted it to PS 4. The gameplay is legitimately scary, mainly because the narrative offers a familiar situation that you have all seen in horror slasher flicks. Remember all the times you scowled and screamed at the wrong decisions made by the protagonists? Well, now it is time to see how you hold up in a similar pressure situation. There are some twists that you wonâ€™t see coming, and there are some defining do-or-die sequences in the game, but we were scared the most by the Wendigo monster.<br />The game was blessed by a prolific writing team, and the perfect voice-cast meant that the narrative meant business. However, the creators did not come up with the concept of Wendigo. This monster has been a part of mythologies, and the terrifying antics of the Wendigo have been around for decades. In this video, we will dive deep into the dark waters, and bring you all there is to know about the Wendigo monster from the game and the folklore. Turn off the lights and enter the dark chilling world of the hideous man-eating monster!{% endraw %}
