{% raw %}Lenovo YOGA C940 review in terms of application and use, in other words the user-experience.<br />The computer is for production purposes, and thus replacing a 4 years old Asus laptop, that became obsolete in speed and efficiency.<br />The YOGA is really fast, can handle multiple applications running at the same time, which is clearly noticeable after the Asus laptop. It is a breeze to manage a task and can save me valuable time. If counting nothing else, then already this one advantage made it to be a worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />For everyday work, I am using the Surface Pro4, which is also a 4.5 years old 2-in-1 laptop, but it is still an unbelievably great computer. By replacing it later this year, I will stick either to the newest Surface Pro (now Surface Pro7), or to the Surface Book (now Surface Book 2).<br /><br />How a PowerPoint presentation can be produced into video, check this: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/78pSRzmNqBY">https://youtu.be/78pSRzmNqBY</a><br /><br />Coming back to the YOGA, here is the tech specification:<br />- 14-inch 2-in-1 laptop and tablet<br />- 10th generation Intel Core i7 with Turbo Boost, 8MB Cache<br />- 4K display, 3840 x 2160, 400 nits brightness<br />- touchscreen, glossy<br />- 16 GB LPDDR4X 3733 MHz (soldered)<br />- 512 GB SSD<br />- Intel 802.11 AX (2x2)<br />- Bluetooth 5.0<br />- Camera 720p HD <br />- Fingerprint Reader<br />- Active Pen with garage<br />- Backlit keyboard<br />- Windows 10 Home (that I want to upgrade to Win10 Pro)<br />- Intel Iris Plus graphics<br />- Rotating Sound Bar, Dolby Atmos speaker system<br />- 2x far-field microphones<br />- weight: 2.98 lbs. (1.35 kg)<br />- Ports: 2x USB 3.1 gen 2 Type-C/Intel Thunderbolt 3 (for power, display)<br />-  1x USB 3.1 gen 2 Type-A<br />- Headphone/mic combo<br />- TrueBlock Privacy shutter<br /><br />And the applications I use for production:<br />- CyberLink, POWER DIRECTOR SUITE 365 (annual subscription, renewal is approx. $103, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/director-suite/overview_en_US.html">https://www.cyberlink.com/products/director-suite/overview_en_US.html</a> <br />which comes with a bundle of software with year around updates to the latest, such as the (1) Power Director for the ultimate video editing, (2) Photo Director for photo editing that can be used in your videos, (3) Color Director, for color editing and the much needed (4) Audio Director where you can edit and adjust the audio files you use in the video production.<br />And on top of these, you get some extra, example the (1) Power DVD Ultra software to see DVDs in your computer or to project it, (2) Power2Go for mobile video editing, and (3) Screen Recorder.<br /><br />- CyberLink,YOUCAM 9, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/youcam/features_en_US.html">https://www.cyberlink.com/products/youcam/features_en_US.html</a> which was not included in the Suite 365 bundle, is approx. $35, one time purchase. This is a software to use for the built-in camera in the YOGA, a webcam software, that allows you to record (1) Presentations with any type of file integration, usually Power Point, (2) Desktop Capture application, when YouCam records everything you see and do on the screen, basically it is a screen recorder in this function (3) Camera Capture recording, how you present, talk, describe anything in front of the Lenovo camera for your online presentation, and (4) Dual Camera recording possibility, when you wish to use 2 cameras, the built-in Lenovo camera, and a USB attached other/outside camera, and YouCam can integrate it. (5) and it has also a Surveillance and Face Log-In and Log-Out feature. As you noticed it has a tones of feature, I do not wish to detail them, herein.<br /><br />Questions, people raise: &quot;Why do you need the YouCam software, when you have the Power Director? Cannot the Power Director capture presentations with the camera integration?&quot; These are excellent questions. Here is the reason:  (1) when you are broadcasting your presentation online and live it is easier to use the YouCam, which is tailored specifically for presentation. (2) the Power Director is &quot;big body&quot; of software, may drag your power resources and you can get easily distracted during a presentation. (3) but you can Capture anything from multiple devices in the Power Director. (4) if you are not live broadcasting, all your You Cam presentations can still be (further) edited as you wish in the Power Director.<br /><br />I have NO association with CyberLink.<br /><br />Other applications I use, are:<br />- MS Office 365, all applications, comes with OneDrive and 1 TB capacity<br />- Kindle<br />- Bookshelf for textbooks, from VitalSource Technologies, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/">https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/</a> <br />- Document Capture Pro with OCR functions for the Epson Scanner DS-575W, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/31fVNh2">https://amzn.to/31fVNh2</a> , $400<br />- PDF Escape, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pdfescape.com">https://www.pdfescape.com</a> for PDF files, annual subscription for the Premium membership is only $36, and comes with great and necessary features.<br />- DOOSL wireless presenterDSITO23 for Power Point with green laser, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3b9VFEq">https://amzn.to/3b9VFEq</a> <br /><br />Music in this video is from the YouTube Audio Library.<br />Produced on January 28, 2020 by ILDIKO NYARI, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ildikonyari.com">https://ildikonyari.com</a> <br /><br />#Lenovo, #YOGA, #editing, #CyberLink, #video, #production, #C940, #laptop, #tablet, #2in1, #twoinone, #thinkpad, #surface, #SurfacePro, #Epson, #scanner, #Bookshelf, #VitalSource, #textbooks, #pdf{% endraw %}
