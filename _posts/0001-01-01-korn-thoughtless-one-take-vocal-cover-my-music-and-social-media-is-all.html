{% raw %}MY MUSIC AND SOCIAL MEDIA IS ALL LINKED HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/HungryLights">https://linktr.ee/HungryLights</a><br /><br />Hoot me another real-time vocal cover of  &quot;Thoughtless.&quot; I made this video to show off my voice a little bit and get people to check out all my projects. Sorry I did not use an instrumental. <br /><br />For anyone wondering, my screaming technique is false cord screaming, not fry. I can do both, but I prefer false cord 99% of the time. Outside of Tallah and my other solo stuff, I am a vocal coach, so if anyone wants lessons, hit me up at &quot;Red_Nocturne02@yahoo.com.&quot;<br /><br />ðŸŒ€ Thank you so much for all of your support! ðŸŒ€{% endraw %}
