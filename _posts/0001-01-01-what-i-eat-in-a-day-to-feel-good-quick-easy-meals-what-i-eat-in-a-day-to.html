What made you go vegan? After watching Forks Over Knives and What The Health on Netflix I started to make some changes back in 2016. Also when my husband, Hector was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2017 - this really pushed us to become fully plant based<br />--  (We still of course have room for improvement we are NOT perfect with how we eat by any means.) <br /><br />2. Do you count calories? No. I find that it doesn't work for me personally. I'm aware of what I eat / how much but overall I like to eat foods I enjoy without the restrictions *this is what works for me, everyone is different* <br /><br />3. How much weight have you lost? I started out at 175lbs. in 2018 (my heaviest) but now I am now 130lbs &amp; 5'3.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />ðŸ’• Let's Be Friends &amp; Stay In Touch<br />MY VLOG CHANNEL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Rg9jg2">https://bit.ly/2Rg9jg2</a> <br />TIKTOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@juicyjasofficial">https://www.tiktok.com/@juicyjasofficial</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/juicyjasofficial/">https://www.instagram.com/juicyjasofficial/</a><br />TWTTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/juicyyyyjas/">https://www.twitter.com/juicyyyyjas/</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/juicyjasofficial/">https://www.facebook.com/juicyjasofficial/</a><br /><br />âž¤ For business inquiries only: juicyyyyjas@yahoo.com<br /><br />My PO BOX --<br />Jasmine <br />PO BOX 92 <br />Birdsboro, PA 19508 <br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />ðŸ’• COUPON CODES - If you use my codes I do make a % of commission<br /><br />ðŸ’– My Amazon Storefront <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/juicyjas">https://www.amazon.com/shop/juicyjas</a><br /><br />ðŸ’– Rakuten (formally known as Ebates) Get Cash Back when you shop online.
