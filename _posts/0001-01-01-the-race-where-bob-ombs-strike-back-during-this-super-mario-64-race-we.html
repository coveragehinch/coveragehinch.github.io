{% raw %}During this Super Mario 64 race, we experience a complete Super Mario Meltdown. Can our contestants LVRKD and CORF24 recover? Or will the Bob-omb destroy their speedrun? <br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by eriksenchee<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eriksenchee">https://twitter.com/eriksenchee</a><br /><br />Simply continues his Super Mario 64 tournament, Sophomore 16. This tournament features Mizkif, Ludwig, Boxbox, Papaplatte, Emiru, Jawsh, and more. Simply and Emiru &amp; Simply and Mizkif all live in a house in Austin, TX. Too bad both aren't in my Mario 64 Tournament anymore. Although, which Super Mario 64 speedrunner will get the top spot? Will I steal their chips like the simply chip theif emiru I am? Or will they do Chip Clip. Or maybe they'll attempt some framewalk. Or maybe, just maybe, they'll get the Super Mario 64 16 star world record. Mizkif mario 64 speedruns won't be it though.<br /><br />#mario #speedrun #speedrunning{% endraw %}
