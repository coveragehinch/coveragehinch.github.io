{% raw %}Hi, Guyz! Let me show you around another beach which we discovered only while on our road trip few weeks ago.<br /><br />Most of the Dubai residents go to Jumeirah open beach (including Kite Beach, Lamer &amp; JBR area) for its pristine crystal clear water and fine sands. Considering also the accessibility of these beaches to public transportations, you will see a lot of beach goers whether residents or tourist all around.<br /><br />However, if you want to spend a relaxing day hearing only the sounds of the waves and wind, you may want to visit Jebel Ali Beach. This is totally a hidden gem, I must say. Take note, it's a bit inconvenient for those who will take public transportations but if you can drive, then hop in! It's a perfect place to unwind.<br /><br />The beach is open from 6:00am to 6:00pm daily and open to campers with caravans at night. Only those with caravans who secured permit are allowed to stay overnight to camp. No tents allowed! <br /><br />A food truck is open at night for campers who would like to unwind under the stars with comfy bean bags and pallet seats. It could be a fun night, I guess!<br /><br />So come and visit this place! Let's swim and enjoy with the fish that freely swims along the shore... <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />#jebelali<br />#jebelalibeach<br />#dubaibeach <br />#dubai <br />#hiddengem<br />#timeoutdubai <br />#whereindubai <br />#lovindubai<br />#thenational <br />#whatsonduba<br />#expatlife <br />#dubaiexpats<br />#uaeexpats{% endraw %}
