Lyrics are below:<br /><br />LIGHT UP<br /><br />We are the reverie<br />We are the dreamers<br />We dance through the night, in our bones we can feel it<br />Aiming for the stars against the sky<br />When we are together, we are bright<br /><br />We’ll light up<br />We’ve been waiting for this moment to come<br />We were made for this adventure<br />We feel it in our blood<br />We’ll light up!<br /><br />Eyes open wide and the world is before us<br />We are the sound of a beautiful chorus<br />Holding to the feeling, you and I<br />When we are together, we are bright<br /><br />We’ll light up<br />We’ve been waiting for this moment to come<br />We were made for this adventure<br />We feel it in our blood<br />We’ll light up<br />We have everything we need and we know<br />We were made for this adventure<br />And we were made to go<br />We’ll light up!<br /><br />Aiming for the stars against the sky<br />When we are together, we are bright<br /><br />We’ll light up<br />We’ve been waiting for this moment to come<br />We were made for this adventure<br />We feel it in our blood<br />We’ll light up<br />We have everything we need and we know<br />We were made for this adventure<br />And we were made to go<br />We’ll light up!<br />We’ll light up!<br />We’ll light up!<br /><br /><br />Connect with me!<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.timhalperin.com">http://www.timhalperin.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/timhalperinofficial">http://www.facebook.com/timhalperinofficial</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/timhalperin">http://www.twitter.com/timhalperin</a><br />Tumblr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://timhalperin.tumblr.com">http://timhalperin.tumblr.com</a>{% endraw %}
