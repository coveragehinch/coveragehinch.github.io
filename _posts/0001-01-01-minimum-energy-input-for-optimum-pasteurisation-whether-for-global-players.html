{% raw %}Whether for global players in the beer industry or small craft brewers, the Krones VarioFlash B can be adapted to any individual application. Krones has found a solution for a resource-saving process for maintaining sterility even during a production interruption: The patented eco-hygenic sleep mode. Stefan Höller and Roland Feilner talk about the advantages of this energy-saver and also explain why beer quality benefits from the also patented express pasteurisation process.<br /><br />The Krones Group plans, develops and manufactures machines and complete lines for the fields of process, filling and packaging technology. Its product portfolio is rounded off by information technology, factory planning and products from Krones’ subsidiaries as intralogistics, valve production etc. <br /><br />You can find all current information about Krones AG here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.krones.com/">https://www.krones.com/</a> <br />And much more on our Krones magazine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.krones.com/en/company/press/krones-magazine.php.">https://www.krones.com/en/company/press/krones-magazine.php.</a><br /><br />#Brewery #ResourceConservation #Quality{% endraw %}
