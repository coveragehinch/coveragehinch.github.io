{% raw %}Have you ever wondered what has influenced your political values the most? Political scientists actually study and measure how our political behavior, attitudes, and ideologies are shaped over time. This is called political socialization and in this video we look at the four biggest agents of socialization: Family, School, Media, and Religion. Afterwards we look at patterns in socialization including different demographics. Lastly we look at demographics with a statistical lens and see how that has influenced party affiliation for the Democrat and Republican parties. <br /><br />Sources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_socialization">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_socialization</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-government-and-civics/us-gov-american-political-ideologies-and-beliefs/us-gov-political-socialization/a/lesson-summary-political-socialization?modal=1">https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-government-and-civics/us-gov-american-political-ideologies-and-beliefs/us-gov-political-socialization/a/lesson-summary-political-socialization?modal=1</a><br /><br />#PoliticalSocialization #politics #Socialization #Democrat #Republican{% endraw %}
