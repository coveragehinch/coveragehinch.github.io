From fatphobic marketing to racism in company group chats, it seems that there's actually a lot going on behind the scenes in order to produce a floral tank top. Don't think I forgot about the suspicious depop resellers either! Join me in dissecting the fast fashion empire that has teenagers in a chokehold. Or don't lmao u have agency so feel free to pick netflix instead<br /><br />_____________________________________________________<br /><br />→ my socials<br />ig • <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/miiasaurous/">https://www.instagram.com/miiasaurous/</a><br /><br />Business Inquiries ONLY: miiamarikaki@gmail.com<br />_____________________________________________________<br /><br />This video is sponsored by AtlasVPN.
