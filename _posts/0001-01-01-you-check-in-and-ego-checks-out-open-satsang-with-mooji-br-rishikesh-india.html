{% raw %}Open Satsang with Mooji<br />Rishikesh, India<br />27 February 2020<br /><br />During this satsang, a seeker brings forward a question about free will and about the tendency to want to control life too much and not being able to surrender. Moojibaba offers a guidance on observing with detachment, a precious introduction to satsang and Self-awareness. <br /><br />Moojibaba’s interactions with other questioners touch on vigilance, and discerning between the impersonal ‘I’ and the personal sense of self. <br /><br />“Self-awareness is what you are longing for. It is weakening the sense of the personal self. <br /><br />Resting in your own radiance, what is time for you? What is wealth for you? What is reputation? Don’t entertain the psychology of the mind. Look, see, and make use of — don’t over-nourish the play of personhood, it's always going somewhere else.” <br /><br />~<br /><br />The recordings and downloadables of these talks are available on Mooji.TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.tv/india2020">https://mooji.tv/india2020</a><br /><br />Live music after Satsang: &quot;Forever You&quot; by Omkara &amp; Gotama (not available on an album). Lyrics from 'The Mala of God' by Mooji.<br /><br />~<br /><br />More information about Mooji including schedule information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.org">https://mooji.org</a><br />More videos / podcasts including online retreats and the Sahaja Express subscription service: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.tv">https://mooji.tv</a>{% endraw %}
