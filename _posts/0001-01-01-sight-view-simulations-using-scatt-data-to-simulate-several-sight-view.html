{% raw %}Using scatt data to simulate several sight view options based on the quality of the shooter sight alignment. The first simulation is the view that is received for a specific shot when the shooter performed with 100% sight alignment (front/rear sights moves as single unit). The second simulation is the view received if the shooter is 100% steady with the rear sight and have very poor sight alignment, all movements are due to front sight movements. The last simulation is a combined movement (20% parallel  &amp; 80% angular){% endraw %}
