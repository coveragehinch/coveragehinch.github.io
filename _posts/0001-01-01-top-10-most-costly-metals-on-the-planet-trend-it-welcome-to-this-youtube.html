{% raw %}Welcome To This YouTube Channel!<br />In This Video, We Are Going To Talk About “Top 10 Most Costly Metals On The Planet | Trend It |“ . <br /><br />Each metal has a different value, and this value predominantly depends on the rarity of the metal, how difficult it is to extract, and the metal’s properties. Throughout history, precious metals have been used as valuable currency and they have now become a form of investments. <br /><br />01:27 Indium<br />02:52 Scandium<br />03:37 Silver<br />04:49 Rhenium<br />05:31 Osmium<br />06:03 Iridium<br />06:50 Ruthenium<br />07:36 Gold<br />08:25 Palladium<br />09:23 Rhodium<br /><br />10. Indium<br />Indium is a soft white-silvery chemical element that can be identified by its symbol, In, and its atomic number 49.<br />Apart from Alkali, Indium is the softest metal on the planet and is a post-transition metal that accounts for approximately 0.21 parts per million of the earth’s crust. <br /><br />9. Scandium<br />The next most expensive precious metal in the world is Scandium.<br />This chemical element can be identified using its symbol, Sc, or atomic number 21.A.<br />Scandium was first discovered in Scandinavia in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite. Credit was given to Swedish Scientist, Lars Nilsson, who appropriately named it after Scandinavia. <br /><br />8. Silver<br />Coming in at number 8 on our list of precious metals is one of the most well known and common metals on the planet, silver. <br />Its chemical element symbol is Ag, and its atomic number is 47. <br />Silver exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal known to man.<br /><br /> 7. Rhenium<br />Rhenium is considered to be one of the rarest metals in the earth’s crust and has the third-highest melting point and second-highest boiling point of any stable element. <br />It can be identified using its chemical element symbol, Re, and atomic number 75. <br /><br />6. Osmium<br />Osmium is a hard bluish-white transition metal in the platinum group that can be found as a trace element in alloys and Platinum ores. <br />It’s the densest naturally occurring element and is commonly used to make fountain-pen nib tipping and electrical contacts. <br /><br />5. Iridium<br />Iridium is a hard silvery-white transition metal that is considered to be the second densest metal on earth. <br />It is the most corrosion-resistant metal and can be found in abundance in meteorites and the earth’s crust. <br /><br /> 4. Ruthenium<br />Coming in at number four on our list of the most expensive precious metals is Ruthenium. <br />Ruthenium is a chemical element that can be identified by the symbol Ru and atomic number 44. <br />Belonging to the Platinum group; Ruthenium is a rare transition metal that was discovered by Russian-born scientist, Karl Ernst Claus, in 1844 at Kazan State University.<br /><br />3. Gold<br />The third most expensive precious metal in the world is gold. <br />This precious metal needs no introduction as it’s arguably the most commonly known metal in the world. <br />In its purest form, gold can is a bright yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal and is one of the least reactive chemical elements on earth. <br /><br />2. Palladium<br />The Second most expensive precious metal in the world is Palladium. <br />Palladium is a chemical element identified by the symbol Pd and its atomic number 46. <br />Discovered in 1803 by English Chemist William Hyde Wollaston, Palladium was named after the asteroid Pallas.<br /><br />1. Rhodium<br />The title of the most expensive precious metal in the world goes to Rhodium. <br />This precious metal is extremely rare and can be best described as a silver-white, hard, corrosion-resistant inert transition metal. <br /><br />Thanks for watching the video.
