{% raw %}&quot;Stuttgart 24 June 1920&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Decline of human civilization as a consequence of materialism. <br />Material world can only be truly understood in the spirit. <br />Materialistic view of the human heart as a pump. Head as the fruit of previous life on earth. <br />Materialistic view of history. Economic life as head organ of the social organism, <br />the sphere of rights as its rhythmical organ and cultural life as its metabolic organ. <br />Threefold social order, Waldorf School, Kommender Tag. The destructive quality of untruthfulness.<br /> Spiritual science and and practical life.&quot;<br /><br />(Titles of individual videos in general not titles given by Rudolf Steiner)<br /><br />----------<br />All rights reserved.
