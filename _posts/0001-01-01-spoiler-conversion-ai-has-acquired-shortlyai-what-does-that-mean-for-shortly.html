{% raw %}It's true! ShortlyAI has been acquired by Conversion AI (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aicontentdojo.com/conversion-ai-marketer-centric-gpt-3-writing-app/)">https://aicontentdojo.com/conversion-ai-marketer-centric-gpt-3-writing-app/)</a><br /><br />I know there's a lot of things being said about it and if you're a Shortly customer you may be wondering what all this means for you. In this video, I try to answer that and share my thoughts.<br /><br />One thing is for sure. The AI Content Dojo has so much more to do to help your content creation workflow. There are far more tools to cover than just Shortly, Conversion AI, and Frase. :)<br /><br />The AI Content Dojo is eternal and you're one of my ninjas.
