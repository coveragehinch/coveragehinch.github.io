{% raw %}HI PHAMðŸ’• how are you all feeling for the holiday season? We are âœ¨stressedâœ¨ but hanging in there! To relieve some stress we did the obvious thingâ€¦ bake Christmas cookies ðŸ¤ªðŸ˜‚ â€¦ it went as bad as youâ€™d expect LOL<br /><br />With all the stresses of the holidays AND buying gifts AND travelling, there has been ONE thing thatâ€™s kept us sane: Paigeâ€™s FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor! This sensor is a flash glucose monitoring system which basically means she can check her glucose levels ANY time (and Iâ€™ll even get a notification, too!)<br /><br />It is really important for both Paige and I to manage her levels as best we can, and her FreeStyle Libre 2 makes it so much easier. The system even sends a push notification to both of our phones*** when Paigeâ€™s glucose levels breach her pre-set ranges so we can quickly correct and keep her on the ball to buy me the perfect Christmas present ðŸ˜‰  <br />Only jokingâ€¦ kinda ðŸ˜‡<br />To learn more about the FreeStyle Libre 2, you can visit myfreestyle.ca<br />#ad #TeamFreeStyleLibre @Abbott<br /><br /><br />PLEASE LIKE, COMMENT, AND SUBSCRIBE! ðŸ’•<br />â€¢ The FreeStyle Libre 2 flash glucose monitoring system is indicated for measuring interstitial fluid glucose levels in people aged 4 years and older with diabetes mellitus.
