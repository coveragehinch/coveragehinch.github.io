{% raw %}Simply's Sophomore 16 SM64 tournament continues. However, will contestants Coney and Yorn play fair during their Super Mario 64 Race? <br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by eriksenchee<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eriksenchee">https://twitter.com/eriksenchee</a><br /><br /><br />Simply commentates over the Sophomore 16 Super Mario 64 race. This was a live Twitch speedrun, not on YouTube. Who do you think I am, Ludwig? However, Ludwig SM64 content will be coming eventually as he is in the Mario 64 tournament. Super Mario 64 races are extremely fun, which is why Simply has hosted a few, such as Freshman 16 and Sophomore 16. During these two Twitch events, streamers race against each other for some prize money. Kind of like MrBeast's Squid Game. Seems like more people are playing Super Mario 64 on Twitch now, such as Disguised Toast, after Mizkif taught Emiru Mario 64 16 stars. Should Simply create a video on how to get started speedrunning Super Mario 64 like other Twitch streamers are? Let me know!<br /><br />#mario64 #speedrun #sm64{% endraw %}
