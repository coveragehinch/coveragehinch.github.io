{% raw %}The squirrel and pets eat durian: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n23rhEBdmGI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n23rhEBdmGI</a><br />The squirrel looked at the cat close by. The hairy worm crawled up the dry branch. The parrot watched the Australian flying squirrel in the cage. Train your dog to practice standing. The dog ran into the door. Two fox dogs stood looking at their owner. The squirrel and the cat looked at the garden together. The black and white dog cuddles the yellow cat. Sun Conure parrots suck on human fingers. The ground squirrel pulls cloth hanging from the bench. Watch the green parrot with the four-eyed dog.{% endraw %}
