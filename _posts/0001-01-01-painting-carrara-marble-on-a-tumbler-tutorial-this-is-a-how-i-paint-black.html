{% raw %}This is a how I paint black and white marble on my tumblers! It is a lengthy process, but it can be done! You can purchase my marble tumblers at: etsy.com/shop/fallenappledesigns. I was unable to add on the application of glittered epoxy<br />- maybe another video!<br />The glitter (High Flash White Silver) is only available at yayasglitter.com<br /><br />Epoxy is Alumilite Clear Cast<br /><br />All spray paints are Rustoleum{% endraw %}
