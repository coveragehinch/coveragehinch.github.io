{% raw %}Arduino Multifuction Shield<br /><br />IN this video we look at the Arduino multi-fuction shield that is widely available on eBay. It has 4 discreet LED's, a 4 digit 7 segment display, 3 tac switches, two interface headers and one open header.<br />While the library written for the shield is very nicely done, the shield itself is of the lowest quality. There is flux residue everwhere, it doesn't fit squarely into an Arduino,and the tac switches are each soldered at their own jaunty angle.<br />On the plus side...it's cheap and has yet to blow up.<br /><br />PDF on using the shield: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mpja.com/download/hackatronics-arduino-multi-function-shield.pdf">https://www.mpja.com/download/hackatronics-arduino-multi-function-shield.pdf</a><br /><br />Buy the shield here if you dare: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/jhvmML">https://goo.gl/jhvmML</a><br /><br />Shield Library: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/DireCat/MFShield">https://github.com/DireCat/MFShield</a><br /><br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-<br />Please watch: &quot;Diodes: The basic building block of all digital circuits&quot; <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyii5I30gw0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyii5I30gw0</a><br />-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-{% endraw %}
