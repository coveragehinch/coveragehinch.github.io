Although we will try to stay as close to the truth in presenting objective facts (i.e there are 27 EU commissioners not 10), it is much more difficult to stay close to the truth when it comes to important narratives. <br /><br />What the team decides is 'news' can shift the attention to a certain set of facts that may be true but may not be as important for other people, and this is where bias can easily come to fruition. <br /><br />We ask the viewers to be aware of our bias and realize that, just like them, we are an imperfect team pushed by our own moral convictions and beliefs.<br /><br />Music:<br /><br />Title: Blue Wednesday, tender spring - Exhale<br />Artist: Blue Wednesday<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chillhop.bandcamp.com/track/exhale">https://chillhop.bandcamp.com/track/exhale</a><br /><br />Dreamer by Hazy<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/hazy_music">https://soundcloud.com/hazy_music</a> <br />Music provided by <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.plugnplaymusic.net">https://www.plugnplaymusic.net</a><br /><br />Chapters:<br /><br />00:00 | Intro<br />00:56 | Belgian Federal State<br />01:30 | Communities vs Regions<br />02:18 | The Divides Are Real<br />03:21 | Belgian History<br />05:18 | European Divides<br />06:06 | Outro{% endraw %}
