There is a large outdoor pool and pool house, along with a putting green, set on nearly two acres of land. The property is listed by Sina Omidi of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties.<br />While Harry and Meghan's current home may be half the price of this neighbouring estate, it is equally luxurious judging by the rare glimpses we have been given inside over the past 18 months.<br />Video calls and TV appearances made by the couple have offered sneak peeks at a few areas of the residence, including their living room, which has a neutral colour scheme and decorative touches from coffee table books, vases of fresh flowers and Diptyque candles.<br /><br />#Harry #PrinceHarry #TheQueen #Queen #MeghanMarkle #Wedding #anniversary #Diana #PrinceWilliam #Kate #PrinceCharles #Archie #Phillip #Meghan #Archie #Lilibet #Diana{% endraw %}
