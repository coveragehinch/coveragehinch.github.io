{% raw %}All McDonald's wants this holiday season is for you... to join Mariah Carey for 12 days of deals. Because when an iconic holiday superstar is a fan of the Golden Arches, it’s only right to begin the season by gifting customers an entire menu full of free* goodies. From Mariah’s own favorite, a classic Cheeseburger, to soft-baked Chocolate Chip Cookies, we made a list of some of our fans’ favorite menu items and checked it twice. The Mariah Menu will make its debut in the U.S. on Dec. 13, featuring a different free item each day with a $1 minimum purchase on the McDonald’s app. <br /><br />Read more here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/.mariah-carey-holiday.html">https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/.mariah-carey-holiday.html</a><br /><br />*Available only at participating McDonald’s in the local area. Valid 1x/day with $1 min. purchase (excl. tax) from Dec. 13-24. See app for details.{% endraw %}
