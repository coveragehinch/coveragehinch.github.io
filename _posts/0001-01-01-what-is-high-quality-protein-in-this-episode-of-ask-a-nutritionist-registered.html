{% raw %}In this episode of Ask a Nutritionist, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist Kristal Shelden, answers the question, “How do I know if I'm eating high quality protein?”<br /><br />Protein is an essential nutrient required by our bodies for everyday use. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein, helping build, maintain and deliver oxygen to our muscles, metabolize other nutrients and support a healthy immune system. Our bodies produce some, but not all, of the amino acids needed to support tissue growth and repair, which is why consuming high quality protein with essential amino acids is so important.  <br /><br />Tune in to learn more about protein quality, how our bodies absorb and use it, and recommendations on what types of food provide the highest quality of protein from both animal and plant –based sources.  <br /><br />Subscribe to our channel to join the conversation and stay up-to-date on the latest episodes!
