{% raw %}When a young woman saw a dog roaming her neighborhood, she called it over. The pit bull seemed friendly, but when her little dog, Max, came outside, all hell broke loose. The woman picked up Max, but the pit bull wouldnâ€™t give up, and kept snapping at the small dog. All of a sudden, an Amazon delivery driver appeared, putting herself in harm's way and blocking the pit bull so the lady and her dog could get inside. Inside Edition reunited the heroic driver and the woman and pup she rescued.{% endraw %}
