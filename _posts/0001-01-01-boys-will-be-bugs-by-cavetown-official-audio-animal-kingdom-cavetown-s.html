{% raw %}Cavetown's &quot;Boys Will Be Bugs&quot; from the album Comet, part two of five in Cavetown's Animal Kingdom collaboration series.<br />© 2018 Cavetown<br /><br />Typically Comet moths aren't able to eat or drink, and die within just a few days, but Animal Kingdom's Comet is different.<br />On Venus Comet moths live full lives, but our Comet became trapped in a meteor when it swept through Venus' atmosphere and hurtled towards earth. Landing in a forest near a city, Comet ventured into the streets to find anything she could drink to stay alive in this new realm. <br />Strangely she was drawn exclusively to strawberry soda, and she would fly into vending machines to steal sips. <br />She has now settled into the forest, where she has assumed a motherly role to the animals there, diffusing tensions with her gentle manner and ensuring everyone is comfortable and happy. She's also the only one in the group who can read and understand human language from her experiences in the city, so this comes in handy whenever the animals need to venture into the urban unknown. <br /><br />Character design by Emerson Dellaero<br />Character concept by Robin Skinner<br /><br />iTunes/Apple Music ~ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2S5Kr9z">https://apple.co/2S5Kr9z</a><br />Spotify ~ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/2QYpRYj">https://spoti.fi/2QYpRYj</a><br />Bandcamp ~ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cavetown.bandcamp.com/">https://cavetown.bandcamp.com/</a><br />Amazon MP3 ~ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Qs7FdF">https://amzn.to/2Qs7FdF</a><br />Google Play ~ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ru52cn">http://bit.ly/2ru52cn</a><br /><br />I'm a dumb teen boy<br />I eat sticks and rocks and mud<br />I dont care about the government<br />and I really need a hug<br />I feel stupid (stupid) ugly (ugly)<br />Pretend it doesnt bother me<br />I'm not very strong but<br />I'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs<br /><br />It's getting cold down here underneath the weather<br />I skipped class to sit with you<br />I really like your spotty sweater if<br />ladybugs are girls<br />How do you make kids together<br />What's it like in a female world<br />I bet it's just so much better<br /><br />I just turned fourteen<br />and I think this year I'm gonna be mean<br />Don't mess with me I’m a big boy now and I'm very scary<br />I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate<br />Don't message me cause I wont reply, I wanna make u cry<br />Ain't that how its s’posed to be?
