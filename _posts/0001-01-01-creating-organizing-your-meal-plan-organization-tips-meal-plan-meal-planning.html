{% raw %}Meal planning was a tool I used to help me lower the cost of my food budget. Ultimately, it gave me an organized food plan to prepare a grocery list, use food that I already had, and made it convenient to cook at home.<br /><br />I am a monthly and weekly meal planner. What does this mean? Essentially, I like to create a meal plan every month, then every week I break it down into more detail and that's when I also go grocery shopping for that specific year.<br /><br />In this video, I walk you through my monthly meal plan, my weekly meal plan, as well as my recipe binder.<br /><br />CHAPTERS:<br />00:00 Introduction<br />01:00 My Monthly Meal Plan<br />02:59 My Weekly Meal Plan<br />04:40 How I Determine What Recipes To Use<br />05:57 My Recipe Binder<br /><br />‚û°Ô∏è MY RECIPE BINDER SLEEVES: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ITpKbX">https://amzn.to/3ITpKbX</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è MY FREE RECIPE ORGANIZATION WORKSHEETS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3E3BMfp">https://bit.ly/3E3BMfp</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è HOW I TRACK MY SPENDING: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3aIe89I">https://bit.ly/3aIe89I</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è HOW TO USE A BUDGET CALENDAR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2IzF2Vj">https://bit.ly/2IzF2Vj</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è FINDING YOUR WHY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3aJUryj">https://bit.ly/3aJUryj</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è THE BUDGET MOM'S FINANCIAL FREEDOM STEPS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3cfJXsp">https://bit.ly/3cfJXsp</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è HOW TO GET STARTED WITH THE CASH ENVELOPE METHOD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2vQJaO5">https://bit.ly/2vQJaO5</a><br />‚û°Ô∏è HOW TO CREATE A PLAN OF ATTACK TO PAY OFF DEBT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2wDETxF">https://bit.ly/2wDETxF</a><br /><br />ABOUT ME<br /><br />I'm the blogger behind <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebudgetmom.com.">https://www.thebudgetmom.com.</a> I have a rambunctious 6-year-old son, live in Washington, and I'm passionate about helping people with money management and personal finance.
