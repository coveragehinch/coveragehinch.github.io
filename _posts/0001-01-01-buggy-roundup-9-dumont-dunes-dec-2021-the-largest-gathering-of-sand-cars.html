{% raw %}The largest gathering of sand cars at Dumont Dunes is The Buggy Roundup! I started Buggy Roundup back in 2011 to bring all of the buggies of Dumont Dunes together into one big camp. It gives everyone a chance to meet other duners, hang out, and run the dunes together over a weekend when there's usually nobody else out there. Most people show up as strangers, get hooked, and end up leaving with a handful of new friends. <br /><br />For more Buggy Roundup information, photos, and trip reports, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dumontduneriders.com/">https://www.dumontduneriders.com/</a><br /><br />Like this video?
