{% raw %}Keep on Growing (Cover)<br />Derek and the Dominos<br />-------------------<br /><br />I was laughing, <br />Playing in the streets, I was unknowing; <br />I didn't know my fate. <br />Playing <br />The game of love, but never really showing; <br />I thought that love could wait. <br />I was a young man and sure to go astray. <br />You walked right into my life and told me love would find a way <br />To keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing. <br />I was standing, <br />Looking in the face of one who loved me, <br />Feeling so ashamed. <br />Hoping, <br />And praying, Lord, that she could understand me, <br />But I didn't know her name. <br />She took my hand in hers and told me I was wrong. <br />She said, you're gonna be all right boy, oh just as long <br />As you keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. <br />Maybe, <br />Someday baby, who knows where or when, Lord, <br />Just you wait and see. <br />We'll be walking, <br />Together hand in hand, alone forever; <br />Woman just you and me. <br />'Cause time is gonna change us, Lord, and I know it's true; <br />Our love is gonna keep on glowing and growing and it's all we gotta do. <br />Keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. <br />Keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing.{% endraw %}
