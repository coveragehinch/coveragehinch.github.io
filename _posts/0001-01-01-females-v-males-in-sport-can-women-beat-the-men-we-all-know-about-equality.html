{% raw %}We all know about equality of the sexes in day to day life. Why then is sport segregated? How close are the women to being able to compete against the men? Are there any sports where females outperform their male counterparts? Also, a history of world records in several mainstream sports.<br />Any thoughts on the subject? Comment below, I'd love to hear them.{% endraw %}
