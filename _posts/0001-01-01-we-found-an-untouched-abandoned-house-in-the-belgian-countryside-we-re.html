This quaint little house once used to be the home of the married couple Ernest &amp; Gabrielle. They lived a long and happy life together, had several children together, and reached the magical anniversary of 60 years of marriage until their health deteriorated and both of them eventually left this world. During their career, they won many awards at the national level related to pig farming.<br />Unfortunately, the kids don't exactly look back at their parents' house, and the condition of the property has deteriorated over the past few years due to roof leaks. The house has now become one of the so-called &quot;slum houses&quot; in Belgium and will one day be razed to the ground, after all the stuff from the inside has been removed and secured.<br />Before that happens, let's explore this simple yet charming home. <br /><br /><br />FOLLOW our SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />👍Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ExplomoYT/​">https://www.facebook.com/ExplomoYT/​</a><br />📸 Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/explomo_urb...">https://www.instagram.com/explomo_urb...</a><br />🐦Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/explomo_urbex​">https://twitter.com/explomo_urbex​</a><br />🎵TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/wgroxa/​">https://vm.tiktok.com/wgroxa/​</a><br /><br />All the music in this video is gathered through Epidemic Sound (ES) and Artlist.io<br /><br />Abandoned Belgium: We Found An Untouched Abandoned House in the Belgian Countryside<br />#abandoned​ #urbex​ #belgium{% endraw %}
