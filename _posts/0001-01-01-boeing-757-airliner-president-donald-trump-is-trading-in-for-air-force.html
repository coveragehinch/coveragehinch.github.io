{% raw %}Donald Trump is officially America's 45th President. Unlike his predecessors, the VC-25As that serve as Air Force One will not be Mr. Trump's first personal Boeing airliner.<br /><br />&quot;Trump Force One&quot; — as some have dubbed the jet — was one of the most visible symbols of his run for the Oval Office. However, Mr. Trump likes to call it the &quot;T-Bird,&quot; according to a Discovery Channel documentary featuring the plane. According the documentary, the Trump Boeing 757 reportedly cost a whopping $100 million. Admittedly, that figure seems highly exaggerated when compared to market prices.<br /><br />The President has owned the Boeing airliner — registration N757AF — since 2011 and has customized the aircraft to his liking. It's unclear what will become of the Trump 757. In all likelihood, the aircraft will be pressed into service for members of the Trump family as well as senior officials at the Trump Organization.<br /><br />Information Sources &amp; Images Credit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pastebin.com/JW2YdEgp">http://pastebin.com/JW2YdEgp</a>{% endraw %}
