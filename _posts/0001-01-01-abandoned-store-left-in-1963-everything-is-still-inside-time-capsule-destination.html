{% raw %}I Have been so lucky to explore some extraordinary places in my lifetime, but few even come close to this one. This is the 153 Mile Store, and it has sat perfectly preserved - full of unsold merchandise - since the day it closed in 1963. I grew up just down the road from this location, so I was always aware of it, but it was so much more than I ever expected.  Its rare that you get to see old artifacts in good condition, but this store is FULL of artifacts in literally brand new condition.  This store opened in 1900 and ran until 1963, when the owner died in the store behind the counter.  Shortly after that, the doors were closed and locked and it has sat just the same ever since.  The calendar behind the counter is still on the month and year that she died in the store. The store is located on a working ranch, so it has been kept in remarkable condition from the current owners of the ranch, but there has not been intention to open the store for public sale since the day that it closed.  <br />I am really honoured to have the chance to make this video for my community, my city and for the family members that have been involved in this amazing piece of history and story.  People have always said that I am an old soul, and I would have to agree.  I thoroughly enjoyed interviewing and chatting with some folks about a story that came and left, years before my parents were even born.  <br />This video could have easily been much longer, just because there is so much to see and learn, and the interviews were so interesting for me. I will be putting a bunch of extra content onto the Patreon page, because I want to share this all with you.  If you want to learn or see more, or you just want to support the channel, please head over to the Patreon page.  It really helps me out. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DestinationAdventure">https://www.patreon.com/DestinationAdventure</a><br /><br />Thank you to every single person that has supported on Patreon so far.{% endraw %}
