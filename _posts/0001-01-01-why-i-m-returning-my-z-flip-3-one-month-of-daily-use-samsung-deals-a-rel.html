Thank you all for watching! I appreciate you!<br /><br />ADDITIONAL REVIEW NOTES:<br />PROS<br /> Water resistant<br />$1000<br /> Feels and looks like a normal phone<br /> I feel the crease but I got used to it<br /> Use is more deliberate. Fewer distractions<br /> Screen is protected<br /> Great for propped up camera or flashlight<br /> Has reverse powershare and wireless charging<br /> You can charge wirelessly AND have a pop socket or case ring<br /> Samsung thought of a lot. Volume buttons reverse when you close the phone<br /> The phone stands up<br />Folding is actually really convenient for photos<br /> You CAN keep it open if you are sick of opening and closing it (screen is vulnerable)<br /><br />CONS<br /> No Samsung Dex on flip<br /> Magnet makes this stick to metal tables<br /> Two handed opening<br /> Cover screen is really cool, but largely impractical in photos because the aspect ratio is 90 degrees off<br /> Magnets - keep away from credit cards and hotel keys<br />Nothing sharp near the screen<br /> Canâ€™t really wirelessly charge while open (too long and off balance)<br /> No room for card/wallet on back<br /> BATTERY LIFE!!!<br /> Opening sound makes me nervous<br /> Microphone issue<br /><br />FEATURES<br /> What can you do on the outside screen?<br /> Can you open assistant?<br /> Can you control music?<br /> Selfie camera? Wide angle?<br />Swipe up to pay<br /><br />SPECS<br /> 8GB RAM<br />128GB<br />IPX8<br />Snapdragon 888<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />0:00 Why am I returning it?<br />0:55 Pros &amp; Cons<br />7:45 The Cover Screen<br />9:15 Big Drawback #1<br />10:25 The Reason I am returning it<br /><br />Protect yourself with PIA VPN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.privateinternetaccess.com/MikeOBrien">http://www.privateinternetaccess.com/MikeOBrien</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: This video is purely based on my experiences, research, and opinions.
