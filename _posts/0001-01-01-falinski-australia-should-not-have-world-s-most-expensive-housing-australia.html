{% raw %}Australia should not have the world’s most expensive housing because it has more land than every other continent in the world, says the chair of the Standing Committee on Economics Jason Falinski. <br /><br />“The biggest issue is that Australia shouldn’t have the most expensive housing in the world, it should have the least expensive housing in the world because we have more land in virtually every continent in the world, except for the penguins in the South Pole,” he told Sky News Australia. <br /><br />“The underlying issue is supply and that comes down to zoning laws. If you look at Sydney, which is the epicentre of this crisis, there are a number of issues that the planning laws provide but the biggest inhibitor to affordable housing in Sydney is Clover Moore because Clover Moore restricts supply in the CBD. <br /><br />“When there is no supply, economics 101 tells you there is only one place for the demand to go, which is in higher prices.{% endraw %}
