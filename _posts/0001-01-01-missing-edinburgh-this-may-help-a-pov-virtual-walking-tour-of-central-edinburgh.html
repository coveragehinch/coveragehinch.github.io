{% raw %}This was just a bit of an experiment, and not as easy to do as I first thought it would be when I woke up on a crisp December morning and decided to take you for a random walk around Edinburgh! So we'll call it 'Bonus Footage' :D<br /><br />I hope you find it relaxing and that it may bring back some happy memories from when you were here for real. It was just such a nice day it would have been a shame not to capture it!<br /><br />Just to let you know, it genuinely wasn't planned and I was actually a bit time restricted due to having a train to catch, so I miss a lot of cool famous places, but I still hope you'll find something interesting in it. <br /><br />Enjoy your walk! <br /><br />Filmed on 10th December 2021 in Edinburgh, Scotland.<br /><br />Hi, I’m Steve.
