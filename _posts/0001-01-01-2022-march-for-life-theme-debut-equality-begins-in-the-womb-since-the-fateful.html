{% raw %}Since the fateful Roe v. Wade decision, over 62 million unborn children have lost their lives to abortion, stripped of their most fundamental right - the right to life. In the 50 years since, we have peacefully marched against this grave human rights abuse. Join us for an unveiling of the 2022 March for Life Theme as we affirm the dignity of human life through the diverse lenses of scientific research in embryonic human development, legal analysis of this upcoming Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court Case, and commentary on our current cultural climate.<br /><br />#WhyWeMarch #MarchForLife #CreatedEqual{% endraw %}
