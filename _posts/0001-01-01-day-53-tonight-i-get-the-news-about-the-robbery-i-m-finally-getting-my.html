{% raw %}Headed back from New York and I’ll stop by the office for a min to see the crew, shuffle thru some inventory, and get caught up on wires. <br /><br />Tonight, off camera, I get the news about what happened to Marco, then I had to start making phone calls. <br /><br />After a little over a month wearing temporary teeth, I’m finally getting the permanent veneers put in. <br /><br />Thank you to Jeff Nguyen and the group over at Henderson Family Dental for making this process simple.{% endraw %}
