{% raw %}A brief photo montage at an attempt to capture Michael Henderson's magnificent contributions to music! With trailblazing successes in the fields of Funk, Fusion, Drum-n-Bass, and Jazz, this is truly a unique musician who's level of artistry knows no boundaries!  For quite some time it was believed that friend, Drummer and Super Producer Norman Connors was the voice on the beautiful Michael Henderson penned classic, &quot;You Are My Starship&quot;, when this is none other than the Bass Player himself!  Ooh!{% endraw %}
