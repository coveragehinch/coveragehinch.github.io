This ministry is dedicated to helping women literally ‚Äòwake up joyful‚Äô through Biblical truths, deeper awareness of their identity and worth in Christ and learning how to re-parent their inner child to break free of negative thinking, depression and anxiety that have kept them in bondage. My deepest desire is to see women heal from past pain and trauma so they can experience God‚Äôs abundant joy, peace and love! <br /><br />I also work privately with Christian women who desire to come into FULL agreement with who they are in Christ and live free from the past so they can shine His light in the world. I also create FREE downloadable resources to support women in navigating life in a more positive, joyful and courageous way! You can find all these resources on my website at www.wakeupjoyful.com<br />‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨<br />NOTE: The information contained on this YouTube Channel and the resources available for download/viewing through this YouTube Channel are for educational and informational purposes only.‚Äã All statements made in this video are expressions of the opinion of the speaker and should be regarded as such.
