{% raw %}&quot;In 2010, a high school acquaintance of mine named Nick had a brother who went missing. He has yet to be found. About a year later, this past October, Nick also went missing. The police acquired no evidence and gave up the search for him, just as they did with his brother. Until recently I believed that they were both gone for good. That was until this showed up at my doorstep... When I looked at the package I noticed that the return address was from Nick. The delivery man said that the package had been lost in the mail and was originally sent out almost three months ago, right around the time Nick went missing...&quot; <br />The contents of the box contained a number of things, most notably a camera with 6 memory cards of stored film.<br />&quot;I have a feeling that there is footage here that Nick wants me to see. But why me? We were just acquaintances...&quot;<br />All credits goes to Rise and Shine Productions<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/riseshineproductions">http://www.youtube.com/user/riseshineproductions</a><br />Also, here is the link to their facebook page<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Rise-and-Shine-Productions/136659863065297?fref=ts">http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Rise-and-Shine-Productions/136659863065297?fref=ts</a><br />Please, if you enjoy &quot;Just Acquaintances, please subscribe to their youtube channel and 'like' their facebook page.
