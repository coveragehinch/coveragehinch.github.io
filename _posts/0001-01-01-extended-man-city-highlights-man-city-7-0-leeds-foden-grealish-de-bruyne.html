{% raw %}Pep Guardiola’s side completely outplayed the visitors with a devastating attacking display which sent the defending champions four points clear at the top of the Premier League.<br /><br />Kevin De Bruyne scored a brace, with Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Riyad Mahrez, John Stones and Nathan Ake also on target.<br /><br />City dominated from start to finish and took the lead in the seventh minute when Foden volleyed home from the edge of the area to net the 500th league goal under Guardiola.<br /><br />The Catalan reached the milestone quicker than any other manager in the competition’s history and didn’t have to wait long for his 501st goal as Grealish headed home Mahrez’s cross to double our lead after 12 minutes.<br /><br />De Bruyne rifled past Illan Meslier to ensure we went in three goals to the good at half-time and Mahrez put the result beyond doubt four minutes after the restart when his low strike deflected off Junior Firpo to wrong foot Meslier in the Leeds goal.<br /><br />De Bruyne then scored the pick of the goals, crashing a 25-yard drive into the top of the net and Stones added a sixth with a fierce strike from close range after Meslier did well to keep out his initial attempt.<br /><br />Substitute Ake headed home from a Foden corner to complete the scoring.<br /><br />Watch the full match: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mancity.com/city-plus">https://www.mancity.com/city-plus</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=mancity">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=mancity</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.mancity.com">http://www.mancity.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/mancity">http://www.facebook.com/mancity</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/mancity">http://www.twitter.com/mancity</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/mancity">http://www.instagram.com/mancity</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mancity">https://www.tiktok.com/@mancity</a><br /><br />About the Official Man City YouTube Channel:<br /><br />Here you will find all the latest videos from Manchester City, including, all Premier League goals, highlights, behind-the-scenes footage, training and much more.<br /><br />Get closer to the likes of Jack Grealish, Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus, Raheem Sterling, Riyad Mahrez, Phil Foden and the rest of Pep Guardiola's team.{% endraw %}
