We're Eric Lagerstrom and Paula Findlay. We're both professional triathletes; we train for and race triathlon for a living. Thanks so much for subscribing and helping us keep triathlon fun.<br />#thattriathlonlife #herbalife24tri #triathlontraining<br /><br />This week we headed to Los Angeles to race the Herbalife 24 LA Triathlon. It's been a bucket list race for us for years, and it didn't disappoint! We kicked taper week off with a pizza party, then wrapped our last couple hard sessions, including a gravel ride through Ben's trail system in Bend, Oregon, where we live. Then we took a quick flight to LA, snuck in a swim at the LA84 swim center and crashed for the night. We swam at Venice Beach to preview the swim course, but otherwise we did't get to see much of the course due to how much traffic there is on the city streets you ultimately race on.<br /><br />Follow our adventures daily on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/that.triathlonlife">https://www.instagram.com/that.triathlonlife</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/eric_lagerstrom">https://www.instagram.com/eric_lagerstrom</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/paula_findlay">https://www.instagram.com/paula_findlay</a><br /><br />Transition Four is my video creation company:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/transition.four">https://www.instagram.com/transition.four</a><br /><br />Camera Gear we use:<br />Drone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://click.dji.com/AJ4CLLHkuqgWqYMvR9ggBg?pm=link">https://click.dji.com/AJ4CLLHkuqgWqYMvR9ggBg?pm=link</a><br />Our main camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1577838-REG/sony_ilce7sm3_b_alpha_a7s_iii_mirrorless.html">https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1577838-REG/sony_ilce7sm3_b_alpha_a7s_iii_mirrorless.html</a><br />Old Gopro: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33e2VK0">https://amzn.to/33e2VK0</a><br />New Gopro: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2sMSUY0">https://amzn.to/2sMSUY0</a><br />Dome: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34gufZA">https://amzn.to/34gufZA</a>{% endraw %}
