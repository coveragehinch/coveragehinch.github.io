{% raw %}GETTING INTO THE FESTIVE SPIRIT AT A GLORIOUS ENGLISH COUNTRY HOUSE: Christmas at Chatsworth// Happy Friday, Only one more week till Christmas to today we share our visit to Chatsworth House in the Peak District to see the gorgeous Christmas displays. Chatsworth is always worth a visit. It was used as a filming location for the Pride &amp; Prejudice film adaptation of 2005 with Keira Knighley and Matthew Macfadyen. It's a glorious English country house and the garden was designed by no other than Capability Brown. Remember our hotel room in our last video which was called Capability? Not only did we see the beautiful Christmas displays but stayed a longer for the illuminated walk which we can highly recommend. Wishing you a lovely weekend.
