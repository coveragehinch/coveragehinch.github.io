Collectively, they are responsible for billions of dollars in damages annually and often claim thousands of lives. River flooding, in particular, is widespread and devastating, causing large losses of property, economic stability, and human life. <br /><br />As global temperatures continue to increase due to climate change, flooding will become increasingly more frequent and deadly. A 2014 New York Times report estimates that one out of every forty people will be living in a flood-prone area by the end of the century if current climate trends continue. However, those affected by rising water levels are located disproportionately in poorer South and East Asian nations, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh. 9 out of 10 nations named “most at-risk” are in the report are in this region. Despite recent developments of advanced levees and warning systems, such nations are unable to implement such solutions due to financial or environmental barriers. Death tolls, injuries, and damages due to flooding will continue to increase if the problem of flooding is left unresolved.<br /><br />To help alleviate the destructive effects of floods, we propose nowo’s ark: an inexpensive device aimed at flood-prone countries for warning people about rising water levels before floods strike.<br /><br />Lid Demo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eDfrMc5Ty8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eDfrMc5Ty8</a><br /><br />Density Test: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ9SmkT_580">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ9SmkT_580</a><br /><br />GitHub: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/DevinMui/nowos-ark">https://github.com/DevinMui/nowos-ark</a><br /><br />Song: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Thx4kLPw4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Thx4kLPw4</a>{% endraw %}
