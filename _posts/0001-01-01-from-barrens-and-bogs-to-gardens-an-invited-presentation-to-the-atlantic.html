{% raw %}An invited presentation to the Atlantic Rhododendron and Horticultural Society on Nov 3, 2020. David P describes what was involved in developing a Bog and Barren &quot;pocket garden&quot; within his urban backyard garden on peninsular Halifax,  Nova Scotia, Canada.  The Bog and Barren garden emulates the small scale mosaic of different habitats found on rock barrens in Nova Scotia, with dryland and wetland species often occurring in close proximity within a small area. He advocates giving  the public access to barrens about to be pulverized to take  plants for horticultural use - if we cannot stop development on the barrens in the first place.   Introductory and closing remarks are by Bob Howard of the ARHS. Some related info is posted at www.versicolor.ca/rhodo{% endraw %}
