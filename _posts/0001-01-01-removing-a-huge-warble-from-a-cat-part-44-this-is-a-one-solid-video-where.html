{% raw %}This is a one solid video where you will see a cat who is presented by having a living creature under her chin and head, after a little more investigations, the veterinarian recognized that it's a Botfly larvae and needs to be treated and removed immediately, the vet had the help of an assistant who immobilized the cat's head and used some good forceps and removed it with ease by grabbing the tip and pulling it out, and of course the hole needs some care.<br /><br />See more of this awesome woman and probably veterinarian here In her TikTok:<br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdjAPyvH">https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdjAPyvH</a><br /><br />Note: All Videos Here On This Channel Have Been Allowed To Be Uploaded On It(except Commentary, it's Original And Added By Me With My Own Voice)<br /><br />Love Animals?
