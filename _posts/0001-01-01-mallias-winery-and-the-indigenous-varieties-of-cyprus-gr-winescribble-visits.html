{% raw %}WineScribble visits Mallias Winery/Ktima KEO and interviews the very experienced and knowledgeable agriculturist Timos Boyias, who talks to us about the indigenous grape varieties of Cyprus. These rare, local grapes nearly became extinct but were rescued by KEO winery. In order to determine how best to cultivate them, the team at KEO has also conducted extensive research around these varieties and the best methods of cultivation.{% endraw %}
