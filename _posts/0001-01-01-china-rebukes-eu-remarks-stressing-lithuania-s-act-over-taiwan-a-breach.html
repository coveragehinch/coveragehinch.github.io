{% raw %}Phoenix TV: A European Commission spokesperson said on November 21 that the EU does not regard the opening of a representative office from Taiwan in Lithuania as a breach of the EU's one China policy. &quot;We have made clear in contacts with China and in public statements that this is predominantly a bilateral matter between China and Lithuania, but also since the summer, the EU has stood by Lithuania in the face of sustained coercive measures from China&quot;, added the spokesperson. I wonder if China has any comment?<br /><br />Zhao Lijian: The merits of the Taiwan-related issue concerning Lithuania are plain and clear. Lithuania, in disregard of the Chinese government's solemn position, the broader interests of bilateral ties and the basic norms governing international relations, has allowed the establishment in Lithuania of the &quot;Representative Office&quot; bearing the name of Taiwan. This act openly creates the false impression of &quot;one China, one Taiwan&quot; in the world and renounces the political commitment made by Lithuania in the communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. This act in bad faith has created an egregious precedent internationally. The Lithuanian government must bear all the ensuing consequences.<br /><br />The remarks by the EU side disregard facts and obviously run counter to the commitment it made to the People's Republic of China upon establishing diplomatic relations in 1975. Sir Christopher Soames, then vice-president of the Commission of the European Economic Community (EEC), visited China in 1975. It was during this visit that China and the EEC agreed to establish official relations. On the Taiwan question, Sir Soames stated that &quot;all the Member States of the Community recognized the government of China and had taken positions with regard to the Taiwan question acceptable to the People's Republic&quot;. He also confirmed that &quot;the Community does not entertain any official relations with Taiwan or have any agreements with it&quot;. The EU side should honor its word instead of breaking faith.<br /><br />We urge Lithuania and the EU to truly abide by the one-China principle and fulfill their political commitment on Taiwan-related matters with actions in good faith. Those who think they can use Taiwan as a handy card to undermine China's interests have completely miscalculated. Such acts can never change the fact that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one and the same China. They will only further strengthen the Chinese people's resolve to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity and realize the complete reunification of the motherland.<br /><br />__________________<br />Powered by Shanghai Media Group, ShanghaiEye focuses on producing top-quality content for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube.<br />Nobody knows Shanghai better than us.<br />Please subscribe to us  ☻☻☻<br />__________________<br />For more stories, please click <br />■ What's up today in Shanghai, the most updated news of the city<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MNjpE4hspSVry8dR555getN">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MNjpE4hspSVry8dR555getN</a><br />■ Amazing Shanghai, exploring the unknown corners of the city,  learning the people, food and stories behind them<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MMVTWr-zIXjsS4hhSQPmyes">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MMVTWr-zIXjsS4hhSQPmyes</a><br />■ What Chinese people's lives are like during the post COVID-19 period<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MPrPTmIirpfgETu6VKVESXe">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MPrPTmIirpfgETu6VKVESXe</a><br />■ Views of foreign scholars on China and its affairs<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MO9ua_nSK6slRPdUl-ovjRe">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MO9ua_nSK6slRPdUl-ovjRe</a><br />■ Foreign faces in Shanghai, people living in this city sharing their true feelings<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MP0vJDSw23_1MCPJhAfGbiG">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MP0vJDSw23_1MCPJhAfGbiG</a><br />■ Mini-docs showing why China is the country it is today <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MOreRu2AbZ3ziIUyCcdBLwX">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MOreRu2AbZ3ziIUyCcdBLwX</a><br />__________________<br />☎Leave us messages if you have any suggestions or questions!<br />Thank you!{% endraw %}
