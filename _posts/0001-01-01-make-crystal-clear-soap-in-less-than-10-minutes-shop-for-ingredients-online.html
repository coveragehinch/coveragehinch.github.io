So make sure to check it!<br /><br />Ingredients for Crystal Clear Soap (Microwave HP Method)<br />A - Oil<br />Coconut Oil 140g<br />Stearic Acid 60g<br />Glycerin  400g<br />________<br />B - Lye<br />NaHO   34g<br />Distill Water 68g<br />________<br />C - Solvent<br />99% Alcohol 300g<br /><br />Step 1. Pour all ingredients in A into a big microwave safe bowl, warm 2-4 minutes until all melted.<br />Step 2. Mix B until dissolved, pour into A. Whisk until white clumps form.<br />Step 3. Continuous to whisk into mash potato texture.<br />Step 4. Pour C into the mixture.<br />Step 5. Covered with plastic wrap, microwave for 1 minutes<br />Step 6. Whisk until clear liquid form.<br />Step 7. Pour into plastic mold and wait over night.<br />This method is a none sugar method. It's less sweating than regular soap base. Because of the high amount of alcohol and water, it will shrink. I wouldn't suggest to remelt it like regular soapbase. Therefore if you need to add colors and scents do so before you pour it into the mold.<br /><br />FAQ: <br />1. What type of alcohol was used in this video?<br />A: Ethnol 99%<br /><br />2. If I don't have 99%, can I substitute with 90%  or 95%?<br />A: Yes you could, if you are using 90%, then increase the Alcohol amount by 9% which makes the alcohol amount into 327g, and decrease the distill water from lye solution to 68-27=41g. As for 95% alcohol, increase the Alcohol amount to 312g, and the water for lye solution would be 56g.<br /><br />3. Can I use this as a M&amp;P base?<br />A: this would not be a good recipe for M&amp;P. It would be hard to solidify again after remelt.<br /><br /><br />4. Can I be used right after it's done?<br />A: Yes it's a HP method that could be used right away. Be sure always check the pH. (pH should be around 8.5-9.5)<br /><br />5. Does it sweat when cured unwrapped?<br />A: It does sweat if you leave it unwrapped. However it doesn't sweat much compare to other recipe that contains sugar.<br /><br />6. Can I substitute the propylene glycol with Alcohol in this recipe?<br />A: You could try, but the amount needs to be adjust. Please experiment yourself.<br /><br />7. What will we use as citric acid STPP (POWDER - GRANULES)?<br />A: I used granule, but I guess it doesn't matter.<br /><br />8. Do you teach milk soap base?<br />A: Sorry not at this moment, but you could try to add milk powder into the recipe to see if it works for you.<br /><br />9. If I make it on a stove or slow cooker, what temperature should be achieved?<br />A: 80c ~ 100c (176F ~212F)<br /><br />At the end I wanted to say, I hope this video would be the inspiration for you! Be creative! You could try in your own way! Feel free to share it, use for your own purpose, I don't mind.  Share your thoughts here if you have a different way of making it!{% endraw %}
