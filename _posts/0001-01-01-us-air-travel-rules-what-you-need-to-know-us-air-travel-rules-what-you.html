{% raw %}US Air Travel Rules:  What you need to know<br /><br />âœˆ In this video:<br />0:00 US Air Travel Rules: What you need to know<br /><br />1:18 US Air Travel Rules: What you need to know<br /><br />The United States has lifted travel restrictions for fully vaccinated passengers starting 8 November.<br /><br />Visitors can now enter the US from over 30 countries that were previously banned.<br /><br />It marks the first time in roughly 18 months that non-essential travel has been permitted from 33 countries to the United States.<br /><br />The reopening, which comes ahead of the holiday season, is a major development for the travel industry, which has lost billions of dollars while the international borders were closed to specific countries.<br /><br />The US has maintained tight coronavirus travel restrictions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.<br /><br />The decision to lift them is a significant move towards a return to pre-pandemic.<br />...<br /><br />3:08 Non-US Citizens Allowed in the US<br /><br /><br />Anyone who has been fully vaccinated against coronavirus can now visit the US, providing they have a certificate to prove they are vaccinated.<br /><br />This update is particularly good news to those travelling from 33 countries previously banned from entering the US.<br /><br />Many of these banned countries are part of the US Visa Waiver Program (VWP).<br /><br />The decision to lift travel restrictions means citizens of these nations can visit the US visa-free once again by registering online with the ESTA.<br />...<br /><br />4:12 Returning US Citizens &amp; Lawful Permanent Residents<br /><br /><br />Vaccinated US citizens and lawful permanent residents will be required to present a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours prior to their departure for the US, regardless of their citizenship.<br /><br />Returning US residents who are unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated will be subject to stricter requirements than they are previously, and will need to produce a negative test taken no more than 24 hours before boarding their flight.<br /><br />4:52 Conditions for Visiting the US<br /><br /><br />All foreign adults must have a COVID-19 vaccination certificate to enter the US. Children under 18 are exempt.<br /><br />Other exceptions may be made for those with a legitimate medical reason.<br /><br />The certificate must show that the traveller received their final dose a minimum of 15 days before arriving in the United States.<br /><br />Accepted vaccines include the following: <br />* AstraZeneca<br />* Covishield<br />* Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson)<br />* Moderna <br />* Pfizer-BioNTech<br />* Sinopharm  <br />* Sinovac<br />*Covaxin<br /><br />Although CDC has not recommended the use of mix-and-match COVID-19 vaccine primary series, the CDC will accept vaccination records with combinations of acceptable COVID-19 vaccines.<br />...<br /><br />7:28 Travel Loopholes<br /><br /><br />Since half the world remains unvaccinated and vaccine distribution has been so skewed to rich countries, the current US administration is leaving a loophole for people who live in countries where vaccines are scarce.<br /><br />Check our blog post to see the 50 countries exempted from the vaccination requirement.<br /><br />Travellers from these 50 countries will need permission from the US government to travel to the US but it cannot be just tourism or business.<br />...<br />Are you ready to travel to the US?
