Welcome to history in the making! Bitcoin has finally skyrocketed through its all time high and it’s still pumping! It also looks like Ethereum is headed towards its ATH as well. The entire space is being absolutely sent right now! First, I’d like to congratulate everyone that held through all of the FUD and frustration. <br /><br />Currently, 100% of the people that purchased BTC at its last ATH and didn’t sell are officially in profit! Elton John isn’t the only Rocket Man out there right now. I’m sure our friend over at Guggenheim is kicking himself at the moment after seeing this epic price rise. Scott Minerd (Guggenheim’s CIO) sidelined himself out of BTC after a few failed predictions. Let’s hope that the fund itself still has some exposure to Bitcoin. <br /><br />Word to the wise: Don’t make the same mistake. Also, Mark and company are still masterminding Facebook’s entry into the crypto industry. It will be interesting to see how they plan on rolling out their metaverse, seeing as how FB is basically the poster-child for centralization. I’m also curious to see what the response from the crypto community will be. Great things are occurring with Animoca, Polkadot, and Terra as well. <br /><br />The moral of the story, is that life changing wealth is happening in real-time.This is what it’s about E.T Fam. Please don’t get caught sitting on the sidelines. Gather the information, plan the course of action that’s right for you, and execute!<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice!
