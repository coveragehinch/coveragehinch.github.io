{% raw %}So Yeah. I can remeber that day clearly. It was December 17. and me and my dad was waiting for nurs to call us to mom’s room. It was snowing heavily. My grandmother was babysitting my little sister becouse she was only 2 years old. We didn’t know If it’ll be girl or boy. My father was with mom when my brother was born but he didn’t saw him. It was great suprise. When We saw his born papers, we found out that he had a twin. Sadly it dies before it was born. My brother sometimes think about it. Once he said: „I kinda miss my brother.” Even If we never saw it, it was kinda sad for us. I think mom was the saddest of us. But we decided that taht’s how things should be and now we’re happy. <br /><br /><br />I don't like to see this as a Trend. It can be kinda sensitive. But for me it's better to show it then try to hide it. When you see this and something like that happend to you, then I'm really sorry. Remember taht you're not alone. Lot of families have gone througt this, but even if it hurts, try to be happy that your other sibling/you are alive. ❤️❤️❤️<br /><br /><br />Anyway, happy new year🥳{% endraw %}
