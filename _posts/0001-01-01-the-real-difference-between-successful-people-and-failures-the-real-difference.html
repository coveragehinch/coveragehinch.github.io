What is the cause of this emotion?” <br />And really, at the cause level being willing to admit when it's <br />insecurity, pettiness, jealousy, whatever the case may be, <br />being able to really truly admit <br />whatever deficiency, inadequacy, just general lameness that exists in your personality. <br />Like if you're willing to be honest about that, <br />then you can go, <br />“what is it that I'm lacking or believe I'm lacking or whatever that's causing me to have this cascade.” <br />And if you can nip that in the bud by changing your identity, your values, whatever,<br />your belief system, all the things that make that up <br />because you want to change that, <br />because you think that whatever emotional state you're having is disempowering, <br />then you can diminish the amount of time you experience that <br />and the idea being to start recognising the emotion very fast, <br />recognising what it is, <br />the cause and addressing that cause through what I call the mental Pachinko machine which is{% endraw %}
