{% raw %}So many artefacts lie beneath the Thames mud waiting to be exposed by the gradual erosion of the layers of mud. I was fortunate to spot a white line on the mud a little while ago and decided to investigate.  What I uncovered was some advice which if not followed could mean life or death.  I wonder who threw this sign in the mud and what happened to contents of the box upon which it once was attached! <br /><br />On this video, join me for an outing on the River Thames as I search for history eroding from the mud. Each object has a story and a history just waiting to be explored in more depth.  Then back to the studio to find out a bit more about what was found. And maybe you can also provide me with some details on my finds.<br /><br />In this video I also explain that I am going to be selling my glass fish on my kofi site and you you can find the link to my site here:-<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/nicolawhitetidelineart/shop">https://ko-fi.com/nicolawhitetidelineart/shop</a><br /><br />Also you can find Wendy Meister's folksy shop here if you want to take a look at her wonderful range of jewellery inspired by the Thames.
