{% raw %}&quot;Done Without&quot; is an underground one-man band from Zhytomyr, Ukraine.<br /> It is difficult to say about genre...At present moment I am experimenting with noise-rock and trying to find my own sound.  <br />Done Without  link : <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/DoneWithout">https://linktr.ee/DoneWithout</a><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Track reflects a lot of things and changes all around...<br />Recording was began from playing jaw harp and making backround noises on my mixer.<br />Later on it became like a growing of concept.<br />Of course...full mood of this track can be reached in conjunction with track art.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Credits :<br />All music and noises : by Done Without<br />Track Art : by Artem Bashev{% endraw %}
