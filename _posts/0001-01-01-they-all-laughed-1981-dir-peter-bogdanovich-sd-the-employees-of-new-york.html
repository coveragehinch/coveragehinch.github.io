{% raw %}The employees of New York City's Odyssey Detective Agency can't seem to prevent themselves from getting over-involved in their clients' lives. When aging gumshoe John Russo (Ben Gazzara) is assigned to trail an Italian millionaire's wife, Angela (Audrey Hepburn), he inevitably falls for her continental charm. His partner, Charles (John Ritter), is similarly unable to keep his hands off the woman he's trailing -- a winsome cheating spouse named Dolores (Dorothy Stratten).<br /><br />Director: Peter Bogdanovich<br /><br />Ben Gazzara<br />Audrey Hepburn<br />John Ritter<br />Colleen Camp<br />Patti Hansen<br />Dorothy Stratten<br />George Morfogen<br />Blaine Novak<br />Sean Ferrer<br />Linda MacEwen<br /><br />Full movie<br />Standard definition<br /><br />Note: Video blocked in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria{% endraw %}
