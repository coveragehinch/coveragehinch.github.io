{% raw %}On Mondays, I have 7 hours of lectures - it's tiring but I like it because it means I get all of Tuesday off, haha 😊<br />I study maths at the University of Nottingham, and I'm in my second year. We normally have around 17 hours a week of lectures.<br /><br />Please note that music is used as background music throughout this video.<br /><br /><br />My instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/savandwiches/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/savandwiches/?hl=en</a><br /><br /><br />Subscriber count: [5,956]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Credits:<br />Thanks to Eva grace for the first half of my intro, and Taylor Layman for the second bit. <br />Intro music: Elijah Who- My new love{% endraw %}
