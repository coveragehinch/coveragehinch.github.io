{% raw %}Raider's Solo Aim Training Map: 6531-5731-1207<br />Teadoh's Chapter 3 Warm Up: 7264-2987-8032<br />Pandvil's FFA Realistic PvP: 0563-9687-6084<br />Finest 1v1 Realistic Chapter 3: 7950-6306-4857<br /><br />In this video, I show off four of the best creative maps to improve your mechanics and overall skill in Fortnite Chapter 3. I haven't had too much fun in arena this season due to the current weapon meta, so I have been grinding different creative maps to improve and get better at the game. These include Raider464's solo aim trainer, Finest 1v1 Realistic with new Chapter 3 locations, Realistic PvP by Pandvil, and Teadoh's Chapter 3 Warm Up. My favorite map is definitely the aim trainer (Raider's aim map) since it's easily the best creative aim training map. All creative map codes will be down in the description below, so let me know which one you like and make sure to subscribe if this helped! <br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:45 Raider464's Solo Aim Trainer<br />7:57 Teadoh's Chapter 3 Warm Up<br />14:49 Pandvil's Realistic PvP<br />18:52 Finest's 1v1 Realistic Map<br />23:11 Conclusion<br /><br />As always, if you enjoyed the video feel free to leave a like on the video and subscribe to the channel to stay up-to-date with my content.
