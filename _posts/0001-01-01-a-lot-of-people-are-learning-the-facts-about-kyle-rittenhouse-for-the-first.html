{% raw %}Recastled CEO Kosha Gada says a lot of people are finally “learning facts” about Kyle Rittenhouse “for the first time” following his acquittal and interview on Fox News.  <br /><br />It comes after the 18-year-old was found not guilty of killing two people and wounding a third during a racial justice protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year. <br /><br />Ms Gada said, “half the country” who watched the judicial process play out were not surprised by the way Mr Rittenhouse conducted himself during his interview with Tucker Carlson. <br /><br />However, she told Sky News host Andrew Bolt there were many others who had only listened to the &quot;synopsis” provided by much of the media, celebrities and politicians, which sometimes even painted him as a white supremacist.  <br /><br />“So, for them, there was sort of a big disconnect, I think if they weren't read up on the details of this,” she said.  <br /><br />“And I think with the verdict and now this interview, I think a lot of people are learning facts that have been known for a long time for the first time, and it’s casting him in a different light.”{% endraw %}
