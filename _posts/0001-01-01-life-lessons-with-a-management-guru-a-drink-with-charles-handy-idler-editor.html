{% raw %}Idler editor Tom Hodgkinson chats to management expert Charles Handy. <br /><br />Philosopher and Idler magazine contributor Charles Handy  is regularly rated in the Thinkers 50 list of the most influential living management thinkers. Handyâ€™s books on management have sold over a million copies and have changed the way we view business and society. His latest book, 21 Letters, is now available in paperback and on audiobook. Charles suffered a stroke in 2019 following the death of his wife Liz in a car crash in 2018. He is 89.<br /><br />In this chat, Handy describes his career transition from Shell oil to management guru and self-professed 'storyteller'. Despite his agent at the time begging him not to give up the day job, Handy became a full-time writer, 'mainly because my wife thought it would be quite nice to be a writer's wife'. <br /><br />Charles's new book 21 Letters on Life and its Challenges is available here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://uk.bookshop.org/books/21-letters-on-life-and-its-challenges/9781786090973">https://uk.bookshop.org/books/21-letters-on-life-and-its-challenges/9781786090973</a><br /><br />This conversation was recorded as part of the Idler's weekly online event, A Drink with the Idler.
