{% raw %}Demand for rapid antigen tests across the country has been outstripping supply, leading to sellouts at supermarkets and pharmacies as infection numbers soar and governments move to endorse the tests.<br /><br />The Prime Minister said the states were responsible for securing their own rapid tests but the federal government was spending an extra $375 million to secure a further 50 million for the national medical stockpile.<br /><br />Sky News Australia discussed the issue with Roche Diagnostics Australia Managing Director Alison Rossiter.<br /><br />Ms Rossiter said the best way to get through the pandemic is if every Australian has equal access to the test that they need.<br /><br />&quot;If we approach this in a very sensible way and we work together and we don't go and hoard a test and just take a test when we need a test ... I think we'll get through the pandemic in a much simpler and smoother way,&quot; she told Sky News Australia.{% endraw %}
