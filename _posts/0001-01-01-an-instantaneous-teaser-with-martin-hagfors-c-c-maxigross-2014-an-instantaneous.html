This musical adventure started exactly when when Martin landed in Italy: the plan was to record an album and go on a tour within a month. And this is exactly what happened: a real “instantaneous journey”.<br />Maxigross and Hagfors met for the first time directly in the studio, where they re­arranged and recorded six Hagfors's songs. Right after the super group left for a two­weeks tour all over Italy.<br />Now that the EP is ready to be published, Martin Hagfors &amp; C+C=Maxigross, will get together again for a bunch of concerts in Italy, to bring this instantaneous and genuine psych folk experience to as many people as possible. <br />This group of musicians, with different origins and age (Martin was born in 1960, whereas Maxigross are in their twenties), found a special connection during this collaboration. The meeting point was the love they share for folk rock, for the spontaneity of live recordings, for the use of vocal harmonies and vintage instruments. This all led to a gentle albeit acid psychedelia, that reminds the cosiness of a wooden house and a friendly and domestic atmosphere. And this is exactly the environment in which the album was recorded: C+C=Maxigross and Hagfors spent a week in a house on the mountains, in front of a faboulous valley and next to the fireplace. During this time local food was always ready to be grilled, glasses were always full of Valpolicella wine and local musicians were invited to give their contribution. That's how Silva, aka Phill Reynolds, guitarist and songwriter from the near city of Vicenza, gained a fundamental role for this EP, playing vocal harmonies, banjo and different guitars, included the long solo in “Astrodome” that close the EP.<br />In these six songs, that go from the folk with a British reminiscence of “Maximum Amount” and “Coffee or Cigarettes”, though the country and acid folk of songs like “Country Chris” and “Company Oil”, to the last song “Astrodome”, with a mellow and soft beginning and a surprising Crazy Horse­ish end, you will feel the importance of this intense experience. <br />C+C=Maxigross always try to look for new inspiration through collaborations and exchanges. In this case Hagfors brought the experience of the best Norwegian musical scene (like Motorpsycho and Jaga Jazzist) and Maxigross shared the love for their native place and the local musical scene, with whom they are deep involved. In fact, C+C=Maxigross own the label Vaggimal Records and are involved with the organization of several events, included a psychedelic festival on the mountains around Verona: the Lessinia Psych Fest, who hosted, in a special place on high altitude, besides Jennifer Gentle and many Italian acts, the guitarist and singer Miles Cooper Seaton, well know for his band Akron/Family. This is more than a simple journey, this is &quot;An Instantaneous Journey with Martin Hagfors &amp; C+C=Maxigross&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br />The lineup of this tour: <br />- Martin Hagfors: ­ vox, ac &amp; el guit <br />- Filippo Brugnoli: ­ bass, vox <br />- Niccolò Cruciani: ­ drums, vox <br />- Tobia Poltronieri:­ el guit &amp; ac guit, vox{% endraw %}
