Lung Cancer<br />Lung and bronchial cancer is one of the most common cancers. At least one in 13 men in the U.S. will get it at some stage of their lives. For women, itâ€™s 1 in 16. If youâ€™re 65 years or older, itâ€™s an even more common occurrence. <br /><br />2. Colorectal Cancer<br />This is another common type of cancer. About 1 in 20 people in the U.S. end up getting colorectal cancer at some point in their lives. <br /><br />3. Breast Cancer<br />Breast cancer occurs because of a clone or a single transformed cell. It takes a longer time for these cells to become fully active.<br /><br />4. Pancreatic Cancer<br />While not as common as the types of cancers we just talked about, pancreatic cancer does occur among 1 in 67 people in the U.S. Itâ€™s still one of the more deadly diseases you can get. This cancer acts quickly, and can leave you with painful symptoms before becoming fatal.<br /><br />5. Prostate Cancer<br />This is another cancer youâ€™ve probably heard quite a bit about. Thatâ€™s because itâ€™s just so common. So much so, that one 1 in 7 people will end up suffering from it at some point in their lives. Men are particularly vulnerable, especially after the age of 50. Prostate cancer is most common in men over 65.<br /><br />For more information, please watch the video until the very end.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/">https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/</a>{% endraw %}
