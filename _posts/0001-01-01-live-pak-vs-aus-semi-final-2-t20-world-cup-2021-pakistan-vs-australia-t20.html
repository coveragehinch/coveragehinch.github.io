Even amongst the panoply of inexplicable heartbreak Pakistan cricket has subjected its followers to, Gros Islet in 2010 commands a unique psychologically damaging place.<br /><br />A semi-final Pakistan were so convinced they had won they went half the second innings going through the motions saw itself wrenched from their hands by a freakish innings from Michael Hussey. The 22 runs he plundered off Saeed Ajmal's final four balls unfortunately became a defining moment of sorts in the spinner's T20 career.<br /><br />It especially stung Pakistan for two reasons. One, it drew the curtains on the first truly great cricket team of the nascent T20 World Cup era. Second, it established a principle yet to be violated: Australia don't lose to Pakistan in an ICC knockout game. Aaron Finch's men have the chance to extend that dominance further when they take on Pakistan - arguably the team to beat this tournament, as they were in 2010 - in the second semi-final.<br /><br />Coming into the World Cup, Australia were plagued by concerns around their form. The batting order felt all wrong; they were too many anchors and openers jammed into the middle order. Josh Phillipe's non-selection seemed to compound the problem of too few power hitters, while the express pace Australia packed in their fast bowling attack didn't look as if it was built for the UAE.<br /><br />But since the tournament started, it turned out Finch and David Warner have ensured there's little the lower order has needed to do, while Mitchell Marsh appears to have found form flying in the face of historical evidence. Mitchell Starc and co. have demonstrated they aren't one-trick ponies, while the spinners - Adam Zampa in particular - has been one of the performers of the tournament.<br /><br />Teams:<br /><br />Pakistan Squad: Mohammad Rizwan(w), Babar Azam(c), Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Hafeez, Shoaib Malik, Asif Ali, Shadab Khan, Imad Wasim, Hasan Ali, Haris Rauf, Shaheen Afridi, Mohammad Nawaz, Haider Ali, Mohammad Wasim Jr, Sarfaraz Ahmed<br /><br />Australia Squad: David Warner, Aaron Finch(c), Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Steven Smith, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade(w), Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood, Kane Richardson, Ashton Agar, Mitchell Swepson, Josh Inglis{% endraw %}
