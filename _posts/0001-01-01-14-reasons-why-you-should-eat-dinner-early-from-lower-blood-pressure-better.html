Weight Loss: Restricting your meal intake in the window of 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. can reduce your overall calorie intake drastically because the time you have for eating has come down. Also a longer duration of overnight fast, helps with increasing fat loss. This is because your body gets enough time to reach a state of ketosis. <br /><br />2. Lower Heart Attack Risk: This oneâ€™s an especially important advantage. In general, when you sleep, your blood pressure decreases by nearly 10 percent. This allows your body to rest. In the morning, before you wake up, it begins to increase again. <br /><br />3. Better Digestion: Not waiting for dinner until right before you sleep gives more time to your food for digestion, no matter how heavy your meal is. When you sleep soon after eating, your body doesnâ€™t get enough time to digest food. The digestive system gets slow as a result, causing you to experience gut trouble. Slow digestion causes you to feel bloated, uncomfortable and possibly even full when you wake up.<br /><br />4. Youâ€™ll Sleep Better: Heartburn caused by eating near bedtime can interfere with restful sleep. Eating late, particularly large amounts can also disturb your sleep by causing abdominal discomfort. Drinking too many liquids before bed, like milk, juice or soup and the like can lead to frequent waking to relieve your bladder. <br /><br />For more information, please watch the video until the very end.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Medical Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i">https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i</a>{% endraw %}
