We returned the next morning to bask more in the spiritual glow of Sri Harmandir Sahib that is not only a central religious place of the Sikhs, but also a symbol of human brotherhood and equality.  Notwithstanding the teeming masses that converge here all times of the day, there is a certain peace that envelopes the mind when one spends time here. In this vlog, we have made a humble attempt to share certain aspects of our spiritual experience at this unique temple that embraces people of all caste, creed and faith. üôèüôè<br /><br />Don‚Äôt forget to like, share and subscribe to our second channel #kripalamanna to stay tuned for more from our Amritsar food tour.<br /> <br />See you on the next one.<br /> <br />Follow me:<br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kripalamanna/">https://www.instagram.com/kripalamanna/</a><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/gourmetbiker/">http://facebook.com/gourmetbiker/</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/kripalamanna">http://twitter.com/kripalamanna</a><br />Linked In <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/kripalamanna">https://in.linkedin.com/in/kripalamanna</a><br /><br />ADDRESS - Golden Temple Rd, Atta Mandi, Katra Ahluwalia, Amritsar, Punjab 143006<br />LOCATION TAG - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/x4uk2W3mBnA52Duq5">https://goo.gl/maps/x4uk2W3mBnA52Duq5</a><br />TIMINGS - The temple is open 24 hours.<br />Note: To make the most of your spiritual experience, try to visit the Golden Temple at least twice during your stay in the city.
