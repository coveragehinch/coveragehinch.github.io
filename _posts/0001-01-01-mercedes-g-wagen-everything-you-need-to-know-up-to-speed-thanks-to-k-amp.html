{% raw %}Thanks to K&amp;N for sponsoring today’s video. Head on over to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://knfilters.com/donut">http://knfilters.com/donut</a> for special discounts!<br /><br />The Mercedes G-Wagen is one of the most capable off-roaders ever built. You might not know that. Because somewhere along the way this badass military mover became a hyper-luxurious status symbol for fancy folks, who’ll probably never take them off the pavement. How did this happen? And is the 2022 G-Wagen as capable as its military ancestors? Find out with host James Pumphrey as he dives into the odd saga of the Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen!<br /><br />High-five to Ryan Hailey for the edit.
