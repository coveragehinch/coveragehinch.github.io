{% raw %}Crocodiles are apex predators that don’t have many enemies willing to take them on. Even lions will avoid scuffles with the massive reptiles, if necessary. Crocodiles will attack whatever comes their way. If you want to see crocodiles causing havoc, you need to see this, as we count down 15 epic hunting moments of huge and merciless crocodiles.<br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► shorturl.at/krBX9 <br /><br />Watch our “15 Most Fearless Dog Breeds in the World”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/YsPFDhziVos">https://youtu.be/YsPFDhziVos</a><br />Watch our “12 Splendid Jackal Hunting And Fighting Moments”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/881hIeH3pYY">https://youtu.be/881hIeH3pYY</a><br />Watch our “Top 12 Cheetah Chases Caught On Camera”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/baYChbR18no">https://youtu.be/baYChbR18no</a><br /><br />Crocodile Attack Gazelles<br /><br />When one of the gazelles is captured, it makes a sacrifice for the sake of the others, allowing them to cross the river. These three are the first to cross the river, but they are all knocked out when they see an armada of crocodiles charging straight at them. Five gazelles are killed in less than ten seconds by the reptiles. The crocodile snatching this gazelle is truly monstrous. Look at how big this thing is! Because he was slow to arrive, most of the gazelles made it back, but one of them died. This gazelle is captured by the crocodiles, allowing the others to cross without being snatched. Those gazelles were fortunate enough that their friend kept the crocodiles busy, allowing them to cross the river unharmed. I'm not sure why some of these gazelles cross where the crocodiles are. I understand they must cross, but what's the rush? You're risking your life, so take your time and stack the deck in your favor.<br /><br />Crocodile Attack On Python<br /><br />In this video, a massive crocodile is slicing up a python, indicating it will be a grilling snake for dinner on this day. Based on the crocodile's size, I don't think the python had a chance. This video depicts a fight between an alligator and a python underwater. The alligator appears to have the upper hand when it grabs the snake in its mouth, but that doesn't last long after the snake frees itself and flees his snake is coiled around this crocodile, but the crocodile does not appear to be bothered by it. If he's hurting by keeping his mouth open like that, he's in big trouble. A massive alligator's bite can generate approximately 2000 pounds of force; a well-directed bite on the head of a python will kill it almost instantly. In contrast, the alligator has taken on more than it can handle. The snake is far too large to eat whole. When the alligator is submerged, it will be able to bite off deteriorated flesh. It sounds like a perfect Saturday afternoon picnic by the lake. This python gets a little too close to this crocodile and pays the price. The crocodile crushes the snake's head, but don't think it's the end of the road for the python. Following this exhausting battle, an unusual turn of events occurs, and the alligator relinquishes control of the python. The Burmese python can scare an alligator into fleeing on rare occasions, and this is one of them.{% endraw %}
