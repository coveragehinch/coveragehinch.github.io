{% raw %}Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs are drugs with analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects .i.e. reducing pain, fever and inflammation.<br /><br />The most common traditional NSAIDs include:<br /><br />· Aspirin<br /><br />· Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, Motrin IB)<br /><br />· Naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve)<br /><br />· Nabumetone (Relafen)<br /><br />There are three main categories of NSAIDs, which include:<br /><br />· salicylates<br /><br />· traditional NSAIDs<br /><br />· COX-2 selective inhibitors<br /><br />How do they work?<br /><br />NSAIDs work by preventing an enzyme from performing its function. An enzyme is a protein that triggers changes in the body. The enzyme, known as COX (cyclooxygenase) has two forms, COX- 1 and COX-2.<br /><br />COX-1 protects the stomach lining from harsh acids and digestive chemicals; it also helps maintain kidney function. Meanwhile, COX-2 is produced when joints are injured or inflamed.<br /><br />Since traditional NSAIDs block the actions of both, COX-1 and COX-2, the chances of stomach disorders and bleeding really increase.<br /><br />As a consultant in pain medicine at the Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust in London and Medical Director of the London Pain Clinic <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.londonpainclinic.com/">http://www.londonpainclinic.com/</a> , Dr Chris Jenner works daily with patients who suffer from some of the most common, painful and yet misunderstood conditions to affect people around the world today. <br /><br />Alongside a raft of professional qualifications and more than 15 years’ experience in the specialised field of pain medicine, Dr Jenner possesses a true passion for his subject, a fact which is not only evident through his commitment to using the very best cutting-edge treatments, but also through his desire to understand the impact of acute and chronic pain on the everyday lives of his patients.<br /><br />Dr Jenner’s experience in treating conditions such as spinal pain, fibromyalgia and arthritis has led him to become one of the leading authorities in his field.
