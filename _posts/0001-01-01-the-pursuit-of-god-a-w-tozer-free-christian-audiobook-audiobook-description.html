{% raw %}Audiobook Description:<br />To have found God and still to pursue Him is a paradox of love, scorned indeed by the too-easily-satisfied religious person, but justified in happy experience by the children of the burning heart. Saint Bernard of Clairvaux stated this holy paradox in a musical four-line poem that will be instantly understood by every worshipping soul:<br /><br />We taste Thee, O Thou Living Bread,<br />And long to feast upon Thee still:<br />We drink of Thee, the Fountainhead<br />And thirst our souls from Thee to fill.<br /><br />Come near to the holy men and women of the past and you will soon feel the heat of their desire after God. Let A. W. Tozerâ€™s pursuit of God spur you also into a genuine hunger and thirst to truly know God.<br /><br />Updated Edition. NASB Bible text.
