Bush, often called the H-2A visa program - this VISA helps employers who anticipate a lack of available domestic workers to bring foreign workers to the U.S. to perform temporary or seasonal agricultural work including, but not limited to, planting, cultivating, or harvesting labor.<br /><br />Depending on the type of work you need, temporary or seasonal agricultural work can happen on farms, plantations, ranches, nurseries, greenhouses, orchards, or other similar locations.<br /><br />And we also talk to workers, they would tells us about their story and the benefits of this visa.<br /><br />#Farmer #Farming #HowTo #Visa #OwyheeProduce #Immigrants #GeorgeWBush #H2A #H2AVisa #FarmWord #MigrantLabot #FieldWorker{% endraw %}
