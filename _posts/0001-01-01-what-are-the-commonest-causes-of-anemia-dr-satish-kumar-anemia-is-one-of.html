{% raw %}Anemia is one of the commonest disorders seen by a physician and a haematologist. The word anemia means low haemoglobin. There are many causes of anemia including iron deficiency, Vitamin B12 deficiency, haemolytic anaemias, bone marrow disorders etc. The commonest cause of anaemia in practise is iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anaemia is not a diagnosis. We need to find out the cause of iron deficiency anemia and the cause of iron deficiency anaemia varies according to age, in children it is due to worm infestations or dietary habits. In young children it is due to menstrual problems. In elderly people, it may be due to blood loss form the food pipe. So we need to find out the exact cause of anemia and also treat the cause of anaemia to complete the treatment of anaemia. Every case of anaemia has to be investigated and managed thoroughly.{% endraw %}
