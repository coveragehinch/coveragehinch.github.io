And theres no sign of it to be slow down.In fact, it is speeding up.<br />Here we are going to talk about those 7 scientific discoveries of 21st century, which will change the world.<br /><br />1. 5d data storage<br /><br />A small disc-shaped device which is capable to withstand in 1000 degrees temperature and can hold up to 360 tb of data for billions of years.<br />These discs are made of nano-structured glass, and data which is stored in it can be revived using femtosecond laser writing.<br />And the most amazing thing is that it can store data for upto 13.8 billion years.<br /><br />2. Planet 9<br /><br />Researchers at Caltech have found<br />mathematical evidence suggesting there may be a Planet X in our solar system, which is far beyond Neptune. The planet is predicted to be the 5 to 10 times of our earth. And it orbits 400 to 800 times farther from the Sun compared to earth.<br /><br />3.Recycled Space Rockets<br /><br />SpaceX made history in 2017 when it<br />successfully launched the firstever recycled rocked ship into space. After 6 months, the unmanned falcon rocket was launched for the second time in December 2017.<br />This technology has already reduced the cost of launch missions to space. It may open the way for future for space travel which is not affordable for everyone today.<br /><br />4.First successful head transplant<br /><br />In 2016 an Italian scientist named Dr. Sergio Canavero, surprised the world by transplanting one monkeys heat onto another monkeys body.<br />Each monkeys blood vessels, spine and neuro-systems were connected using polyethylene glycol.<br /><br />5.3d printed organs<br /><br />3d printing is an amazing invention of all time. Scientists were trying to recreate the bodys complex vascular network using 3d printer. And this year they found the solution. In May 2019, they successfully printed a lung which took its first breath.<br /><br />6.Animal clonning<br /><br />The first successful genetic clone of an animal was born before 22 years. Since then scientist have successfully cloned pigs, deer, cats, mice etc. We are getting good at cloning animals. This technology has helped to increase the number of endangered animals population.<br />And we could use this technology to bring back now-extinct animals.<br /><br />7.Growing babies in plastic bags<br /><br />Just before 2 years Scientists in China<br />managed to keep a prematurely-born lamb alive for 4 weeks by growing it in an artificial womb which looks like a plastic bag. The bag was named as BioBag. This might help human babies born prematurely to have better chance of survival by allowing them to grow for an extended period in BioBags before entering the world.<br /><br />              FAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER<br /><br />* Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.Â <br /><br />- This video has no negative impact on the original worksÂ <br />- This video is also for research and commenting purposes.<br />- It is not transformative in nature.<br />- we only used bits and pieces of videos to get the point across where necessary.<br /><br />If you have any issues with our &quot;Fair Use&quot;, please contact us directly, for an amicable and immediate attention. <br /><br />mdiggersyt@gmail.com<br /><br /><br />invitation homes<br /><br />invention<br /><br />invention help<br /><br />invention ideas<br /><br />invention by an african american<br /><br />invention of camera<br /><br />invention printing press<br /><br />invention of computer<br /><br />invention define<br /><br />invention definition<br /><br />invention of television<br /><br />invention from the industrial revolution<br /><br />invention in the industrial revolution<br />#invention #innovation #science #scientists #space #spacex #creation{% endraw %}
