{% raw %}In the past 30 years, China has been changing its appearance rapidly. High-rise buildings of all kinds are springing up in cities, not only in metropolitan areas but also in small cities that are in the third or fourth tier. In addition to buildings, various large bridges and sea bridges have been built throughout the country. <br />High-speed railways and highways are connecting cities. But with the passage of time, under these shiny appearances, more and more problems began to appear, so the Chinese-style proper term &quot;tofu dregs construction&quot; was born.<br /><br />Have questions?
