{% raw %}I'm joined by my friend Christina Minenna (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.chess.com/member/tigerswithoutstripes)">https://www.chess.com/member/tigerswithoutstripes)</a> for the very first Chess Boot Camp club tournament, to celebrate (coincidentally) hitting 5000 channel subscribers! Three hours just fly by, as we commentate on a variety of games from players ranging between the low-100s up to almost 2000! Lots of fun, and plenty of insights to be gained.<br /><br />Book a 1-hour online chess lesson with me here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://calendly.com/benhunt/chess-lesson">https://calendly.com/benhunt/chess-lesson</a><br /><br />Follow me on Chess.com: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.chess.com/member/benhunt72">https://www.chess.com/member/benhunt72</a>{% endraw %}
