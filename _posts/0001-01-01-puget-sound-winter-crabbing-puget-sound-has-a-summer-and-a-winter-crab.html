{% raw %}Puget Sound has a summer and a winter crab season. Winter is my favorite! Much fewer boats, open 7days a week, and a great excuse to get out on a brisk Autumn day. <br /><br />Shingo and I head to Seattle (Marine Area 10) to get the crab! Will we get the crab? Or will they defend themselves somehow?!{% endraw %}
