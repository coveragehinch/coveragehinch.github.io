{% raw %}Welcome to the channel today we are going to show you how we enclose our screen porch. In the past we have used vinyl and hung it up either straight to the wood or sewing cloth on it in running a pipe through it. However the wind tears up the vinyl and it ends up tearing and falling off before the end of the season. I found some 96 inch long shower curtains. And we are going to use those and hang them from conduit. This is a cheap and hopefully a long lasting solution to enclosing our screen porch.<br /><br />Thank you for watching please subscribe hit the bell if you havenâ€™t already.{% endraw %}
