{% raw %}This segment is is Part 2.11 of the series:<br />“Why No Stories = No Quran?”<br />How to extract Abrahamic Locution from Zikr (QurꜤānic Stories &amp; Parables)?<br /><br />This segment is one of the most important segments on this channel! Get ready to hear something you have not heard before!<br /><br />If you are interested in learning about the real story of Jesus and his disciples, this video segment addresses this issue.<br /><br /><br />In This Segment:<br />• Understanding the critical story of ‘Ḥawāriy-yūn’<br />• 3 key paragraphs:<br />o Sūrah Āli-Ɛimrān (Sūrah 3)<br />o Sūrah Al-MāꜤidah (Sūrah 5)<br />o Sūrah As-Ṣaff (Sūrah 61)<br />• What is  المَائِدَة Al-MāꜤidah<br />• This segment is key to how you communicate with Allahh<br /><br /><br />Some of the questions we deal with in this segment are:<br />• Who are the Hawariyyoon?<br />• What is Jesus's relationship to the Hawariyyoon?<br /><br /><br />Some of the Quranic verses discussed in this segment are:<br />- Quran 18:4-18:5<br />- Quran 2:71<br />- Quran 3:52-3:58<br />- Quran 5:111-5:115<br />- Quran 61:14<br />- Quran 3:72<br />- Quran 22:40<br />- Quran 47:7<br />- Quran 57:25<br />- Quran 59:8<br /><br /><br />On this channel, we do NOT teach the (corrupted) Bible! We only teach the QurꜤān, using the Quranic methodology to extract knowledge from the Quran, exclusively!<br /><br /><br />We rely on the organic Quranic methodology, on the Abrahamic locution, and on the nested interpretation techniques to uncover the meanings and indications of the Quran verses.<br /><br />The conclusion: When the Quran Tafseer scholars decided to bring their stories form corrupted versions of the earlier scriptures, they misled the Muslims from engaging the Quran in the way that Allahh had instructed us to do.<br /><br />Why are we presenting these topics on this channel? <br />1. Our primary mission on this channel is to teach this divine 3ilm (of the organic QurꜤānic methodology + the Abrahamic locution) after it has been undocumented for 14 centuries<br />2. Please resist the urge of learning JUST for the sake of curiosity<br />3. The ultimate goal of learning this 3ilm is to teach you Shukoor (practicing proper communication with Allahh)<br />4. This channel is NOT to AFFIRM what you were taught, but to apply the methodology to seek the truth about the Quran. Learn how to empty your cup before you can receive a fresh refill!<br />5. This channel could be a witness against you, and thus, please take this 3ilm seriously<br />6. You may decide that this is not convincing. Fine! Use the QurꜤānic methodology and Insha Allahh you will be led by Allahh to a better understanding that may help all of us!<br /><br /><br />To view the first video in this series titled &quot;Why No Stories = No Quran?
