{% raw %}This video has been created to complement the resource on mental health guidance for schools that you can find on the Boingboing website. Supporting children and young people’s mental health is a research-based guide created for any member of school staff who is concerned about a child or young person’s mental health and wellbeing. There is also a supplementary Covid-19 guide in recognition that the pandemic has brought additional challenges regarding emotional wellbeing and mental health. You can find the guides here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.boingboing.org.uk/supporting-young-peoples-mental-health/">https://www.boingboing.org.uk/supporting-young-peoples-mental-health/</a>{% endraw %}
