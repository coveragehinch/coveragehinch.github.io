{% raw %}Do it yourself:  how to fix those annoying squeaks in hardwood/softwood floors.  <br /><br />Here, I'm using a &quot;Squeeeek No More/O'Berry Counter Snap Kit (3232) for Hardwood Floors with Replacement Pack,&quot; which I purchased online at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E62LHM2">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E62LHM2</a><br /><br />Note that this kit is only for hardwood/softwood floors.  There are different kits for other types of floors, including when going through carpet (without having to pull up the carpet).<br /><br />To fill the holes, I used a &quot;Minwax 110066666 No 6 Blend-Fil Wood Repair Stain Pencil, Early American,&quot; which I purchased online at:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Minwax-110066666-Blend-Fil-Repair-American/dp/B0000DI7W7">https://www.amazon.com/Minwax-110066666-Blend-Fil-Repair-American/dp/B0000DI7W7</a><br /><br />As mentioned in the video, there are several different color options on their number scale.  I used the No. 6 on the first two holes, and then the No. 5 on the remaining holes for comparison.  <br /><br />You can do this!   Thanks for watching, and good luck!{% endraw %}
