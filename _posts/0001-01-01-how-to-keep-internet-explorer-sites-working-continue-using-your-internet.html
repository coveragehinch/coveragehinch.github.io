{% raw %}Continue using your Internet Explorer dependent sites and web apps, as an individual user or at scale, using IE mode with cloud-managed Microsoft Edge site lists for Microsoft 365. <br /><br />Support for Internet Explorer will end in most versions of Windows 10 as of June 15th, 2022. Microsoft Edge includes IE mode for your IE dependent sites, so you can open them just as you would in Internet Explorer without leaving the Edge browser, and continue using these apps until at least 2029. <br /><br />Join host Jeremy Chapman as he walks you through the transition to the modern Edge browser.<br /> <br />If you're new to Microsoft Edge as a modern browser, it brings productivity as well as privacy and multiple security options built on the Chromium engine. It's designed for performance and compatibility with current web standards. And importantly, Microsoft Edge is built with a dual engine advantage for compatibility with existing IE dependent sites that you use every day. <br /><br />► QUICK LINKS:<br />00:00 - Introduction<br />01:09 - User experience options<br />03:06 - Admin experience<br />03:44 - Policy setup and create new site lists<br />04:52 - Import and publish site lists<br />05:46 - IE mode configuration<br />07:14 - Wrap up<br /><br /><br />► Link References:<br /><br />To learn more, check out <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aka.ms/CloudSiteList">https://aka.ms/CloudSiteList</a><br /><br />Use the Microsoft Edge setup guide to identify sites that require IE mode at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aka.ms/EdgeAdvisor">https://aka.ms/EdgeAdvisor</a><br /><br />► Unfamiliar with Microsoft Mechanics? <br />We are Microsoft’s official video series for IT.
