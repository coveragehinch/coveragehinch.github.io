{% raw %}Min Woo Lee heads into the weekend at the 2021 DS Automobiles Italian Open with a two shot lead after following up Thursday's 64 with a 68 on day two in Rome.<br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://et.golf/Subscribe">http://et.golf/Subscribe</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />This week, the European Tour makes its way to Marco Simone Golf and Country Club on the outskirts of Rome. Ross McGowan will be returning to the DS Automobiles Italian Open, looking to defend the title he won last year at Chervo Golf Club. The strong field also includes two-time Italian Open winner Francesco Molinari who will be looking for a record breaking third title at the event. Molinari’s 2018 Ryder Cup teammate, Tommy Fleetwood is looking for his first tour win since 2019 in Rome. Henrik Stenson will take to the course with plenty of confidence after consecutive top five finishes in the past two weeks at the Omega European Masters and the D+D REAL Czech Masters. Another one to watch is 2019 Italian Open winner, Bernd Wiesberger who finished runner-up at last week’s European Tour event. <br /><br /><br /><br />► WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.europeantour.com">http://www.europeantour.com</a><br /><br />► FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheEuropeanTour">https://www.facebook.com/TheEuropeanTour</a> <br /><br />► TWITTER <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EuropeanTour">https://twitter.com/EuropeanTour</a> <br /><br />► INSTAGRAM <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/europeantour">https://instagram.com/europeantour</a>{% endraw %}
