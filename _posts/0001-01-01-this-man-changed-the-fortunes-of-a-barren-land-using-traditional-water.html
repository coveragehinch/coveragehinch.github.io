{% raw %}The Dhun series is divided into two parts. <br />The first part of Bringing water to the barren land can be found here. <br /><br />Story of Dhun:<br /><br />This dry and dusty piece of 500-acres of land on the outskirts of Jaipur<br />once hardly had 30 trees on it. But today, the same land has over 120 species of birds, 70 species of native trees and thousands of animals. <br />This land in the Phagi district once had plenty of life in it. But a devastating flood ruined the topsoil and left the land to die and be part of the desert. <br />The fate of the land changed when Manavendra Singh Shekhawat, a hotelier from Jaipur saw the land back in 2013.<br />Instead of selling the land in parts, Manavendra aspired to do something different with the land, to create an alternative ecosystem to live in, to build a unique business model while keeping the land away from the unscientific and destructive practices. <br />And the first step for his dream project was to bring water to this dry land and using traditional water harvesting practices the land today has more than 8 waterbodies in it. <br />The water also has completely transformed the life and economy of the neighbouring villages as well. <br />With the water feeding the land and with 100s of trees and buzzing wildlife, Manavendra is now stepping on to build an alternate living space here. <br /><br />Look out for part 2, where we will show you how Manvendra along with the community converted this barren land into a lush green forest.<br /><br />You can follow Dhun's work here. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/dhun_jaipur?utm_medium=copy_link">https://instagram.com/dhun_jaipur?utm_medium=copy_link</a>{% endraw %}
