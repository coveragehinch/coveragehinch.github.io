{% raw %}What a busy year 2021 was!! In this year in review video we chat over the past 12 months, recorded in our cozy shepherds hut, highlighting the main events that we have learnt from in 2021. We also reveal some of our exciting plans for 2022 and why we are stopping the veg box business. There are also some epic montage sequences!<br /><br /><br />About Tap o' Noth Farm:<br />Hi, we're James and Rosa! Welcome to Tap o' Noth Farm, a quarter acre Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) market garden and 8 acre permaculture designed forest garden farm/homestead in Aberdeenshire, NE Scotland. We practice home scale to small farm scale agroforestry and regenerative agriculture methods to produce organic fruit and vegetables, raise dairy goats for all our raw milk needs, Shetland sheep and geese to graze our silvopasture and coppice systems and laying hens, moved around in a Chickshaw, for an abundance of eggs.<br />Our videos aren't 'how to's' - more videos to give a glimpse into our lifestyle and hopefully inspire you to bring aspects of what you see into your own life.<br /><br />Patreon: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/tapfarm">https://www.patreon.com/tapfarm</a><br />If you're looking for even more content from James and Rosa then you can become a patron of Tap Farm. It takes James between 5-10 hrs to edit our vlogs, let alone the time it takes to film and farm at the same time! Your support will aid us greatly in producing our FARMVLOGS, enabling us to take the time needed to craft a beautiful film and to help fund the licences needed for the vlog soundtrack. We will list your name at the end of each vlog episode so everyone knows how brilliant you are! We will also keep you updated on our farm work/life by posting exclusive video content that is not available on YouTube such as FARMVLOG outtakes, behind the scenes footage, hints &amp; tips and more in depth videos discussing the many permaculture systems to be found on the farm PLUS the odd photo from Rosa and James.<br /><br />Social Media links:<br />INSTAGRAM - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tapfarm/">https://www.instagram.com/tapfarm/</a><br />FACEBOOK - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/taponothfarm">https://www.facebook.com/taponothfarm</a><br />TAP CHAT FB GROUP - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/tapch...">https://www.facebook.com/groups/tapch...</a><br />WEBSITE - www.taponothfarm.com<br /><br />#permaculture #organicgardening #bestof2021{% endraw %}
