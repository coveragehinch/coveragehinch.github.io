{% raw %}Hello!<br />Two days ago at cup of the day we played a map from the Christmas Calendar Project, also known as CCP. It is a mapping project that has already been hosted for years now where a bunch of mappers are building maps in order to deliver a nice map each day. Really cool project in my opinion and often these maps are insanely creative and cool to play.<br />Sadly, this map was not necessarily one of them. Before I will state why I still have to mention that the map was quite fun to play and of course not terrible, just in comparison to other tracks of the day the map had some issues. The absolute main one were the gears in the beginning of the map. There were so many possible geardowns you could catch, even in division 1 people had a super hard time with them. And yes, gears are an important thing in proper maps :D The second issue was the flow of the map in certain sections. Mainly talking about the dirt right down hill turn into the super tight slalom which just didn't feel that nice to drive and was unnecessarily difficult if you ask me.<br />Overall the map would have needed quite a bit more work here and there but I hope the mapper learns from it in order to make his next map better =)<br /><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/granadyy">https://www.twitch.tv/granadyy</a><br />Uncut Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GranaDy">https://www.youtube.com/c/GranaDy</a><br />Main Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHDes_67fEXHzUnV6CxiDkA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHDes_67fEXHzUnV6CxiDkA</a><br />Clips Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzpaOq5_NbX5KnkIEByiggA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzpaOq5_NbX5KnkIEByiggA</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GranaDyy">https://twitter.com/GranaDyy</a><br />Discord Server: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/Q25bJnUDxb">https://discord.gg/Q25bJnUDxb</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/granadytm/">https://www.instagram.com/granadytm/</a><br />_____________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Useful links:<br />-Ranking for Cup of the Day: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/cotd_ranking">http://bit.ly/cotd_ranking</a><br />-Openplanet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://openplanet.nl/">https://openplanet.nl/</a><br />-Openplanet Dashboard Plugin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://openplanet.nl/files/103">https://openplanet.nl/files/103</a><br />-Support me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/GranaDy">https://www.paypal.me/GranaDy</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
