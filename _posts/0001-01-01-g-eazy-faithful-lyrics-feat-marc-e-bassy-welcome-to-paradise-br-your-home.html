Marc E. Bassy” Lyrics:<br /><br />[Intro: Marc E. Bassy]<br />I don't wanna be a part-time lover<br />I don't wanna make you wonder where I've been<br />I don't wanna get myself in trouble<br />Out there fuckin' 'round with these hoes again<br />I don't wanna make you feel insecure, baby<br />Wanna be yours, baby<br />Something 'bout you got me feeling more mature lately<br />Make you the only girl in the world<br /><br />[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]<br />I've done broke so many hearts, it's disgraceful<br />And I know your mama told ya I'm no angel<br />But if you walked out right now, it would be painful<br />Girl, you're so bad, you make me faithful<br /><br />[Verse 1: G-Eazy &amp; Marc E. Bassy]<br />You know, yeah<br />At the crossroads and now I got the bluеs<br />I know Page Six tagged you, but you ain't watched thе news (Graceful)<br />I know I made some mistakes that you can't just excuse<br />I know I did you no favors far as your trust issues (Angel)<br />Were concerned, the second chances got burned<br />Each time that I went back on my word, it's time to learn (Painful)<br />As the vinyl turns, Usher Raymond - 6, &quot;Let It Burn&quot;<br />And I'll just sit here waitin' until this karma returns like, yeah<br /><br />[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy &amp; G-Eazy]<br />I've done broke so many hearts (You know), it's disgraceful (It's disgraceful, uh)<br />And I know your mama told ya I'm no angel (No, yeah)<br />But if you walked out right now, it would be painful (Painful, uh)<br />Girl, you're so bad, you make me faithful (Uh)<br /><br />[Post-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy &amp; G-Eazy]<br />Faithful to you (You know, hahaha, yeah)<br />Faithful to you (If anybody can do, that'd be you)<br /><br />[Verse 2: G-Eazy]<br />You say I lost my way and you hope it gets found<br />Pick the pieces back up, turn this whole thing around<br />You told the truth, I understood when you broke it all down<br />These double standards that you dealt with, I'm noticing now<br />You get upset when I'm on the road and these hoes are around<br />But it's a job, I can't stay home and be broke in the town<br />You know the real me, yeah, the Gerald when no one's around<br />Only one person I thought of when I wrote this shit down<br />Reverse roles and we suddenly swapped<br />I'm out the picture, now it happens, some things that get cropped<br />And all that's left is pretty faces, they all Photoshopped<br />But I would trade 'em in a heartbeat, everyone would get dropped for you<br /><br />[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy &amp; G-Eazy]<br />I've done broke so many hearts (You know), it's disgraceful (It's disgraceful, uh)<br />And I know your mama told ya I'm no angel (I'm not, yeah)<br />But if you walked out right now, it would be painful (Painful, uh)<br />Girl, you're so bad (You know), you make me faithful<br /><br /><br />[Post-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]<br />Faithful to you<br />Faithful to you<br /><br />[Bridge: Marc E. Bassy]<br />And if I ever doubted you, it's 'cause my vision's clouded<br />Run away from the truth, I knew (Woah, woah, woah, woah)<br />Now I feel so surrounded ever since the day I found ya<br />Nothing is so new, we never knew<br />With you, yeah<br />Hmm, I'm gonna be faithful now, to you<br /><br />[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]<br />I've done broke so many hearts, it's disgraceful (Oh, yeah)<br />And I know your mama told ya I'm no angel (I'm no angel, yeah)<br />But if you walked out right now, it would be painful (Walked out right now, oh, yeah)<br />Girl, you're so bad (You're so bad), you make me faithful<br /><br />[Outro: Marc E. Bassy]<br />Faithful (I'm gonna be) to you (I'm gonna be)<br />Faithful to you<br />Faithful (I'm gonna be) to you (I'm gonna be)<br />Faithful to you<br /><br />👨‍💻 If you like “G-Eazy - Faithful Feat.
