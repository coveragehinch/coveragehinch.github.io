The area was overwhelmed with devastation due to the recent wildfires and now massive amounts of precipitation brought by the Pineapple Express have caused even further, widespread devastation.  <br /><br />This ongoing torrent of rain unleashed #landslides, caused major flooding, and caused rivers to forge new paths wiping out people’s properties, washing away homes, stranding and drowning livestock, and obliterating kilometers of roads, highways, and multiple bridges.. and in many places any conceivable place to rebuild them without extraordinary expense and engineering has also been washed away and is precariously subject to future landslides, erosion and flooding; amongst all the devastation throughout the interior, part of Abbotsford, BC, known as Sumas Prairie has also been catastrophically flooded, submerging massive tracts of land, homes, farms, and businesses.<br /><br />“This is not over, by a long shot.”<br /><br />Unfortunately, the response to date from the government has been inadequate; despite the best efforts of the members on the ground and those in command, there just aren’t enough resources being allocated.<br /><br />This special episode recognizes the bold and heroic efforts of a group of civilian #PrivatePilots (and @mrbentley_thedog) who have more than stepped up to provide emergency relief flights and supply runs to hundreds of people and many communities cut off by these unprecedented events.<br /><br />Huge thanks to all the Supporters on Patreon!  <br />Productions like this wouldn't be possible without your help and ongoing support.<br /><br />Check out FlightChops’ on Patreon to find out how you can be part of it:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/FlightChops/">https://www.patreon.com/join/FlightChops/</a><br /><br /><br />Sponsor &amp; Supporter Links: <br /><br />ForeFlight<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.foreflight.com/flightchops/">https://www.foreflight.com/flightchops/</a><br /><br />Bose Aviation<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bose.com/a20/">https://www.bose.com/a20/</a><br /><br />Van’s Aircraft<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.vansaircraft.com/">https://www.vansaircraft.com/</a><br /><br />CloudAhoy<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cloudahoy.com/P/flightchops/">https://www.cloudahoy.com/P/flightchops/</a><br /><br />Infinite Flight<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://infiniteflight.com/">https://infiniteflight.com/</a><br /><br />The Finer Points of Flying - Jason Miller: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adventure.learnthefinerpoints.com/">https://adventure.learnthefinerpoints.com/</a><br /><br />Spectrum Airways Flight Training:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.spectrumairways.com/">https://www.spectrumairways.com/</a><br /><br />Support FlightChops and get your merch at the new store:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://FlightChops.store/">https://FlightChops.store/</a><br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.FlightChops.com">https://www.FlightChops.com</a> for Behind the Scenes and GiveAways!<br /><br />FLIGHT CHOPS DISCLAIMER:<br />I am a &quot;weekend warrior&quot; private pilot, I fly for fun with no intentions of going commercial. I have had my PPL for over 15 years, but still consider each flight a learning experience - I generally take detailed notes after each flight to remind myself what went well or what I could do to improve.... Having GoPro cameras to record flights like this is invaluable. I find these self analysis videos very helpful in my constant quest to improve, and am happy to share. Feedback is invited; however, please keep it positive.<br /><br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.FlightChops.com/">https://www.FlightChops.com/</a> for behind-the-scenes content, epic giveaways and to search episodes by aircraft type!{% endraw %}
