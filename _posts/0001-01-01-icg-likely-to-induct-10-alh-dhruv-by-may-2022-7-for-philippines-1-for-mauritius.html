{% raw %}Till date, HAL has completed the production of 320 Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) which is huge achievement in itself. Dhruv has also completed more than over 2,80,000 flying hours which adds another feather to its hat. The Advance Light Helicopter is turning out to be a shining example of Make in India and that’s why our today’s discussion is going to be Dhruvified. Besides the indigenous orders, we will also talk about the few export orders that are under very advance stages of negotiation for these helicopters. So, let’s get started. Talking about the domestic order of Dhruv, Indian Navy has signed a contract with HAL to deliver 16 Advanced Light Helicopters (ALH) Mk III out of which 6 of them been already inducted. The Indian Coast Guard has also concluded a contract for procurement of 16 advanced light helicopters (ALH) Mk-III. Out of the 16 ALH ordered, six have already been inducted into the ICG. The remaining 10 helicopters are likely to be inducted by May 2022. On 29th September 2021, the DAC has accorded the approval for the procurement of 25 ALH Mark III helicopters for Indian Army from HAL under Buy Indian- at an approx. cost of Rs 3,850 crores. Talking about the export orders, HAL had Received interest from Philippines Coast Guard for procurement of 7 ALH and 8 Do-228 aircraft through Government of India Line of Credit. Philippines at present is evaluating the Maritime version of the ALH Dhruv developed for Indian Navy and Coast Guard. The contract is expected to worth Rs 3000 crore and if successful, it will be India’s largest ever export order for defence equipment. If the ALH Dhruv and Do-228 performs well &amp; deliver high serviceability, HAL might get the follow-on orders. Dhruv also faces competition with Airbus Panther AS565 in this deal. Both of them are priced almost same but HAL is providing better support and spare package. The Dhruv Mark-I costs around Rs 45-50 crores whereas Mark-III costs 70 crore. The Mark-III version features glass cockpit and anti-vibration dampers. The Maritime version of Dhruv has further enhancements specific to Navy requirement which adds to extra weight and cost. The Maritime version of Dhruv cost around Rs110 Crore. It includes an on-board weather radar, an electro-optical pod, a searchlight, a tracker beam, emergency flotation gear, a VHF homing device, a traffic collision avoidance device, a rescue hoist that is anchored just below the main rotors, and a slithering device for marine commandoes. Apart from Philippines, Mauritius is also looking for HAL’s aircraft.
