{% raw %}Simple is always better, and this table is as simple as it gets. The top is made from 1 inch thick select pine boards, bolstered by a skirt made of 2x4's, with doubled up 2x4's for the legs. Good wood finish is important for softer woods, so I will link a very durable finish below, as well as other products used in this build video.<br /><br /><br /><br />Now THIS is Podracing! <br /><br />Support this channel Patreon!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/amircreator">https://www.patreon.com/amircreator</a><br /><br />Follow me on Instagram @a.mere.Creator:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/a.mere.creator/">https://www.instagram.com/a.mere.creator/</a><br /><br /><br />These links lead to products used in the video.
