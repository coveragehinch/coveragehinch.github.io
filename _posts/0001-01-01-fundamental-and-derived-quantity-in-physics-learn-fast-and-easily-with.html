{% raw %}FUNDAMENTAL AND DERIVED QUANTITY IN PHYSICS: Learn fast and easily with proven tips.<br /><br /><br />Fundamental and derived quantities in physics are one of the basic knowledge every physics student should know and understand well.<br /><br /><br />Basically, fundamental and derived quantities in physics involve units and measurements of quantities. <br /><br />This knowledge is very important in the discipline of physics as it will go a long way to simplify problems in the long run for beginners in physics. <br /><br />Every physics student is expected to know these quantities as the know their basic alphabets in English language. <br /><br />In this video, I explained and showed how you can know fundamental and derived quantities with their respective units easily and fast.<br /><br /><br />After watching this video, you will be able to differentiate between fundamental and derived quantities easily and fast in Physics.<br /><br /><br />Â SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE OF OUR VIDEOS <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2tIrQcOEpiyfFOClQYU4dQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2tIrQcOEpiyfFOClQYU4dQ</a><br /><br /><br />CONNECT WITH US<br /><br /><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/101855071692541/posts/101858565025525/?substory_index=0&amp;app=fbl">https://www.facebook.com/101855071692541/posts/101858565025525/?substory_index=0&amp;app=fbl</a><br /><br /><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/eaglesclass1">https://www.twitter.com/eaglesclass1</a><br /><br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/eaglesclass">https://www.instagram.com/eaglesclass</a><br /><br /><br />#Fundamental and derived quantities<br /><br /><br />#eaglesclass{% endraw %}
