{% raw %}“We know and feel in our bones that something primal is amiss. Our extended home is being eroded. It is essential that we stop and recognize these losses...to respond with sorrow, outrage and apology at these places touched by so much loss.”<br />— Francis Weller<br /><br />So many of us know this truth voiced by Francis Weller. And yet, we have so few opportunities to express our sorrow, fear, sadness and yes, even despair about a future of life in a climate-changed world. It takes courage to touch the places inside ourselves where these truths live — those thoughts and feelings that likely keep many of us up at night, but are too often held inside us, in a space both alone, and lonely.<br /><br />To create space for these feelings, The Many has teamed up with the BTS Center to create Lament with Earth — five seasonal events which will include original music, poetry, rituals, images, scripture and videos to reflect different seasons of loss through the liturgical year. These events will be interactive, inviting you to pray and sing along. You are invited to bring your own sense of loss and sadness. We will lament together, and also share that which has been a balm to our grief, strengthening us for the work we know awaits us.<br /><br />________________________<br />Learn more about The Many:<br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.themanyarehere.com">https://www.themanyarehere.com</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/themanyarehere">https://www.patreon.com/themanyarehere</a><br />Facebook/Instagram/Twitter - @themanyarehere<br />Church Resources website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pluralguild.com">https://www.pluralguild.com</a><br /><br />Get music by The Many:<br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/2ZpUGMG">https://spoti.fi/2ZpUGMG</a><br />iTunes/Apple Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/3cR0AKC">https://apple.co/3cR0AKC</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pluralguild.com/music">https://pluralguild.com/music</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://themanyarehere.com/music">https://themanyarehere.com/music</a>{% endraw %}
