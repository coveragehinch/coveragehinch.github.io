In life, we need to make some big decisions; sometimes we've all had decisions whereby we don't really know exactly which way to go whether it's #marriage- sometimes we  don't know if it's going to be successful sometimes it's a decision of a huge business sometimes shifting from one area or city to another, etc.<br /><br />Two main things one is known as consultation and two is Istikharah. Istikhara is a type of consultation but it means to seek guidance regarding the better of two issues to seek from Allah (swt) ‘s guidance as to which of these two things is better. That's the meaning of #istikhara to ask Allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala's guidance where we are confused and we are trying to say o Allah guide us towards one of the two.<br /><br />“if we have the consciousness of Allah in us Allah will guide us regarding all our affairs to what is best for us not necessarily to what is most successful in terms of business or our social life but it will be best for us.”- Mufti Menk<br /><br />💓💓💓Ismail Musa Menk was born in Harare, Zimbabwe. He is a student of knowledge trying to disseminate the Deen in the current age.<br /><br />✆Contact of Mufti Menk<br />☞Mufti Menk Official Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/fwJR75">https://goo.gl/fwJR75</a><br />☞Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/451XNl">https://goo.gl/451XNl</a><br />☞Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/58Ijqt">https://goo.gl/58Ijqt</a><br /><br />📌 Note: This Channel is not Mufti Menk channel or in relation with him.
