{% raw %}This is not a hit piece. I just think that it can be really helpful to evaluate Joel Osteen's extremely popular teaching through the eyes of a teacher who cares an awful lot about representing the Bible properly.  We often hear of problems with teachers when someone gathers just the most offensive, problematic or otherwise inflammatory parts of their teachings and evaluates them. I am not doing that today. I'm grabbing a recent, random Joel Osteen sermon to have a &quot;typical&quot; example of his teaching. We will look at how he uses the Bible, what his general teaching style is and how a Christian can evaluate and discern what to accept and reject. <br /><br /><br />Joel’s full “Let it Go” sermon from 10/31/2021. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/kJ8bUV2eYmE">https://youtu.be/kJ8bUV2eYmE</a><br /><br />In the video I will be referencing my series, How to Find Jesus in the Old Testament, and I highly recommend you check it out. It's been the most spiritually rewarding Bible series I've ever done. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHsHyvMtfgOgSPU6zEnCvxUO">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHsHyvMtfgOgSPU6zEnCvxUO</a> <br /><br />I'm Mike Winger and my website, with all free content, is <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://BibleThinker.org">https://BibleThinker.org</a>{% endraw %}
