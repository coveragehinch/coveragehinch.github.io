{% raw %}This is a very short tune that came to me while I was working my part time job during early college years LOL Influence from a typical background music found in Korean / Japanese Dramas<br /><br />This track was made on an arranger music keyboard. Think of it like Photoshop layers 'for sounds' where you have several instrument voices performed separately and put together layered on top another.{% endraw %}
