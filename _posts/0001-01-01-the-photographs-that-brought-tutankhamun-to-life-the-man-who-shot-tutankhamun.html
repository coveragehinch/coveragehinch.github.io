{% raw %}This is the story of Harry Burton, one of the great heroes of British photography. As the official photographer for Howard Carter‚Äôs Tutankhamun excavation during the 1920s, Burton created some of the 20th Century‚Äôs most famous images and helped to make Tutankhamun an international sensation.<br /><br />The film explores key locations in Burton‚Äôs life in the UK and Egypt, and sets Burton‚Äôs famous black-and-white images of Howard Carter‚Äôs Tutankhamun excavation alongside forgotten colour photographs and cine film shot by Burton himself.<br /><br />The team, led by Margaret Mountford and contemporary photographer Harry Cory Wright, will also stage creative photographic experiments to discover the secrets of Burton‚Äôs art, re-creating the make-shift studio and dark room that Burton set up by the Pharaoh‚Äôs tomb, to reveal how he produced his iconic images.<br /><br />Burton immortalised some of the most iconic moments of the 20th century, and besides recording the progress of the archaeology, his images capture the mystery, drama and excitement of one of the great archaeological discoveries of the century.<br /><br />üì∫  It's like Netflix for history...
