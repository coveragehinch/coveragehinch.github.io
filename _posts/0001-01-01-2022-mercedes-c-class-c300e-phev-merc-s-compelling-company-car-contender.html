{% raw %}A new Mercedes-Benz C-Class is big news in the motoring world, and for the latest model it's the C300e plug-in hybrid version that stands out, particularly for company car drivers. After all the C-Class is already extremely popular with company car drivers, and with the numbers returned by the C300e, that popularity could well skyrocket. It can travel up to 62 miles on electric-only power – around double of what the previous C-Class PHEV could achieve – and with that contributing to an official CO2 output of just 14g/km, Benefit-In-Kind tax rates are impressively low.<br /><br />In this CarGurus UK review, Vicky Parrott gets to know the new C300e, and gives you the lowdown on its practicality, its quality, its technology and what it’s like to drive.<br /><br />CarGurus can help you find great deals on used cars from top-rated dealers in your area. <br />To find out more, visit <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cargurus.co.uk/">https://www.cargurus.co.uk/</a><br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Contents of this video ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />0:00 – Introduction<br />01:07 – Subscribe here<br />01:25 – Equipment levels<br />02:10 – Exterior styling<br />02:50 – Boot space<br />03:17 – Interior and technology<br />05:08 – Driving impressions<br />09:16 – Final thoughts<br />09:41 – Let us know what you think<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Follow us on social ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cargurus_uk">https://www.tiktok.com/@cargurus_uk</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CarGurusUK/">https://www.facebook.com/CarGurusUK/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CarGurusUK">https://twitter.com/CarGurusUK</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cargurus_uk/">https://www.instagram.com/cargurus_uk/</a><br />For more reviews, check out our US channel, too!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/cargurus">https://www.youtube.com/c/cargurus</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br /><br />#cargurusUK #newMercedesc300e #2022mercedes{% endraw %}
