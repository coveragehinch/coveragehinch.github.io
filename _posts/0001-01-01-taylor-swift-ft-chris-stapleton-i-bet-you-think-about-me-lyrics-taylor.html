Chris Stapleton - I Bet You Think About Me<br />3am and I’m still awake<br />I bet you’re just fine, fast asleep in your city <br />That’s better than mine<br />And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree<br />And I’ll bet your friends tell you she’s better than me<br />Huh<br /><br />Well I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles<br />Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love<br />Oh they sit around talking ‘bout the meaning of life<br />And the book that just saved ‘em that I hadn’t heard of<br /><br />But now that we’re done and it’s over<br />I bet you couldn’t believe <br />When you realized I’m harder to forget<br />Than I was to leave<br />And I bet you think about me<br /><br />You grew up in a silver spoon gated community<br />Glamorous shiny bright Beverly Hills <br />I was raised on a farm, no it wasn’t a mansion<br />Just living room dancing and kitchen table bills<br />But you know what they say<br />You can’t help who you fall for <br />And you and I fell like an early spring snow<br />But reality crept in, you said we’re too different<br />You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes<br /><br />Mr. Superior Thinking<br />Do you have all the space that you need?<br />I don’t have to be your shrink to know that<br />You’ll never be happy<br />And I bet you think about me <br /><br />I bet you think about me, yes, I bet<br />You think about me<br /><br />Oh, block it all out<br />The voices so loud saying <br />Why did you let her go<br />Does it make you feel sad <br />That the love that you’re looking for<br />Is the love that you had<br /><br />Now you’re out in the world, searching for your soul<br />Scared not to be hip, scared to get old<br />Chasing make-believe status <br />Last time you felt free was when none of that shit mattered<br />Cause you were with me<br /><br />But now that we’re done and it’s over<br />I bet it’s hard to believe<br />But it turned out I’m harder to forget <br />Than I was to leave <br />And, yeah, I bet you think about me<br /><br />I bet you think about me, yes<br />I bet you think about me  <br />I bet you think about me when you’re out <br />At your cool indie music concerts every week<br />I bet you think about me in your house<br />With your organic shoes and your million dollar couch<br />I bet you think about me when you say “oh my god<br />She’s insane, she wrote a song about me”<br />I bet you think about me <br /><br />#taylorswift #ibetyouthinkaboutmetaylorsversion #redtaylorsversion #taylorsversion #MusicCavier{% endraw %}
