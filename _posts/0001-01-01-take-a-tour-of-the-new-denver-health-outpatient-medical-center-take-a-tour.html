{% raw %}Take a Tour of the New Denver Health Outpatient Medical Center<br />Denver Health, the city’s hospital providing care for all since 1860, is proud to announce the upcoming opening of its new, state-of-the-art Outpatient Medical Center, located at 660 N. Bannock St., Denver, CO 80204 on February 1, 2021. The nearly 300,000-square-foot building has seven floors featuring more than 30 medical services – all in one centralized location. The medical center allows Denver Health to expand health care to more patients in the heart of downtown Denver with key services including Primary Care, Surgery and Medical Specialties such as Orthopedics and Cardiology Urgent Care, Pharmacy and Public Health Clinics.<br /><br />Consolidating these clinics will free up much needed space around the Denver Health campus, allowing the hospital to boost primary care services, increase the number of inpatient psychiatric beds and provide the capability to double the number of operating rooms from four to eight if needed. <br /><br />Located on Denver Health’s main campus, the medical center will meet the needs of the Denver metro area’s growing population and continue to serve our mission to provide the best, high-quality care for years to come. With the opening of the Medical Center, Denver Health is making strides to realize our vision in making Denver the healthiest city in the United States.<br /><br />In this video, come along for a virtual tour with some of the first patients and employees who took a socially-distanced tour of the building just before it opened.<br /><br />Learn more about the Outpatient Medical Center and see the schedule of move-in dates for various clinics at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.denverhealth.org/OMC">https://www.denverhealth.org/OMC</a><br /><br />#DHGrowth #OMC{% endraw %}
