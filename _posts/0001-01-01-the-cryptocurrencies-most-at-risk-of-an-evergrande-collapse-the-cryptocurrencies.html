{% raw %}The cryptocurrencies most at risk of an Evergrande collapse.<br />Cryptocurrency markets continue to be heavily affected by China implementing a ban on cryptoasset trading inside the country.<br />One Bitcoin is currently worth just over $57,500, down considerably from an early September peak of almost $71,000.<br />The other major cryptocurrency Ethereum is also trading through a small downturn, with one ether now worth less than $4000. In early September it was almost 20 per cent higher at just under $5300.<br />Simon Peters, market analyst and crypto expert at eToro, said ongoing developments in China — including the ballooning Evergrande crisis — are weighing heavily on cryptocurrency markets.<br />&quot;Early in the week, news began to emerge of the Evergrande crisis which sent contagion spiralling through all markets. Cryptoassets felt the effects as the broad-base selloff took hold on Monday,&quot; Mr Peters said.<br />&quot;Evergrande has massive debt exposure — over $300 billion — and has failed to make payments on time to its creditors.<br />&quot;The implications for wider crypto markets are not direct, but with debt fears looming, cryptoassets such as Tether could be affected.&quot;<br />Mr Peters said the cryptoassets most likely to be affected by a collapse of Evergrande were those tied to reserve assets, and not necessarily the bigger names such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.<br />&quot;Stablecoins like Tether are pegged to fiat currencies such as the US dollar. But to maintain the peg they require holdings to match the value of the cryptoasset,&quot; Mr Peters said.<br />&quot;Many can't hold large amounts of cash and instead use commercial paper – a form of short-term debt – to account for the value.<br />The issue here is that, with Evergrande creating 2008-style contagion risk for debt markets, stablecoins could run into trouble were the commercial paper they hold to lose value. Unfortunately, as such a crisis is unprecedented, it remains to be seen what will happen next.&quot;{% endraw %}
