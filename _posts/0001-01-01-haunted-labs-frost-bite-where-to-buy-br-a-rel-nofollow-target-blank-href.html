{% raw %}Where to BUY ?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/HauntedLabs">https://linktr.ee/HauntedLabs</a><br />Instagram: <br />@hauntedlabsoffical  <br /><br />**DESCRIPTION**<br />The Frost Bite dishes out its icy fury via a straightforward three-knob control format – Tone, Fuzz and Level. But beware: the grandiose, punishing sweep of its Fuzz settings exceeds anything that you’ve encountered in this life...or any past life, for that matter.<br /><br />The pedal’s unique silicon circuit is voiced to provide extended low-end impact and ultra-gnarly mid-high presence. Perfect for ensuring that your solo cuts through the frozen tundra, or dismembering unsuspecting listeners.<br /><br />Continuing the Haunted Labs tradition, the Frost Bite offers true bypass switching and is designed and built in the USA using the highest quality parts available.<br /><br /><br />**GEAR USED**<br />Gibson SG Special<br />Matamp GT120MV<br />Atlas 2x12<br />Haunted Labs | Frost Bite <br />Tuning : D Standard <br />Mics: (2) Shure SM57's <br /><br />Like and Share on Instagram <br />@fuzzed_Drones{% endraw %}
