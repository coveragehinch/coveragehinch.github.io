{% raw %}The ancient site of Boncuklu Tarla in Mardin, Turkey is re-writing history, and experts are now sure it’s older than Gobekli Tepe.<br /><br />Like many of the truly ancient sites in Turkey, this site was also buried beneath a mound and finds date from the Epipaleolithic period through to the Late pre-pottery Neolithic B.<br /><br />Incredibly, nearly 30 houses, 6 public structures as well as skeletons of 130 individuals have been found. Reports says that more than 100,000 beads as well as a temple that is older than Gobekli Tepe have also been uncovered.<br /><br />What sets this site apart from the other Tepe sites, which are generally located around the Harran plain to the west, is that it covers more phases of history – the late Epipalaeolithic, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and B, covering a real transitional phase of ancient history during and after the Younger Dryas.<br /><br />Watch this video to learn about the news coming out of Boncuklu Tarla and how it continues to re-write history with every new discovery.<br /><br />All images are taken from Google Images and the below sources for educational purposes only.<br /><br />Sources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.haberturk.com/boncuklu-tarla-da-12-bin-yillik-oldugu-tahmin-edilen-tapinak-bulundu-3229287">https://www.haberturk.com/boncuklu-tarla-da-12-bin-yillik-oldugu-tahmin-edilen-tapinak-bulundu-3229287</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/yasam/mardinde-12-bin-yillik-tapinak-gun-yuzune-cikarildi-gobeklitepeden-daha-eski-1878759">https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/yasam/mardinde-12-bin-yillik-tapinak-gun-yuzune-cikarildi-gobeklitepeden-daha-eski-1878759</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.haberturk.com/video/haber/izle/boncuklu-tarlada-12-bin-yillik-oldugu-tahmin-edilen-tapinak-bulundu/741334">https://www.haberturk.com/video/haber/izle/boncuklu-tarlada-12-bin-yillik-oldugu-tahmin-edilen-tapinak-bulundu/741334</a><br /><br />#AncientArchitects #GobekliTepe #BoncukluTarla{% endraw %}
