{% raw %}Germany is a country with a rich history, remarkable cities, and beautiful landscapes. <br />Famous for its cathedrals as much as for its fairytale castles and uninhibited nightlife, it is also the seventh most visited country in the world. <br />Despite being the largest and wealthiest nation in the EU, Germany is overall quite an affordable place to live with cheaper costs than virtually all of its neighbors to the west and north. <br />With its strong economy and job market, it’s no wonder that moving to Germany is a popular choice for expats looking for work overseas. <br /><br />If you’re planning to move to Germany then there are a few things that you should take into consideration before you choose a place to live. <br />If you’re fluent in the language, that’s a plus, but if you’re still learning then it’s a good idea to settle in an area where your native tongue is more frequently spoken. <br />In most areas, the locals are welcoming to newcomers who move to the country for work or for retirement. <br />Germans speak German. Of course, they speak other languages such as English, but to get around the country, it is best to at least have some basic language skills. <br />You might be frowned upon if you have no idea how to say hi, please, and thank you in German.<br /><br />In this video, we’ll look at the best cities to live in Germany by considering which offer the greatest balance between a high quality of life and affordable living. <br />Here are the 10 best places to live, visit, or retire in Germany:<br />1.
