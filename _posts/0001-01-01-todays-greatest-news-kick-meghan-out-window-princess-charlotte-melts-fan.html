Such is the clamor for the music.&quot;<br />William continued: &quot;One of the songs that the children are loving at the moment is Shakira, 'Waka Waka'.<br />&quot;There's a lot of hip movements going along. There's a lot of dressing up.&quot;<br /><br />#PrinceHarry #TheQueen #Queen #MeghanMarkle #Wedding #anniversary #Diana #PrinceWilliam #Kate #PrinceCharles #Archie #Phillip #PrinceLouis #Dianastatue{% endraw %}
