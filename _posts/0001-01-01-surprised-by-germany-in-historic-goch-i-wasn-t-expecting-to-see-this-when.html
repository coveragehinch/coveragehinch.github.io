{% raw %}I wasn´t expecting to see this, when I went for a walk through Goch, a town we know existed in 1259. It´s right on the border to Holland. The artist, Vincent van Goch, probably had relatives form this town. There are so many more beautiful historical buildings in Goch, but I only had time to film these. I´ll just have to come back. The people were so very friendly here, and I´ve only scratched the surface of what´s to be discovered in Goch.<br /><br />0:00 Intro to Goch<br />0:35 The Steintor<br />1:37 Das Haus zu den fünf Ringen<br />2:19 Das Rathaus<br />3:01 The Evangelical Church<br />3:24 The Catholic Church<br />4:17 Outro<br /><br /><br />❓ Is this what you thought Germany would look like? <br />Tell me what you think in the comments, I´d love to know.<br /><br />👩🏻👋🏻 I´m Celtic, (Welsh), and I feel very much at home in beautiful Germany.  <br />I feel a strong desire to share these moments of beauty with you, in the hope that it will also lift your spirits.
