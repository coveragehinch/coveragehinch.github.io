{% raw %}IQ, short for intelligence quotient, is a measure of a personâ€™s reasoning ability. In short, it is supposed to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions or make predictions. Certain tasks or jobs require certain IQ scores, some of them are too simple in order to ask for a high IQ, but some of them require the brain potential of highly intelligence people. This comparison video lists some tasks and how much of IQ does it demand.<br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This probability/comparison is based on public data, surveys, public comments &amp; discussions and approximate estimations that might be subjected to some degree of error.<br /><br />Subscribe to Infinite Comparison for more Probability Comparison/Comparison videos.<br /><br />Icons: www.flaticon.com{% endraw %}
