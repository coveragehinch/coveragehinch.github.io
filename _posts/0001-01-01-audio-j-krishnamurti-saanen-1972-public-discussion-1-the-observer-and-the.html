Krishnamurti – Saanen 1972 – Public Discussion 1 – The observer and the observed<br /><br />Q: How can I learn about myself?<br /><br />I want to learn about myself without conclusion because conclusion prevents looking at the fact.<br /><br />There is the observer and the thing observed. When there is an observer there must be division and conflict.<br /><br />I am not a harmonious whole, I am fragmented because I hate and love, I am ambitious and greedy. <br /><br />The observer is the cause of division. How is the observer not to divide himself?<br /><br />Can the mind respond totally to every challenge so that there is no conflict and therefore no observer?<br /><br />---<br /><br />This channel is managed by the Krishnamurti Foundation Trust, UK, and by the Krishnamurti Foundation of America.<br /><br />The role of the foundations was described by Krishnamurti when he said, 'The foundations will see to it that these teachings are kept whole, are not distorted, are not made corrupt. They will not give rise to any sectarian spirit in their activities... nor create any kind of place of worship around the teachings or the person. ' <br /><br />We maintain extensive archives of Krishnamurti's original works and all four Krishnamurti foundations are actively engaged in the publication of material in various forms.<br /><br />Our videos contain thousands of subtitles in more than 25 languages, translated by volunteers from all over the world. If you would like to help us with translating subtitles, please contact us at digital@kfoundation.org<br /><br />For more information about J.
