{% raw %}Inbound links are when other websites link to your website. These are the click-able text that when you click on it will bring people to your website.<br /><br />Inbound links are the gold standard in Google’s eyes when it comes to determining where websites rank online.<br /><br />Think of it like this. Every link is a vote. And the websites with the most votes rank the highest. SEO is not that simple, but it’s an easy way to think of it.<br /><br />Inbound links are not all treated the same. Some inbound links are worth more than others. <br /><br />For example, a link from the local newspaper is worth more than a free directory. Or a link from your alma mater featuring you as a success business owner is worth more than a paid advertising link.<br /><br />Inbound links always need to be in the back of your mind as a business owner. Which charities do you support could write a blog post about your business? <br /><br />What newspaper or news station did you turn down because you didn’t think their article was worth your time? <br /><br />Remember, having articles written about your business is the gold standard when is comes to ranking higher in Google.<br /><br />Inbound links cannot be paid for. So never buy links from sketchy websites online. Because Google could penalize your website and push your rankings down in Google.<br /><br />Inbound links is something all businesses need to think about because if you can get a few qualities ones, it could propel you ahead of the competition. For example, a commercial photographer was dominating the rankings in Google. <br /><br />When I did an analysis of their links, they had a very high quality link coming from a local museum blog. Because they entered and won a competition several years back.<br /><br />Remember, get people talking about your website and get more inbound links.
