{% raw %}In this video we demonstrate the removal of a championship baseball ring that was made of stainless steel or another very durable metal.  Over 75 minutes of cutting with the GEM Ring Cutter was required before it was successfully removed.  In the end we won, but the championship ring was a worthy opponent.{% endraw %}
