Who will be last to leave in this survival challenge. The giant bunker is so large we will give you the full tour, but Jeff can barely fit inside the tiny underground bunker. Although that one will be impossible to find if we were playing hide and seek. These are the best bunkers Dangie Bros have ever built! Special thanks to the Dangie Bros build team! Which bunker would you rather live in?<br /><br />FOLLOW DANGIE BROS ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIAS (@TheDangieBros):<br /><br />Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DangieBrosVideos/">https://www.facebook.com/DangieBrosVideos/</a><br /><br />Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thedangiebros/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/thedangiebros/?hl=en</a><br /><br />FOLLOW OUR PERSONAL INSTAGRAMS:<br /><br />Follow Chris on Instagram: (@christopherryan98)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/christopherryan98/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/christopherryan98/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Follow Jeff on Instagram: (@jeffufahh)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jeffufahh/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/jeffufahh/?hl=en</a>{% endraw %}
