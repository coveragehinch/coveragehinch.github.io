{% raw %}With Tim and Brad on tour in Europe collect the new team car, it is time for Tom and Marc to visit the Lotus headquarters in Hethel, Norfolk. The British manufacturer is working hard on the development of their latest model, the Emira, and we were given an in-depth look at the new member of the Lotus family.<br /><br />The day starts with Tom and Marc deciding which car to take to Lotus Cars. The reason behind the final choice might surprise you. On site at the factory, the guys are greeted by the best Lotus has to offer these days and more. Three special events are planned giving us and you a special look into the current ongoing development process of the Emira.<br /><br />First up, Marc has news to share! He is also planning to order his first Lotus, which won't be the Emira First Edition with its V6 manual which Tim opted for. Instead Marc has chosen the four-cylinder running the AMG power-plant and 8-speed gearbox.<br /><br />After an initial walkaround in the showroom, a development rig is shown which includes the virtual cockpit of the Emira. A full demo is given showing us more of how the dashboard displays and the system behind it all is going to work. <br /><br />A great little tour by the development team, which is followed by a talk with Scott Walker, commonly referred to as Mr. Lotus due to his extensive knowledge of the Lotus brand. Scott shows us around the car, tells us about all kinds of interesting in-depth details which you might not know yet!<br /><br />The final highlight of the day brings us to the race track where Senior Vehicle Dynamics Engineer, Dan is taking us for a lap around Lotus' private race track. The first track outing shows us how well-balanced the new sports car is with the highlights being the front axle set up, quick steering, immense levels of grip and more importantly the lovely soundtrack of the supercharged V6.<br /><br />The day ends with a recap of the experience at Lotus Cars. Special thanks to the team at Lotus for organising such a lovely day full of experiences making us look forward to the day we can drive the Emira ourselves.<br /><br />Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
