{% raw %}Hey hey welcome to vlogmas day 2. I’ve been hard on myself recently for falling out of my routine, not eating healthy, yada yada. In today’s vlog we talk about weight gain stress and my mindset for December to be gentler on myself and enjoy the month for what it is. I bring you along my 12,3,30 and all the Xmas vibes are present. I’ll be hanging with you in the comments as usual xo{% endraw %}
