{% raw %}Decrease Platelets<br /><br />Platelets are so tiny that they only make up a tiny fraction of total blood volume. The function of platelets is mainly to prevent bleeding by clotting the blood. However, in rare cases, some people develop a condition in which the bone marrow produces too many platelets, known as thrombocytosis.1 This can lead to the formation of large blood clots which may cause health issues like strokes or heart problems. Start with Step 1 below for more information on how you can decrease the number of platelets in your blood through diet, lifestyle and medical means.<br /><br />Through Diet and Lifestyle Eat raw garlic to decrease the number of platelets in your blood.<br /><br /> Raw or crushed garlic contains a compound called &quot;allicin&quot; which affects the bodys ability to make platelets, therefore decreasing the number of platelets in the blood.  Your body responds to the lower platelet level by improving its immunity, which helps to protect the body from any foreign objects such as viruses and bacteria that enter the system.The allicin content of garlic decreases rapidly with cooking, so try to eat it raw. Eating raw garlic causes stomach upset in some people, so be sure to eat the raw garlic with food.Take gingko biloba to reduce blood viscosity.<br /><br /> Gingko biloba contains substances called “terpenoids” which reduce blood viscosity making it thinner and prevent the formation of clots.  Gingko biloba also help to improve blood circulation and increases your bodys production of warfarin, which helps to dissolve clots.Gingko biloba is available as a supplement in liquid or capsule form. You can buy these supplements at the drug or health food store.If you can get your hands on gingko biloba leave, you can boil the leaves in water for 5 to 7 minutes, then drink the water as a tea.Use ginseng to prevent clot formation.<br /><br /> Ginseng contains “ginsenosides” that help to decrease platelet aggregation, and therefore prevent the formation of clots.
