{% raw %}Checks hold an odd place in our personal finances. In many ways, checks seem like relics from a previous era. We maybe write one or two checks a month (usually for rent or similar bill-paying situations where electronic payment simply isn’t an option). This is<br />vastly different from only a few decades ago, when checks represented more than 85% of all non-cash retail payments. (Can you imagine whipping out a checkbook in line at the grocery store? Times have certainly changed!)<br /><br />However, despite their gradual decline in use, checks haven’t become completely extinct. We still keep our money in checking accounts, we still balance our checkbooks, and new banking technologies (mobile check imaging is one example) are being<br />introduced to improve the process of paying by check. Writing checks continues to walk the line between permanence and obsolescence.<br /><br />Whether or not checks are on their way out, understanding the basics of your checking account can help you stay on top of your finances.<br /><br />SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union<br />Federally Insured By NCUA | Equal Housing Lender<br /><br />It’s a Money Thing is a registered trademark of Currency Marketing{% endraw %}
