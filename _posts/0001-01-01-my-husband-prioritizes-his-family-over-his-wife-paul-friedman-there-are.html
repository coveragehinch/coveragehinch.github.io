{% raw %}There are some cultures where it is usual for a husband to not leave his family for his wife but bring his wife into his family. In some cultures, the wife literally moves in. I'm assuming that that's not the case for you but even in those situations, even when there is a little bit of rivalry between the husband's mother and the wife. It always boils down to the same thing. Now I'm also going to tell you at this point that you should subscribe to this channel and learn a lot about marriage because that's really what's going on here. We don't learn about marriage. We don't learn about how to please our husbands. Husbands don't learn how to please their Wives and so there's a very high divorce rate in the western world, and there would be a really high one in the eastern world if it were less frowned upon. But this particular issue is one that you can do something about. You see when a husband gets married, he has a subconscious expectation which is not unrealistic, I might add, that his wife will give him something that he only can get from a woman which is unconditional love.<br /><br /><br />-------<br /><br />Join our mailing list and get our Top 10 Do's and Don'ts for Marriage:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://gotmf.org/top10">http://gotmf.org/top10</a><br /><br />Ask a TMF counselor about your situation, free:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://gotmf.org/aac">http://gotmf.org/aac</a><br /><br />12 Week Marriage System:<br />Men &amp; Women's courses: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://gotmf.org/system">http://gotmf.org/system</a><br />Watch Paul talk about the system: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/WdJ6a_6_FSU">https://youtu.be/WdJ6a_6_FSU</a><br /><br />Paul's Books:<br />Breaking The Cycle <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://gotmf.org/btc">http://gotmf.org/btc</a><br />Lessons for a Happy Marriage <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://gotmf.org/lfhm">http://gotmf.org/lfhm</a><br /><br />Follow Us:<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MarriageFdn">https://twitter.com/MarriageFdn</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinterest.com/TheMarriageFoundation">https://pinterest.com/TheMarriageFoundation</a><br /><br />All other information about TMF:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://themarriagefoundation.org">https://themarriagefoundation.org</a><br /><br />-------<br />#marriageproblems #frustratedwoman #frustrated #unhappywife #marriageissues #wifeandhusbandproblems{% endraw %}
