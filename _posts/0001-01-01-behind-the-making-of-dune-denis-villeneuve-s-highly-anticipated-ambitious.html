{% raw %}Denis Villeneuve’s highly anticipated ambitious adaptation of Frank Herbert’s Dune is finally here after years in the making and multiple delays. With a stellar A-list cast that includes the likes of Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Dave Bautista, an extremely gifted filmmaker like Villeneuve who has brought us films like Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 and  to an epic scope on the scale of franchises from the likes of Lord Of The Rings, there has been quite a lot of eyes on Dune. The story follows Paul Atriedes, the son of a noble family, who is entrusted with keeping one of the most vital elements in the galaxy safe. Dune was made on a massive budget which allowed the film’s creative team to really go the extra mile when bringing the planet Arrakis to life. From building actual detailed and layered sets that were meant to enhance the actors and actresses’ performances, filming in extremely high temperatures in the deserts of Dubai and Jordan, and shooting in the mountains of Budapest, the making of Dune is unlike many other blockbusters. Even elements that may seem minor such as the carvings of the sandworms on the wall and the sand the characters walk on, was all made carefully and with a clear vision. It wasn’t all smooth sailing making Dune, as the crew did encounter problems along the way such as lighting windowless locations or having to edit during lockdown where the main editor and the director couldn’t sit in the main room. Even with those hurdles, there is a lot of promise within Dune.<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:18 Filming Locations <br />01:27 Sinking Sand<br />01:53 Thopters<br />02:22 Fighting Styles<br />03:03 Budapest<br />03:49 Speaking In Tongues<br />04:20 Cultural Links<br />04:45 Lighting The Fortress<br />05:15 Filming With IMAX cameras<br />05:48 Stellan Skarsgard’s Bath<br />06:16 Color Scheme<br />06:48 Hans Zimmer’s Innovative Score<br />07:26 Google Earth<br />07:51 Editing Is Like Music<br />08:24 Long Way Coming<br />08:57 Outro<br /><br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/">https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/</a><br /><br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thethings.com">https://www.thethings.com</a><br /><br />Written by: Nate Richard<br />Narrated by: Zachary Goldber<br />Edited by: Joaquín Rodríguez<br /><br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
