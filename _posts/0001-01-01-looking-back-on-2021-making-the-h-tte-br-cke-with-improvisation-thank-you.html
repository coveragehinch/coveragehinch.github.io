{% raw %}Thank you for watching this year. See you next year.<br /><br />The biggest event of the year was the maintenance of the bamboo thicket, which had been neglected and in disrepair for many years. I sawed through all the countless bamboos! I'm currently planting a variety of trees and plants in this area. Next year I may also build a flower bed with stones, a walkway, and a ...new cabin.<br /><br />I bought an alto saxophone in October, so I'll have to hold out for new boots. I will do my best with the boots with holes for a while.<br /><br />This place is part of my homestead.<br />The animals (LAMP, YONA, and GWIN) stay in the main house, except when I bring them here occasionally. They don't sleep curled up together, but they don't fight and keep a good distance from each other.<br /> <br />This is not a how-to video.<br />The method I'm using is not necessarily the right one. Nowadays, you can find out the right way to do things by searching on Google. If you only want results, that's fine too.<br />But for me, the most important thing is not whether a method is right or wrong, but to experience firsthand why it succeeds or fails.<br />All work is done personally and at my own risk.<br />Please enjoy it as entertainment only.<br /><br />The products can be purchased.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/brcke">https://teespring.com/stores/brcke</a>{% endraw %}
