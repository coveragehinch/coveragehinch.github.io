{% raw %}We’ll we’ve faired it and we’ve sanded it and it’s time to apply Totalprotect 2-part epoxy barrier coat to the hull of our V-Bottom skiff.  This will act as a protection for the fiberglass and also helps continue to fair our out any last remaining imperfections in the hull.  We’re going to thin the epoxy approx 10% and apply two coats with sanding in between.  Our next step will be rip some additional lumber for the rails, in whales and few other pieces we’ll need, as well as our center runner.  That’s the piece that will run down the center of the boat and helps with directional stability and also gives you a strong platform to help spread the load when you’re jacking or moving the boat as well as protection for the fiberglass.<br /><br />TotalBoat TotalProtect:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.totalboat.com/product/totalprotect/">https://www.totalboat.com/product/totalprotect/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tipsfromashipwright.com">http://www.tipsfromashipwright.com</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/tipsfromashipwright">http://www.facebook.com/tipsfromashipwright</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/louissauzedde">http://www.twitter.com/louissauzedde</a>{% endraw %}
