{% raw %}Is it appropriate to combine current events and the Jesus story? Pastor Allen Jackson shows examples from the Bible of how God’s Truth, declared in the light of current circumstances, moves peoples’ hearts towards God. Our assignment is to be diligent workers in the body of Christ, to grow God's Kingdom, and to be salt and light within our schools, churches, cities, states, and nation. Pastor Allen also discusses communion and how to make it a meaningful part of our lives at home, at work, and within our communities.<br /><br />A message from Pastor Allen Jackson at World Outreach Church in Murfreesboro, TN.<br /><br />Follow Along!<br />Sermon outline PDF: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3x5IVbk">https://bit.ly/3x5IVbk</a><br />Sermon outline fill-in version: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/371BWpj">https://bit.ly/371BWpj</a><br /><br />Subscribe for more content from Pastor Allen Jackson: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJ_L35KPnDoIfzbe4sfRQA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJ_L35KPnDoIfzbe4sfRQA</a>  <br /><br />#pastorallenjackson #worldoutreachchurch <br /><br />Connect with Pastor Allen: <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.allenjackson.com">http://www.allenjackson.com</a><br />Pastor Allen Jackson Web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://allenjackson.com">https://allenjackson.com</a> <br />Pastor Allen Jackson Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pastorallenj...">https://www.facebook.com/pastorallenj...</a><br />Pastor Allen Jackson Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/pastorallen...">https://www.instagram.com/pastorallen...</a>{% endraw %}
