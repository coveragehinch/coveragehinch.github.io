{% raw %}This video is for everyone who was in my corner this year: from my physical and mental coaches; to the kind people who messaged with words of support and encouragement; to my friends and family who stood by me through thick and thin: to the brands who stepped up late in the year to make sure I had everything I needed to compete against the best. I experienced so much kindness and support this year from the people closest to me to complete strangers and for that I am so grateful.<br />It was an extremely challenging year, one I wouldn't repeat but sitting here now a year on in a completely different situation I hope, if nothing else, that this saga gives people hope that if they persist and stay focused on where they want to be in the face of adversity, then even 12 months on they can be in a completely different place. Thank you to everyone who played a part in getting me to where I am today, I'm excited to share my 2022 plans with you very soon!<br /><br />Find the full Keeping up with Katy series in my playlists! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WJO1FIqBx8&amp;list=PLYeUCfVQwNTIz2MIomi_OOhvd-MNuGNTl">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WJO1FIqBx8&amp;list=PLYeUCfVQwNTIz2MIomi_OOhvd-MNuGNTl</a><br /><br />Filmed by: James Lumley-Parkin and Matt West<br />Edited by: Matt West{% endraw %}
