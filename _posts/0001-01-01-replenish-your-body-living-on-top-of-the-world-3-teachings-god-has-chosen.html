{% raw %}(3 Teachings) God has chosen you for such a time as this! In this three-part teaching, Dr. Bill Winston imparts biblical truths on why you are designed to do the impossible, and how to live separate from the world. Like Abraham, you were created to depend only on God. As you operate in your authority as a born-again believer, itâ€™s your faith-filled words that carry creative power. Continue to line up your thoughts with the Word, see yourself how God sees you, and trust that God wants the best for you. Start Living on Top of the World, today!
