{% raw %}Just after 2:15 pm, a female driving a Nissan Rogue was eastbound on FM 2854 near Montgomery. As she slowed to turn onto Collier Cemetery Road she was rear-ended by an eastbound Honda. The crash put the Nissan Rouge into the westbound lanes of FM 2854 and in the path of a westbound dump truck. The impact took both Rogue and the dump truck into the ditch. The female was trapped in the Nissan. She was pronounced deceased on the scene. Montgomery County Precinct 1 Justice of the Peace Wayne Mack ordered Eickenhorst Funeral Directors to transport the victim to the Montgomery County Forensic Center for autopsy. There were no other injuries. DPS is investigating the crash. The crash occurred just 100-yards from the fatal crash on August 23, 2021.{% endraw %}
