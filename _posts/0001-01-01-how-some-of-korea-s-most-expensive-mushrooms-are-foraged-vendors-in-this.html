{% raw %}In this episode of ‘Vendors,’ we follow expert forager Yang Hee Kim, who sets out to one of only 50 locations in Korea where valuable Yangyang pine mushrooms can grow. The luxurious fungi cannot be artificially cultivated, and can only be picked for 30 days out of the year, making them extremely valuable.   <br /><br />Credits: <br />Producer: Carla Francescutti<br />Director/Producer: Nadia Cho<br />Camera: Gerald Lee, Tim Han<br />Subtitles: Vicky Won<br />Editor: Carla Francescutti <br /><br />Executive Producer: Stephen Pelletteri<br />Development Producer: McGraw Wolfman<br />Supervising Producer: Stefania Orrù<br />Audience Development Manager: Terri Ciccone <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more episodes of 'Vendors,' click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://trib.al/L7IuWAa">https://trib.al/L7IuWAa</a> <br /><br />Eater is the go-to resource for food and restaurant obsessives with hundreds of episodes and new series, featuring exclusive access to dining around the world, rich culture, immersive experiences, and authoritative experts.
