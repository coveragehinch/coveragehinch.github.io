{% raw %}More than a decade after Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, a fierce diplomatic battle continues over recognition. Indeed, an equally heated debate rages over just how many states have actually recognised it. Apart from the dispute over the number of initial recognitions, the number of states that have since withdrawn their recognitions (or 'de-recognised' Kosovo) is also contested. In this video, I look at both questions and try to provide the most accurate answer to them both before producing a final figure for the number of current recognitions. <br /><br />Hello and welcome! My name is James Ker-Lindsay. Here I take an informed look at International Relations with a focus on territorial conflicts, secession, independence movements and new countries.

While the United States and most of the European Union quickly recognised it, Russia, China and many regional powers - such as India, Brazil, South Africa - still regard it as being under Serbian sovereignty. In the years since then, Belgrade and Pristina, along with their respective international allies, have waged a fierce diplomatic battle over recognition. At first, Kosovo made significant gains. However, since 2015, the tide has turned as Serbia has persuaded a number of countries to withdraw their recognition. As a result, there is now considerable confusion over just how many countries actually recognise Kosovo. As I show, this is down to a range of factors, including the highly ambiguous positions of a number of countries. In this video, I look at the numbers or recognition and derecognitions, explain how the confusion has arisen, and try to provide a clear answer to the question of how many states now recognise Kosovo.<br /><br />RELATED VIDEOS<br />What is Recognition? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="jhjhttps://youtu.be/x3dDqV7khi8">jhjhttps://youtu.be/x3dDqV7khi8</a><br /><br />RELEVANT PLAYLISTS<br />Current Issues and Disputes <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUzSOLzcfKuNQmS9wQNIIKzYLUlBTyHnb">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUzSOLzcfKuNQmS9wQNIIKzYLUlBTyHnb</a> <br />South East Europe and the Balkans <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUzSOLzcfKuMsBdiFUgQ4aB-KBzYDWSMQ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUzSOLzcfKuMsBdiFUgQ4aB-KBzYDWSMQ</a> <br />International Relations, Independence and Secession <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUzSOLzcfKuM-e5i_FECucRWEZAQLFCSC">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUzSOLzcfKuM-e5i_FECucRWEZAQLFCSC</a> <br /><br />=======================================<br />FURTHER READING &amp;
