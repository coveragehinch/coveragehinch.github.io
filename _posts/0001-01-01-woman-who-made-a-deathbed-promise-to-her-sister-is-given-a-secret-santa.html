{% raw %}The EastIdahoNews.com team is busy this holiday season helping a local man gift $1 million to deserving people in eastern Idaho. Secret Santa is a real person who wants to remain anonymous and hopes to bless as many individuals in our community as he can.<br /><br />Juanita has a very big heart and has stepped up to the plate to care for her great-nieces and nephews.<br /><br />When their grandmother passed away about four years ago, Juanita promised to take care of the children. She now has three kids in her home doing her best to raise and care for them. <br /><br />Juanita cares deeply for their well-being and makes sure they attend school and church meetings as the kids have said they need God in their lives. <br /><br />Keeping the promise she made to her dying sister, “Auntie Juanita” truly is willing to give and sacrifice for these children.<br /><br />Secret Santa asked if we could go surprise Juanita and the kids with an early Christmas gift. Watch the video above!{% endraw %}
