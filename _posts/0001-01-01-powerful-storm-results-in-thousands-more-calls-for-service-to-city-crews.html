{% raw %}Many communities are just starting to dig out of the mess mother nature left behind from Sunday's storm.  In Sacramento alone, there were more than 3,000 calls for service to 3-1-1. That's three times the amount the city typically sees on a Sunday. As you can imagine, the Monday mop-up is happening in just about every neighborhood.{% endraw %}
