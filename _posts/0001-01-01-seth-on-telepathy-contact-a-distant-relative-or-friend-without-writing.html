{% raw %}Contact a distant relative or friend without writing a letter or using a telephone? This may sound improbable, yet it is very possible that all of us can do this on a subconscious level a good deal of the time. In fact, such telepathic messages may be received so easily and smoothly that we act on them automatically, without giving them any conscious attention at all. <br /><br />The Russians have been experimenting with telepathy as a method of communication between Earth and space vehicles. The U.S. government is experimenting in the transmission of telepathic command to volunteers aboard Polaris submarines. Telepathy could conceivably end up as a weapon in some future war. But what about telepathy (thought transference) in ordinary everyday life?<br /><br />The term “telepathy” has been used mainly to express what can best be called “thought transference,” without communication through usual methods. Clairvoyance has generally been used to express extrasensory knowledge of future events. But in my experience, the two are so closely related that many times it is difficult to distinguish between them. Nor do the particular terms themselves matter. They only serve to make an artificial distinction in what is basically one ESP function. Since the two designations are in general use, however, we will use them here. There are certain characteristics that seem to be involved with instances of both clairvoyance and telepathy. <br /><br />Before we discuss some experiments for you to try on your own, let us consider some of these characteristics. Extrasensory perceptions in general seem to occur when the conscious mind is diverted. Conscious concentration is apt to inhibit such phenomena. Telepathy seems to have an emotional basis in many instances. We appear to pick up the thoughts of those with whom we are psychologically close. Probably we cannot will ourselves to transmit or receive a telepathic communication. We can, I believe, allow ourselves to do so. It is important that you become familiar with those parts of the mind through which such communications must come.<br /><br />Alternate Universe Reality Activation  get full access to new meditations, new lectures, recordings from the reality con and the 90 day AURA meditation schedule<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://realityrevolutionlive.com/aura45338118">https://realityrevolutionlive.com/aura45338118</a><br /><br />Listen my book on audible <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Reality-Revolution-Audiobook/B087LV1R5V">https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Reality-Revolution-Audiobook/B087LV1R5V</a><br /><br />BUY MY BOOK! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Revolution-Mind-Blowing-Movement-Hack/dp/154450618X/">https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Revolution-Mind-Blowing-Movement-Hack/dp/154450618X/</a><br /><br />Welcome to the reality revolution<br /><br /> Music By Mettaverse<br />nocturne<br /><br />➤ Listen on Soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2KjGlLI">http://bit.ly/2KjGlLI</a><br /><br />➤ Follow them on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JW8BU2">http://bit.ly/2JW8BU2</a><br />➤ Join them on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2G1j7G6">http://bit.ly/2G1j7G6</a><br />➤ Subscribe to their channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyvjffON2NoUvX5q_TgvVkw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyvjffON2NoUvX5q_TgvVkw</a><br /><br />Join the prosperity revolution, all of my financial abundance videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo8M7wX4D348BfA2Auj_h0MP">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo8M7wX4D348BfA2Auj_h0MP</a><br /><br />All My Robert B Stone Videos In One Playlist - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo_4YbfCN1F3HvE6Tk61Z5wk">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo_4YbfCN1F3HvE6Tk61Z5wk</a><br /><br />All my videos about Dr. Joseph Murphy - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...</a><br /><br />All my Audiobooks - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo-ArT_9WQ-SrKaEP7VgIPb5">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo-ArT_9WQ-SrKaEP7VgIPb5</a><br /><br />All My Seth Videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo-unaj9uOnwSQ8dhkT58Vhp">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo-unaj9uOnwSQ8dhkT58Vhp</a><br /><br />For all episodes of the Reality Revolution – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.therealityrevolution.com">https://www.therealityrevolution.com</a><br /><br />Join our facebook group <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/523814491927119">https://www.facebook.com/groups/523814491927119</a><br /><br />Like us on Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Reality-Revolution-Podcast-Hosted-By-Brian-Scott-102555575116999">https://www.facebook.com/The-Reality-Revolution-Podcast-Hosted-By-Brian-Scott-102555575116999</a><br /><br />Subscribe to my Youtube channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOgX...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOgX...</a><br /><br />Contact us at media@advancedsuccessinsitute.com<br /><br />#seth #janeroberts #realitycreation #multidimensionality{% endraw %}
