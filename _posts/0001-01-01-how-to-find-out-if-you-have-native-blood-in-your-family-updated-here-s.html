{% raw %}Here's how you reveal your family's native secrets. In this video we tell a story about a colleague of Ronald's. And how he found out that everything he thought he knew about his own family was a lie. The story ends in newfound pride and a lot of drama and family quarrels. One day he was Norwegian, while the next day it turned out that he was a Sea Sami, just like Ronald â€“ an old native Norwegian and Nordic tribe.<br /><br />If you come from an assimilated culture, itâ€™s difficult to determine if you really are. Maybe this story can help you find out.<br /><br />Ronald had noticed that even though the college had a Danish family and was very tall - the Sami are short - he had facial features that resembled his own.<br /><br />At a job party, he mentioned this to his colleague. And it turned out that the colleague was not only Danish, he had family from Northern Norway - the central Sami area in Norway. But he had never heard the family talk about them being Sami - only that they were Norwegian. The colleague wondered how he could find out more? Ronald gave him this advice: The next time the colleague was at a family party, he should calmly just ask if it was possible that they had native blood in the family. Then Ronald said one of two things will happen ... Watch the video to find out what happened. Can the same thing happen in your family?<br /><br /><br />*** ABOUT YOURWAY2NORWAY *** <br /><br />YOURWAY2NORWAY is a different travel channel. We combine education with humor and entertainment.
