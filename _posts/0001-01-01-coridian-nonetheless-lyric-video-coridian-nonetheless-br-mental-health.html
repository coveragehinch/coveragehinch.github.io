{% raw %}Coridian - Nonetheless<br />Mental health was the driving factor for this song.<br />After going through some dips in my own life - I learnt a lot about coping methods and vehicles that pulled me out from my hole.<br /><br />From that, I offered myself as a soundboard for others dealing with their own problems.<br />It then inspired me to write these lyrics. I covered topics on how isolated we feel when going through depression. How many people outside of the looking glass cannot understand the reality of these chemical imbalances coursing through our system.<br /><br />You really feel like you’re alone and walking in slow motion as the world continues on its own.<br />So my attempt with Nonetheless was to highlight this experience. To acknowledge the isolation, and to help us find a common ground, we aren’t alone or different to the many many others dealing with their own demons.<br /><br />FOLLOW CORIDIAN:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://coridian.wixsite.com/coridiannz">https://coridian.wixsite.com/coridiannz</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Coridianband">https://www.facebook.com/Coridianband</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/coridian_band/">https://www.instagram.com/coridian_band/</a><br /><br />LISTEN TO CORIDIAN:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0lR9RQShdwXD9IW4V7veyR">https://open.spotify.com/artist/0lR9RQShdwXD9IW4V7veyR</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://coridian.bandcamp.com/">https://coridian.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><br />Video Created &amp; edited by: Dity Maharaj<br /><br />Nonetheless is written &amp; performed by Coridian<br />Mike Raven, Kris Raven, Nick Raven &amp; Dity Maharaj<br /><br />Recorded &amp; Produced by Zorran Mendonsa<br />Mastered by Ermin Hamidovic @ Systematic Productions{% endraw %}
