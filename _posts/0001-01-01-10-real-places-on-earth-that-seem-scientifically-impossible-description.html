Let’s get rollin!<br /><br />10 The Indian Ocean Sea Split<br />First up on today’s list we have a fabulous oddity that has actually turned into quite the tourist attraction. Ponnani Beach in India had been flooded back in the fall of 2018, devasting the locals as you probably would imagine. But when the floods receded, something interesting happened – a new small island was revealed along their beach… a sandy strip that went on for well over a half kilometer. How unlikely is that? Tourists began flocking to the attraction, frolicking out into the sea along the way – but experts have warned, at any moment this new, tiny island could be washed away with a strong storm or a high tide. Nevertheless, no definitive answer as the where the newly piled sand actually came from, though it’s been suggested that it’s probably just been deposited from a nearby location during the floods.<br /><br />9 The Boiling River<br /><br />Before we dive into the next topic today let me ask you a question – how hot do you like the water when you take a bath? Me myself I’d say I’m probably a medium hot kinda guy, but I know there are some out there that love it scorching hot, and for those folks there’s a river you may enjoy – although I highly recommend you stay out of it. The boiling river in Peru, discovered by ancient Amazonians a long, long time ago – has a wide-ranging core temperature that starts at 80 degrees Fahrenheit, going all the way to just over 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In fact, there are areas of the flowing water too hot for smaller animals, and if they accidently fall in they could be cooked<br /><br />8 The Waters at Karachay, The Radioactive Lake<br /><br />Up next on today’s list of some places on earth that seem scientifically impossible – is Russia’s Lake Karachay – or otherwise known as the most radioactive lake on the planet. At a sight that once was the Soviet Union’s nuclear weapon factory, a lake that’s essentially been pumped with radioactive material – is so volatile, that if you stand next to it for an hour – you’ll die. The Soviet Union actually used the lake to dump their nuclear waste in it. As one would expect, the lake has been a huge problem since the dumping began. On one occasion, where an explosion occurred in the factory, spread the radioactive particles within the lake out into the atmosphere, spreading over a 9000 square mile radios. Then another time, this one in 1967, the lake had actually dried up, and the radioactive dust was once again blown into the air, covering hundreds of miles.<br /> <br />7 The Stone Making Well<br /><br />Up next we have a story that’s going to be tough to believe but we’re telling you – this is absolutely true. There’s an old well in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire that has the incomprehensible ability to turn anything you put into it – into stone. Check this out. No matter what people leave here, whether it’s a bicycle, a teddy bear, or anything else in between – just give it a little bit of time to work its magic – approximately 3 to 6 months according to some researchers, but everything gets turned into that crazy stone. While some researchers have attributed the unusually high amount of minerals – another unexplainable mystery, in it of itself – old citizens of the nearby towns tell tales of witches that actually cursed these waters, resulting in this pretty remarkable event. So, with all that said, who do you believe? The scientists? Or the citizens? <br /><br />6 The Tree That Grows… From a Tree<br />5 ??<br />4 ??<br />3 ??<br />2 ??<br />1 ??<br /><br />Background Music: [No Copyright Music] Mystery - GoSoundtrack<br /><br />Ending Song: [No Copyright Music] Missing Someone (Vlog Music ) - Dj Quads : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-c-gGRYKUs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-c-gGRYKUs</a><br /><br />For Copyright Issues, Please Feel Free to E-mail me: Top5Supreme@Hotmail.com<br />_<br /><br />Thank you SOOO Much for watching this video!
