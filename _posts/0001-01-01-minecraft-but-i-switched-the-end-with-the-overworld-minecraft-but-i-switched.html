However, I made it so the end dimension was swapped with the overworld! This meant that the entire overworld was full of new custom structures and biomes, whilst the end became full of dirt and stone becoming the new overworld end dimension. Also, the nether has been swapped with the end, creating new sturctures and exciting biomes to explore. Do we manage to win and beat this Minecraft challenge? This Minecraft challenge was really funny and hilarious!<br /><br />Thanks to @Wisp for the video and thumbnail inspiration, despite being a loser he has some cool ideas.<br /><br />Also hi @JackManifoldTV :)<br /><br />If this video gets 15,000 likes, I'll CHOGPAMP!<br /><br />Edited by SethBoyerD<br /><br />Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or Surviving 100 Days In Minecraft, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin<br /><br />#Minecraft #MinecraftChallenge #MinecraftBut{% endraw %}
