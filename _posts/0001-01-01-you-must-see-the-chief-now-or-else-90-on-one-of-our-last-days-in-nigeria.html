{% raw %}On one of our last days in Nigeria, I had decided it would be nice to get out on a boat in the Lagos Lagoon and try going somewhere off the beaten path.  There's a place called Snake Island that's rarely visited by the residents of Lagos, and you can tell once you arrive.  Despite being part of the city, it's like stepping into the countryside, with the island being dotted by little villages.  Unfortunately, they also had a chief, who would need a special arrangement before we could go any further..<br /><br /><br />#sabbatical #nigeria #africa{% endraw %}
