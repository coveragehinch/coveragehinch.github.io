{% raw %}This gun restoration video, I restore an ak M. I bought this gun in an arsenal in the czech republic, I already intended to restore the gun, the restoration process was not easy, because akm has pins inserted at 12 tons, this means that a large hydraulic press is needed for the restoration of this gun. However, I managed to complete the restoration and make this Soviet beauty work perfectly.<br />This gun is built in Izhmash in 1971, normally he required maintenece, but this need really a restoration because he stay a lot of time in humid place. and was used for take every pieces. but at the end the restoration was end with a great result.<br /><br />MY PATREON PAGE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/restaurato">https://www.patreon.com/restaurato</a><br /><br /><br />THE MY FAMOUS RUST REMOVER:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gQqMIH">https://amzn.to/3gQqMIH</a><br /><br /><br />Skrewdriver for guns:     <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3wWyCGW">https://amzn.to/3wWyCGW</a><br /><br />The famous bluing kit:    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3g78ZfT">https://amzn.to/3g78ZfT</a><br /><br />Punch set for pins :   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3xO3PwL">https://amzn.to/3xO3PwL</a><br /><br />My camera:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34M06mE">https://amzn.to/34M06mE</a><br /><br />My instagram page:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2OStShK">https://bit.ly/2OStShK</a><br /><br />Music by SilverSoundstudio's (soviet merch){% endraw %}
