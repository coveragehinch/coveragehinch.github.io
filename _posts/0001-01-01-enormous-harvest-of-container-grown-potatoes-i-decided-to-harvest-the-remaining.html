{% raw %}I decided to harvest the remaining 7 containers of potatoes this evening.<br />These are the Sarpo Miras grown in smaller 30 litre pots.<br />The result was the biggest crop I've ever had of about 75 pounds from the 7 pots with some of the potatoes being enormous.<br />The first one being almost 13.5 pounds from just a single pot.<br />So I will continue to grow my spuds this way and grow more of this variety.<br />Facebook Page at : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Allotment-Diarycouk/119640048156011">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Allotment-Diarycouk/119640048156011</a>{% endraw %}
