{% raw %}High quality long form video from 2021 Uganda safari through Worldwide Trophy Adventures. 6 buffalo and 4 plainsgame animals are hunted. Real hunting and no sugar coating. And... for those of you inexperienced critics out there, all of these buff would have been done with one shot, but the terrain is open, and if you know anything, you keep shooting buffalo until they are down, so save the armchair critiques.{% endraw %}
