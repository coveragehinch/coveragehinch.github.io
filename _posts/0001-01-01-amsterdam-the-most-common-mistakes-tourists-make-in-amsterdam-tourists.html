{% raw %}Tourists make mistakes, we eat at the tourist restaurants, we wait too long to buy our flight tickets, we mess up sometimes. Here we talk about typical mistakes that tourists make when they visit Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Whether it is looking past staying outside of Amsterdam for accomodation or trying to find the I Amsterdam sign there are a number of mistakes tourists should be aware of when they visit the Dutch capital.
