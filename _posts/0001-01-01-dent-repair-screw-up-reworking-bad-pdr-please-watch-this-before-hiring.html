{% raw %}Please watch this before hiring a cheap dent guy. <br /><br />I’m seeing this all too often lately. Car owners opt to use the cheaper service, only to be disappointed with shoddy work and unnecessary hole drilling. Many times, it’s too severe and requires repaint by a body shop.<br /><br />This small defect was indeed minor and not as severe as many. But it mattered enough to my client, as it would matter to anyone who just wants it done right the first time.<br /><br />This video was created in the spirit of education and transparency. At the end of the day, the choice is yours, who you choose to hire. And we hope this helps you in your decision making. Thank you for watching.<br /><br />There is a better way.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://dentevo.com">http://dentevo.com</a><br />Exceptional Mobile Paintless Dent Removal Service for People with High Standards.<br />Claremont, CA <br />(626) 249-3368<br />(909) 921-1653<br /><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dentevo/">https://www.instagram.com/dentevo/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ClaremontDentRemoval.com">http://www.ClaremontDentRemoval.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.PasadenaDentRemoval.com">http://www.PasadenaDentRemoval.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.NewCarDentRemoval.com.">http://www.NewCarDentRemoval.com.</a><br /><br />FB: Facebook.com/dentevo<br /><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dentevo/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/dentevo/?hl=en</a> <br /><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://linkedin.com/in/joseph-garcia-a25416ab">http://linkedin.com/in/joseph-garcia-a25416ab</a>{% endraw %}
