{% raw %}Me and Justin took a trip to Arkansas to work with Blake and Kevin. They had a cleanup that we were going to help them on, but when we got there we realized the neighbor could use some help also. Blake called the homeowner and she was very thankful and appreciative. Since we had two overgrown properties to cleanup we decided to have a little fun with it and turn it into a competition. Even though we called it a competition it was just for fun. Kevin and Blake are two of the nicest and giving people I've ever met.
