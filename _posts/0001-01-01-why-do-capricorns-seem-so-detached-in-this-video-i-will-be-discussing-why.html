{% raw %}In this video I will be discussing Why Capricorns Seem So Detached? Enjoy❤️!<br /><br />Thank you for watching.<br /><br />**** Please don’t take anything presented in this video personal. The video was made for entertainment/educational purposes only, not to personally attack you! This a generalized video based on Capricorn Sun Sign; I am aware that there are many factors that play a role in individual personalities (which I have not gone deep into YET). This is just a summary.****<br /><br />Twitter: HeartCapricorn<br />Instagram: HeartCapricorn{% endraw %}
