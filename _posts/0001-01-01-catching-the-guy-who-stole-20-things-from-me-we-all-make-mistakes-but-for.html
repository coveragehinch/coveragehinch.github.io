{% raw %}We all make mistakes, but for your own sake. Please stop stealing from me. I will catch you every time and you will personally help load my stuff back up. As for this case we’ve resolved the matter and I’d appreciate if everyone respects them as we all make mistakes. And dude… please take your wife out to dinner. She deserves it.{% endraw %}
