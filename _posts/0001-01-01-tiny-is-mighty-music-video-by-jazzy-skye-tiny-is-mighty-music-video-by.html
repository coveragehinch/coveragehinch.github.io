My name is Jazzy Skye!  I’m part of the Fun Squad on Kids Fun TV, but I also have my own channel here!  On my channel I get to do things I’m excited about like ninja warrior competitions, gymnastics, crafts, playing with cool toys, making music, playing games, jokes, and fun skits.  I’m excited to do silly and funny videos for kids, but especially for girls! I have a twin brother named Jack!  Kade, Kalia, and Kyler are my other siblings in my family.  My favorite channels are Kids Fun TV, Payton Delu and Ninja Kidz TV.  My parents help me and monitor my channel.  Please be sure to subscribe and turn on notifications so you never miss a video!  Welcome to my channel!  Jazzy<br /><br />Kids Fun TV:<br />Kids Fun TV, also known as the Fun Squad, is a fun family friendly channel created by the Skye family. Whether it’s games or fun action skits, the kids and their parents love to have fun and play. We have lots of boys vs girls competition videos as well as twin vs twin games. We love box forts, toys and playing fun and exciting games. Whether it’s playing jokes on their dad with a toy, having an amazing birthday party, singing cover songs, creating movie remakes or having a fun superhero adventure, these funny kids love to have fun and play. Sneaky as a spy and skilled as a ninja, the Fun Squad members team up and work together to solve a mystery in each skit adventure. The children (Jack Skye, Jazzy Skye, Kade Skye, Kalia Skye and Kyler Skye) love to have lots of family fun (with Mom and Dad also) in their skits and games. <br />The Kids Fun TV channel loves making fun videos for kids and fun videos for ages 13 and older. <br />This footage is the property of Kids Fun TV and is not allowed to be repurposed without written consent from Kids Fun TV. <br />Business &amp; Other Inquiries, please email:  Admin@TheFunSquad.com{% endraw %}
