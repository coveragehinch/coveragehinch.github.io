In building a remote house, FMD Architects has taken great care to deliver architecture and interior design that welcomes congregation and connection, despite the home’s secluded location. <br /><br />Designing a remote house to celebrate the land’s history involves a nod to the faded red iron shacks dotted across the island. Coopworth juts from the soil in garnet corrugated cladding – an innovative reimagining of the traditional Australian farmhouse. Reverence to the home’s setting is felt when observing the panorama of green pastures afforded by vast bay windows, boldly framing the vista while acting as passive heat and light sources. Building a remote house presented a unique opportunity to FMD to embrace the use of a local, sustainably sourced material – resident sheep’s wool, cleverly used as insulation. Fluffy fleece peeps through clear corrugated polycarbonate over the dining area to remind houseguests of the intimate connection to arable land and agriculture.<br /><br />Further emphasising connection is the deft insertion of beds tucked cosily in private nooks and bordering the home’s expansive windows. Inviting familial bonding for the client’s extended family was FMD’s focus when building a remote house. The home feels humble at first glance, yet roomily sleeps 20 – the experience reminiscent of the classic “sleep out”.<br /><br />Orientated ideally to display a breathtaking vantage at every turn, a house tour reveals the sparkling bay and mountain ranges that envelop Coopworth in its rugged, natural setting. <br /><br />For more from The Local Project: <br /><br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/">https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/</a> <br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/</a> <br />Print Publication – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/</a> <br /><br />To subscribe to The Local Project's Tri-Annual Print Publication see here – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/</a> <br /><br />00:00 - An Introduction to Coopworth by FMD Architects <br />00:56 - Placing the House on the Land <br />01:20 - The Importance of Natural Light<br />01:38 - The Upper Level of the House<br />01:54 - The Main Living Space<br />02:21 - The View and Windows of the House <br />02:40 - Materials of the House <br />03:40 - Choosing the Colour of the House<br />04:26 - Easy Maintenance of the House<br />04:50 - What the Architect is Most Proud of<br />05:18 - Squarespace<br /><br />Architecture and Interior Design by FMD Architects.<br />Photography by Adam Gibson.<br />Build by In2Construction.<br />Production by The Local Project.<br /><br />Musicbed SyncID: MB01B3QRI8H8GV7<br /><br />#BuildingaRemoteHouse #Architecture #House #InteriorDesign #Tasmania #BrunyIsland #Home #HouseTour #RemoteHouse{% endraw %}
