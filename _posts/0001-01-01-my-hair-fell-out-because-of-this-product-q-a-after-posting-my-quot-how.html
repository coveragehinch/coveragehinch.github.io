{% raw %}After posting my &quot;how all my hair fell out&quot; storytime video a week ago I have gotten such a response I realized how much information I accidentally left out. Hopefully in this video I can further explain and answer all your questions.<br /><br />How All My Hair Fell Out Because of One Product - Q &amp; A<br /><br />The main question (of course) was &quot;What product did you use to make your hair fall out?&quot; What I used was an at home hair relaxer and conditioner cream that was advertised to relax curly hair which I wanted so I could stop damaging my hair by blowdrying and straightening my bleached hair everyday. The warnings on the directions did say &quot;Use caution when using on damaged hair due to possible hair loss&quot;, I was unaware that when you bleach your hair, dye your hair, tone your hair, color your hair, (etc) all of that damages your hair beyond repair. In turn when I used a product I believed would fix my dry damaged hair in minutes, it actually caused all my hair to burn up and get so fragile that is broke apart and fell out as I washed the product out of my hair. I am sure my hair will all grow back even though it was a pretty good chemical burn. It was a mistake and a huge hair fail on my part.<br /><br />After reading many negative comments asking me what reason do I have to cry about this situation when there are worse things going on in the world. I know this, I dont think my hair falling out due to a mistake can compare. I simply shared a story that happened to me. If you went through a hard time and want to make a video about it then I fully support you.<br /><br />Questions about me deleting my instagram pictures - I archived them so I was able to put them back up. After my hair fell out and I had to get my whole head shaved I woke up from a restless night and was so ashamed and depressed that looking at pictures of me with gorgeously long platinum blonde hair made everything worse. So I took everything down and was unsure if I would ever feel good enough to post or even live stream ever again.<br /><br />Will you bleach your hair again? Not planning on it! I am using many oils and nourishing treatments on what was left of my hair currently and am only focusing on growth and keeping my hair as naturally healthy as I can. I would like to give a HUGE thank you to everyone that commented/messaged/emailed me giving me tips and advice on how to grow my hair fast. I appreciate it so much.<br /><br />Was my social medias tied to my hair? In  a round about way, yes. I am able to live the life I have by daily live broadcasting and the base of my broadcasts are to uplift people and I was feeling so down about myself that I felt there was no way I could put on an act and pretend everything was okay.<br /><br />How do you feel about all the attention? It is so hard to believe so many people found my video. The only reason I posted it was to give an explanation to my friends/family and those that watch my broadcasts. I am overwhelmed with love and happiness with the support I received from my last video.<br /><br />Thank you so much for watching, make sure to SUBSCRIBE to keep up to date with me!<br /><br />Much love<br /><br />‚û°Ô∏èGET MY MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://hannahforcier.merchlabs.com">http://hannahforcier.merchlabs.com</a> <br /><br />Follow Hannah Forcier:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/Hannahforcier/">https://www.instagram.com/Hannahforcier/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HannahForcier">https://twitter.com/HannahForcier</a><br />¬†¬†<br />Watch More Hannah Forcier:<br />Latest Uploads:¬†<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Fg2yDk">http://bit.ly/2Fg2yDk</a><br />WIG REVIEWS | Hannah Forcier:¬†<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2DCEBto">http://bit.ly/2DCEBto</a><br />Makeup &amp; Beauty | Hannah Forcier:¬†<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2EaztJU">http://bit.ly/2EaztJU</a><br />Story Times | Hannah Forcier:¬†<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Fh9ShI">http://bit.ly/2Fh9ShI</a><br />Popular Videos:¬†<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2GhnbAr">http://bit.ly/2GhnbAr</a><br /><br />üìßBusiness Inquiries: contact@hannahforciermedia.com<br /><br />About Hannah Forcier:<br /><br />Most relatable yet unrelatable lifestyle youtuber you'll ever watch.
