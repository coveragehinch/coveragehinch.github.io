{% raw %}Holidays and weekends are a good time to find pirate radio stations on the air on the shortwave radio bands. Common frequencies are between 6.7 Mhz and 7 Mhz but they can show up just about any where in the spectrum. This weekend I was able to hear 2 stations.  They were WHYP and Liquid Radio.{% endraw %}
