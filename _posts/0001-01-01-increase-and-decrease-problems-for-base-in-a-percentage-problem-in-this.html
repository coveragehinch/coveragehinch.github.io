{% raw %}In this video we discuss how to determine the amount of increase or decrease for base in a percentage problem when using base, rate and part.<br /><br /><br />Transcript/notes<br />Let’s say that a particular house is worth $215,000, which is 10% more than last year’s value.  What was the value of the home last year?<br /><br />If we look at this visually, this was last year’s home value, which was unknown (show in graph with money amounts on left side).  And this is this year’s home value of $215,000.  We know that there is a 10% increase in value, which we can mark here.<br /><br />If we set this (graph) to 100%, then this (graph) would be 100% plus 10%, or 110%.<br /><br />Now, a quick review from previous videos.  <br />There are 3 components of a percent problem, the base, which is the whole or the total number of parts, the rate, which is a percent, a number followed by the percent sign, and the part, which is part of the base, a part of the total number of parts.  <br /><br />The formula is rate equals part over base.  <br />In our example, the value of the home increased over the time period, so, this is an increase problem.  The formula for an increase problem is the original plus the increase equals the new value.  And the original value is the base and the new value is the part.<br /><br />If the home had decreased in value then the formula would be the original minus the decrease equals the new value, with the original value being the base and the new value being the part.<br /><br />Now back to our example, where we know the rate, it is 110%.  And, we know that $215,000 is the part, because it is the new value.  So, we need to solve for the base in our percent formula.<br /><br />We can modify the formula as I have done on the screen to solve for the base.  So, we have base equals part divided by rate, $215,000 divided by 110%.  We need to convert the percent to a decimal by dropping the percent sign and moving the decimal point 2 places to the left to get 1.1.  Now, using a calculator we have 215,000 divided by 1.1, which gives us a final answer of $195,454.55 rounded off.<br /><br />So, we can say that $215,000 is 110% of $195,454.55.<br /><br />Now, let’s look at a decrease problem.  At a certain company, sales this year were $586,000, which is 20% less than last year.  What were last year’s sales?<br /><br />Again, if we look at this visually, this was last year’s sales, which was unknown (show in graph with money amounts on left side).  And this is this year’s sales of $586,000.  We know that there is a 20% decrease in sales, which we can mark here as last years sales were 20% greater than this years sales. If we set this (graph) to 100%, then this (graph) would be 100% minus 20%, or 80%.<br /><br />The formula for a decrease is original minus the decrease equals the new value, with the original being the base and the new value being the part.  So, the new value or in this case sales, of $586,000 is the part.  And from our little graph, we know the rate is 80%.<br /><br />Now we can solve for the base, or in this case, last years sales.  Base equals part divided by rate, so, we have $586,000 divided by 80%.  We need to convert the percent to a decimal by dropping the percent sign and moving the decimal point 2 places to the left to get .8.  Now, using a calculator we have 586,000 divided by .8, which gives us a final answer of $732,500.<br /><br />So, we can say that $586,000 is 80% of $732,500.<br /><br />Timestamps<br />0:00 Set up for percent increase problems using base, rate and part<br />0:30 The 3 components for a percent problem (base, rate and part)<br />0:55 Formula for a percent increase problem using base, rate and part<br />2:09 Percent decrease problem using base, rate and part{% endraw %}
