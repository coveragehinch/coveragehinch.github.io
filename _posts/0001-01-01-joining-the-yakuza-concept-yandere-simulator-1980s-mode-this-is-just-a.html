{% raw %}This is just a concept. It's not in the real game. I remember Yandere Dev once mentioning in a video (Yandere Dev's &quot;Yakuza in Yandere Simulator&quot; video) that if the player's most frequently used elimination methods was the Yakuza, then it will lead to a very interesting ending. If Yandere Dev ever gives us the option to join the Yakuza's group, it will be even better than what you see in this video. This is just something I did for fun. And I included a k!11!ng spree at the end with a p!5t0l just for fun. Yakuza's real rival k!dn_pp!ng scene in the game is way better the ones in my video. Again these are just stuff I did for fun. <br /><br />This is not a shipping video.<br /><br />I didn't bundle and use Ryoba's town dress because I don't know if the person who made it feels uncomfortable if I use it for this concept video. So I just changed and used a dress from VRoid Studio. It doesn't look as good as Ryoba's original town dress though. I hope it's ok to use Ryoba's hair for this mod since I didn't bundle it. If there are any problems please let me know.<br /><br /><br />Yandere Dev's &quot;Yakuza in Yandere Simulator&quot; video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xWSyREauXo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xWSyREauXo</a><br /><br /><br />Follow me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/yandereakirashimizu/">https://www.instagram.com/yandereakirashimizu/</a><br /><br /><br />Yandere Simulator belongs to Yandere Dev (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/YandereDev)">https://www.youtube.com/c/YandereDev)</a><br /><br /><br />I used pose mod when making this mod.

That texture belongs to it's respective owner.<br /><br /><br />The rivals' casual clothes were stuff that were already there in the game files. The only thing I did was retexture some of them.<br /><br /><br />Some models which I bundled, for example, Yakuza's model, the street model, city model etc. all belong to their respective owners. I don't who who made the Yakuza's model. They were taken straight from the game files and bundled. I did not edit them. Journalist Model was made by BD skedaddle and journalist face was made by NoicePotato. The only thing I did was bundling them. I did not edit them.<br /><br /><br />3d models used in this mod:<br /><br />Van by StepanProkop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/car/standard/preview-model-free">https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/car/standard/preview-model-free</a><br /><br />Vintage Furniture Coffee Table PBR Game Ready 3D model by MovART: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/vintage-furniture-coffee-table-3d-model-1585204#">https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/vintage-furniture-coffee-table-3d-model-1585204#</a><br /><br />Old Leather Sofa 3D model by VisjaFilipRumin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/old-leather-sofa-3d-model-1534247">https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/old-leather-sofa-3d-model-1534247</a><br /><br />Old Desk 3D by nestofgames: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/desk-old-3d-1515224">https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/desk-old-3d-1515224</a><br /><br />Old Chair Low-poly PBR Free 3D model by HuNtEr_3DdD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/old-chair-lowpoly-pbr-free-3d-model-1822358">https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/old-chair-lowpoly-pbr-free-3d-model-1822358</a><br /><br />tel√©fono CTNE 3D model by Irerodri: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/tel%C3%A9fono-ctne-3d-model-1722215">https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/tel%C3%A9fono-ctne-3d-model-1722215</a><br /><br />Door 3D Model by karwanit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://free3d.com/3d-model/door-2745.html">https://free3d.com/3d-model/door-2745.html</a><br /><br />45 ACP Smith And Wesson by 3dhaupt: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://free3d.com/3d-model/45-acp-smith-and-wesson-13999.html">https://free3d.com/3d-model/45-acp-smith-and-wesson-13999.html</a><br /><br />Gazebo by R0STlSLAV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/gazebo-wood-3d-max/863050">https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/gazebo-wood-3d-max/863050</a> <br /><br />Classic Water Fountain by Marc Mons: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-model-water-fountain-1387533#">https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-model-water-fountain-1387533#</a><br /><br /><br />Sounds used in this video:<br /><br />Door Opening/Closing - Royalty Free SFX by Glasses^2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh9RHc0uqDs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh9RHc0uqDs</a><br /><br />Top 10 P!5t0l Gun Shot Sound Effects [Super HQ]: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8rO9xay4hs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8rO9xay4hs</a><br /><br /><br />Vehicle sounds by:<br />Sound Effects: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRbUa0Fk2i4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRbUa0Fk2i4</a> <br /><br />No Copyright stuff: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci8x2mV3X_k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci8x2mV3X_k</a> <br /><br />CMB sound effects SFX: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNrvm4jyDs0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNrvm4jyDs0</a> <br /><br />CMB sound effects SFX: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrJ50-MzJLA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrJ50-MzJLA</a> <br /><br />MUSIC DRAMA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT3Fwkq9NWY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT3Fwkq9NWY</a> <br /><br /><br />Music used in this video:<br /><br />Schoolday 4 by Jayden Washi<br /><br />Yakuza Menu Music by ???
