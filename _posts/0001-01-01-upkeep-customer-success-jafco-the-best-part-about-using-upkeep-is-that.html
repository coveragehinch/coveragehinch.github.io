{% raw %}The best part about using UpKeep is that I now have a productive team that has high morale and a facility that I'm proud of every single day - that I know we're doing the best that we can, with the resources that we have, to keep all of our systems up and running. It doesn't get much better than that.<br /><br />My name is Michael Moran, and I'm the Facilities Director at JAFCO. And JAFCO is a nonprofit organization that takes care of children with disabilities, and foster children. My job is to take care of the guests that come in to the event space, and to make sure that everything, every day keeps working. And as you know, in the world of facilities, almost never happens. <br /><br />One of the things that a centralized communication system like UpKeep does is it takes the emotion out of this as a process. A work order comes in, it comes straight to me, I immediately take a look at it on my phone, and I can approve it or not. So I'm getting things fixed in two, three hours, whereas before it took two or three days.<br /><br />And it was also a significant impact on the cost. Because now I'm working with vendors that understand specific, direct, what my needs are, and it saves them time and money too. They can come and do a quick repair, and, you know, be in and out and they're making money and they're making better use of their time as well.<br /><br />And I showed them the analytics that they completed 371 work orders in a 30 day period, and their turnaround time on it is less than eight hours. You know we're walking on water using the system.**{% endraw %}
