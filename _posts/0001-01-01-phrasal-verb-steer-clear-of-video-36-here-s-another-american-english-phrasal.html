Let’s begin.<br /><br />“steer clear of”<br /><br />The phrasal verb “steer clear of” is used when we want to stay out of the way of a problem or any sort of negative situation; like maybe a mean, nasty person. We could say “You’d better STEER CLEAR OF anyone in that family.” Rumor has it, that they have a lot of connections with organized crime.<br /><br />Here are a few examples of how to use “STEER CLEAR OF” in sentences:<br /><br />If you have any sense at all, “you’ll STEER CLEAR OF my neighbor” when he’s on one of his drinking binges.<br /><br />“You should STEER CLEAR OF that airline company.” The only reason their tickets are so cheap is because they have the worst safety record.<br /><br />You’re lucky to be alive! “I told you to STEER CLEAR OF that part of town after dark.” I really don’t know what’s going on in your head sometimes. <br /><br />If you don’t want to lose all your money, “you’d better STEER CLEAR OF these Internet get-rich-quick promises.” What sounds like a great way for you to get rich, is really just a scam for someone else to get rich by taking your money. Don’t be a dummy.<br /><br />“I’m going to STEER CLEAR OF those mountains during the winter.” I’ve heard too many stories about people who went in them and never came out.<br /><br />“I suggest you STEER CLEAR OF that used car salesman.” He’s cheated more people out of their money than you can imagine. <br /><br />“Son, you’d better STEER CLEAR OF that woman.” She’s nothing but trouble. You could fill a baseball stadium with all her broken-hearted ex-boyfriends.<br /><br />In our next lesson, we’ll cover another American English phrasal verb.<br /><br />Goodbye for now.{% endraw %}
