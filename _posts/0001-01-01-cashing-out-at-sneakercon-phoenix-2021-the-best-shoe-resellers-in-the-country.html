We got to stay on home turf to come cash out and buy shoes at the sixth sneaker event, Sneaker Con, all year. Our main buys in this video are the Off White Nike Dunk Low &quot;Lots&quot;,  Nike Dunk Low Panda or Black / White, Jordan1 Mocha, Jordan 1 Shadow 2.0, Nike Dunk Low Coast, Nike Dunk Low Orange Pearl, Bred 4's and more. Sellers and vendors at SneakerCon were charging high prices, AKA &quot;Taxing.&quot; However, we were able to cash out or buy a few high end and expensive sneakers for STEALS, and we show you / give you sneaker reselling advice on how. We were amazed at how big of a showout there was at Sneaker Con PHX, and got to introduce our local resellers. Watch the full video to find out what we bought at SneakerCon and the prices we paid. We also gave tons of resell advice and tips in this video. We will be in New York Got Sole Sneaker Event next week then at SneakerCon Phoenix the next week. The sneakers and clothing we pick up are our best selling sneakers in our sneaker store. You may find our videos similar to that of Cam's Kicks and Sneak City. We hope you all enjoy the videos and thank you for the continued support!<br /><br />If you guys are in the Phoenix, Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Tempe or Scottsdale area in Arizona, come check out our shop located in Tempe!<br /><br />Help me hit 20K followers on Instagram<br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thecommonhype/">https://www.instagram.com/thecommonhype/</a><br />Store IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/commonhypeaz/">https://www.instagram.com/commonhypeaz/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/thecommonhype">https://twitter.com/thecommonhype</a><br />Cook Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thegoodchefs/">https://www.instagram.com/thegoodchefs/</a><br /><br />Music By: Valious and Depo on the Beat{% endraw %}
