{% raw %}It's hard to beat running as a family hobby: It's easy to learn, requires little equipment, can be done almost anywhere at any time, and helps everyone get some of that all-important daily physical activity. Plus, fun run events are motivating, plentiful, and yes, fun! <br /><br /><br />Benefits of Kids Running<br />When kids run, especially as part of a special program or a consistent family routine, they create a regular exercise habit. That's something that will benefit them both mentally and physically for life.1﻿﻿<br /><br />They also learn the power of perseverance and practice—that they can stick with and succeed at something, even when it's hard.<br /><br />Running is also a good option for kids who don't care for or struggle with traditional team sports, like soccer, football, or baseball. Success is individual, yet running can still be a social activity, especially if the child joins a track team. So kids can work on both their confidence and their social skills at the same time.{% endraw %}
