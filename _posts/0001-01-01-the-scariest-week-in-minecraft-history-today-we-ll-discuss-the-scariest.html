{% raw %}Today we'll discuss The Scariest Week in Minecraft's History and how the log4j vulnerability (log4shell) was weaponized on 2b2t and other Minecraft servers, as well as the entire internet.<br />This java hack is not going away anytime soon.<br />My Twitter: FitMC<br />My Instagram: fitmcsippycup<br /><br />HOW TO STAY SAFE:<br />1. Update Java to the most recent version<br />2. Update Minecraft to the most recent version<br />3. Re-install 3rd party versions of Minecraft ONLY if you know they are safe.<br />4. Servers can still be affected, so only join servers you can trust.<br />More info: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-message--security-vulnerability-java-edition">https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-message--security-vulnerability-java-edition</a><br /><br />Music: FFXV<br /><br />Additional 2b2t Footage/Information/Renders:<br />Rebane (Footage/Information) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbtg1bL1BBk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbtg1bL1BBk</a><br />Redstoner (Footage/Information) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRRY-qp_7CI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRRY-qp_7CI</a><br />0x22 (Information)<br />leijurv (Information)<br />xcc2 (Thumbnail Render)<br /><br /><br />If you enjoyed learning about The Scariest Week in Minecraft History, I would appreciate if you would consider hitting that like and subscribe button!<br />Hopefully the damage from the log4j vulnerability (log4shell) will not be too extreme.<br />2b2t is currently awaiting the 1.18/1.19 Caves &amp; Cliffs Minecraft update.
