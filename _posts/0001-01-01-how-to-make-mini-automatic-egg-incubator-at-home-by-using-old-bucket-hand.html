{% raw %}First of all am very thankful for watching my this video of automatic egg incubator . Recently I have made an simple and semiautomatic incubator in same bucket and hatched RIR chicks . After that many of my Subscribers Demanding me for making full automatic incubator in bucket ðŸª£. <br />             On public demand I decided to make this automatic video . Before month I started this project .<br />                    <br />              *Process <br /><br />           I simply cut off the front of the bucket for making screen to see the hatching and turning . The main problem was of turning eggs . The size of bucket was small and it's was very tough task to make an automatic eggs rotation in bucket . Finally an idea flash in my mind and I have made circular rotation system by attaching slow motion and powerful motor . I connected motor with the timer which turn on the motor after every 90minutes for 5second and eggs are rotated automatically after 90 mins . <br />    <br />       <br />    I have used dual temperature as well as temperature controller . I have used Donot humidifier for making humidity whick is very important . In this incubator I have incubated and hatched an duck eggs . U can also used chiken eggs as well . <br /><br /><br />* Material Required <br />   <br />  Empty bucket ðŸª£<br />  12v adopter ( 2 )<br />   12v DC fan<br />   220v Heater <br />  wires <br />   Duck eggs <br />  Donot humidifier <br />  Timer Controller <br />  220v Rotation motor<br />  Temperature and humidity controller<br />  screw and nuts <br />  wood sheet <br />    <br /><br /> I have mentioned all the material required to make this automatic incubator at home . If u have any problem related to any thing about this video comment me . <br /><br />         *Cautions <br />Set lower temperature 37.5 and upper 37.7 . set low humidity 50% and upper 60% . For duck eggs increase upper humidity for last 3 days UpTo 70% . stop rotation of eggs before 2 days of hatching . Never try to Rescue chick before time . <br /><br /><br />   I hope u have  enjoyed this home made automatic egg incubator for duck eggs as well as chicks and now u may be able to make Egg Incubator at home very easily and can hatch chicks . <br /><br /><br />      Don't forget to like subscribe &amp; comment me .<br />      @Mian inventions <br /><br />U may interested <br /><br /><br />HOMEMADE 100 EGGS INCUBATOR <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/c5HkLpjpHDk">https://youtu.be/c5HkLpjpHDk</a><br /><br /><br />Hatch eggs without incubator 100% real video<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/X7s6v-yZIdU">https://youtu.be/X7s6v-yZIdU</a><br /><br /><br />Beat idea to hatch eggs Without an temperature controller<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7SIWxU6qu2o">https://youtu.be/7SIWxU6qu2o</a><br />Music in this video<br /><br /><br />#eggincubator#egghatching#howtomake#mianinventions{% endraw %}
