The following question has been taken as example to elaborate the steps for indicating hit and miss in cache memory.<br /><br />Consider a small direct map cache with 32 blocks where the cache is initially empty. Block size is 16 Bytes. The following memory are referred 0x3E8, 0x3EC,0x3F0, 0x3F4, 0x9F8 and 0x9FC.  Design the map addresses to cache blocks and indicate whether hit or miss.  <br /><br />Other videos ( specially for Computer system architecture Course)<br />Computer Architecture: Pipeline and Non pipeline Comparison Problem<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/LqsjVA3W7Ho">https://youtu.be/LqsjVA3W7Ho</a><br /><br /><br />Pipelining Example with solution<br />A 4-stage pipeline has stage delays of 150, 120, 160, and 140 nanoseconds respectively. Registers that are used between the stages have a delay of 5 nanoseconds each. Assuming a constant clocking rate, how much total time is required to process 1000 data items on this pipeline.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Ti6GIqwE9T8">https://youtu.be/Ti6GIqwE9T8</a><br /><br />Other videos<br />Learn how to Draw State Transition Diagram by using State Transition Table: Digital Logic<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/gxsKXMSVZKg">https://youtu.be/gxsKXMSVZKg</a><br /><br />Mantissa and exponent of 5 representing in Binary floating-point<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0KlzR_8ApPs">https://youtu.be/0KlzR_8ApPs</a><br /><br />Binary Multiplication<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CEyx0BPj4bc">https://youtu.be/CEyx0BPj4bc</a>{% endraw %}
