{% raw %}How might we increase our empathy to become more kind, compassionate and understanding, and to encourage a more peaceful and loving society?<br /><br />&quot;One who is in spiritual union sees the true equality of all living beings, and responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were there own.&quot;<br />-Bhagavad Gita 6:32<br /><br />&quot;Love and compassion are necessities... Without them humanity cannot survive.&quot;<br />-The Dalai Lama<br /><br />If you find value in this content, please LIKE, SHARE and SUBSCRIBE.<br />You can also follow Awaken Insight on Facebook and Instagram.<br /><br />Background Music by Nada{% endraw %}
