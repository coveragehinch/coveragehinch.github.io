{% raw %}This is my 2022 Volvo V90 Cross Country Review. In this V90 Cross Country video I will give you a complete tour of this Volvo Wagon. The model I tested here is the 2022 Volvo V90 Cross Country B6 which is the only Volvo V90 2022 that you can now buy.<br /><br />The new Volvo V90 Cross Country receives a few other upgrades like minor exterior tweaks. There are some upgrades to the Volvo V90 Cross Country interior. The 2022 V90 Cross Country goes head-to-head with the Mercedes-Benz E-Class Wagon but it offers buyers much more for their money. There is also a battle of the Volvo Station Wagon - the V90 vs V60. The Volvo V90 CC is the larger brother. The 2022 Volvo V90 Cross Country B6 is an outstanding option in the luxury segment and is even a better option than some SUVs.
