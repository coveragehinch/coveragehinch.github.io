{% raw %}itzy says something beyond your expectations because they're crackheads (or maybe comedians).   Ryujin says the comment 'please kiss lia' when they were live. Itzy chaeryeong was so done with her and told her not to read it out of her mouth. Lia once said in an interview that the worst green vegetables would be cucumbers, it tastes like electricity. And it gives her some kind of microwave feelings. Itzy ryujin's shoulder dance in wannabe is famous in Korea and there is her confidence in herself as well as yuna's line in dalla dalla.<br /><br />🍎If you want to know itzy's behind stories ON and OFF stage,<br />you're in the right place.<br /><br />Let's get started.<br /><br />(Subscribe and you won't miss out any funny/sad/emotional moments)<br /><br />🍎Feel free to make reaction video<br /><br />🍎Business enquires: liapple721@gmail.com<br /><br />#itzy #있지{% endraw %}
