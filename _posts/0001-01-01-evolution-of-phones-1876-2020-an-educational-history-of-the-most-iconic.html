{% raw %}An educational history of the most iconic and important phones over the the existence of humanity. Starting with the origin of phones with the 1876 Liquid Transmitter we walk through through the evolution of phones in an easy to understand method by showing each major progression, whilst also seeing slight adaptions throughout.<br /><br />The images were heavily edited by me in Photoshop CS6 then gave the images a touch in Premiere Pro and Sony Vegas to give a new expression and feeling to this video. All you see in this video is the result of my hard work!<br /><br />This video is under fair use and it's not reused content, since it's all original content. If you enjoyed this video, be sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe and why not, share it! I spend a lot of time, working on this video..<br /><br />History of the phones over the years, from 1876 to 2020<br />Evolution of Phones{% endraw %}
