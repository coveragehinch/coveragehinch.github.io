{% raw %}Joe Biden's approval rating continues to drop after a November poll found just 37.8 per cent of voters approve of the job he's done as president while 59 per cent disapprove.<br /><br />The USA Today and Suffolk University poll surveyed 1,000 voters and found the Biden administration was continuing to see a decline in popularity.<br /><br />It found 46 per cent think the president has done a worse job than expected which included 16 per cent who had voted for him in the federal election.<br /><br />Vice President Kamala Harris' approval is also dire with just 27.8 per cent approving of her while 51.2 per cent disapprove.<br /><br />It also found nearly two thirds of Americans – 64 per cent – don’t want the president to run for a second term in 2024.<br /><br />The survey comes just one week after NBC News' poll found 71 per cent of voters believe the United States is &quot;heading off on the wrong track&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;That is 21 points under water, he has dropped more in his first year than any other president since world war II in terms of polling,&quot; said Fox News contributor Joe Concha.<br /><br />&quot;This is a big problem and Kamala Harris at 28 per cent approval – she's supposed to be the torch bearer if an 80-something-year-old Joe Biden doesn't want to run in 2024.<br /><br />&quot;With those numbers somebody warm up Gavin Newsom on the bench.&quot;{% endraw %}
