{% raw %}Provisioned to Overcome -- Discussed in this audio message: Husbands, fathers, wives, and mothers, Needs, wants, and things we dream about having, Order of priorities, 97% have done nothing in this area, The 3% Club, The Bible’s examples, Failed harvests in 2019 mean scarcities in 2020, What the Holy Spirit said to me recently, The echoes of my voice, Looking, writing down, and calculating how many, About money, where to start, and what to get, Bare-bones essentials to avoid skin-and-bones circumstances, ME Joseph—YOU Pharaoh!<br /><br />As husbands, fathers and grandfathers, and to some degree wives, mothers and grandmothers (especially mothers that have no husband in the home) we have a responsibility (before God) to provide for the needful things of our close family.  Men are expected to do what they can do to provide for and to protect and defend their wives and children; if a man will not do that he walks in denial of the Bible’s instructions.<br /><br />We spend our money in three areas: Needs, wants, and dreams (or desires).  Whether as individuals, married couples, or a family we all have needs, wants, and those more luxurious things that we or our school-age children only dream about.  In the physical realm we need to breath, drink water, and eat; we need to sleep, clothe ourselves, and be active in our physical bodies or we become way overweight or our joints freeze up.  We need a place to live and a way to get from place-to-place when it is more than a few short city blocks.  We need the help of a doctor or dentist or an optometrist when we are having trouble in our bodies.   A responsible man or woman understands that spending the money on such things must always be the priority. . .  <br /><br />. . . We need housing, food and clean water, basic transportation, and medical care from time-to-time.  We need a safe place to live, to be and keep things safe within our homes, and have some confidence that where our children are being taught is also safe for them (physically and spiritually!).  In the winter we must have warmth in the home as well as warm clothes to wear when we leave the home.  We need to pay the electric bill or get the car fixed before we would spend a small fortune by going to the movies or buying the latest game system or game cards.  To do things in any other order (providing for the wants or any luxury before the needs) is fool-hearty and irresponsible. . .<br /><br />As a teacher of God’s Word it is time for me to pointedly address what you as a husband and those as fathers and others as heads-of-households need to see-to if you have not done some significant work in this area yet.  And sisters-in-Christ—many of you also have a responsibility to participate in the things I will be sharing about today. . .{% endraw %}
