{% raw %}Lacan is one of the most difficult thinkers to read and decipher. With Lacan, he seems to have a language within a language. A mode(s) of communication that go beyond traditional lingual structures; a way of communicating power relations that has never been done. For this, Zizek has taken Lacan into his project among Marx and Hegel. Zizek has an interesting way of interpreting and applying Lacan.
