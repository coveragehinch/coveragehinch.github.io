{% raw %}A glacier has much more life to it than one might think at first glance. This 3D animated narration shows the yearly cycle of the glacier and how weather conditions affect its balance and thus its powerful effect on the land.<br /><br />Accumulation is a part of the installation Equilibrium which you find in an exhibition in Breheimsenteret in Jostedal, Norway.{% endraw %}
