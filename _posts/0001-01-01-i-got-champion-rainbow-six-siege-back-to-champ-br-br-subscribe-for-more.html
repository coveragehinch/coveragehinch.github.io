He is the team’s flex player, playing a wide variety of operators to fit whatever is needed for the map. Over the past few years, Beaulo became well known by many as a content creator, featuring his precise aim and overaggressive play on stream and YouTube while he could not officially compete due to age restrictions. His entry into the pro scene has come with a fair amount of hype, with many of his fans hoping to see him succeed in the Rainbow Six League.<br /><br />#RainbowSixSiege #R6S #Siege{% endraw %}
