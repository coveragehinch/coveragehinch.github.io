{% raw %}Tara Brach: Responding to Change with a Wise Heart (2018-04-25)<br /><br />An intrinsic part of spiritual life is facing the truth of impermanence.  When we open to the changing flow without resistance, we naturally cherish this passing life, and realize the timeless, changeless awareness that is our true home. Yet we are conditioned to grasp on to the passing pleasures (and all that we love) and resist the inevitable arising of stress and unpleasant experience. This talk includes teachings and guided reflections that help us identify the ways we are reacting to major changes in our life. We explore how to shift from reacting to meeting impermanence with an allowing presence; and then responding to our circumstances with wisdom and compassion. <br /><br />Listen: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tarabrach.com/responding-change-wise-heart/">https://www.tarabrach.com/responding-change-wise-heart/</a><br /><br />**********************************************************************<br /><br />Subscribe to Tara's podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ta...">http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ta...</a><br /> <br />Join Tara's email community to receive exclusive updates, events, meditations, and get a free download of Tara’s new 10 min meditation: “Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease&quot;:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/6YfI">http://eepurl.com/6YfI</a><br /><br />Your support will enable us to continue to offer these talks freely.
