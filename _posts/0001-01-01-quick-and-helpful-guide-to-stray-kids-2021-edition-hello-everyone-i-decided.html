{% raw %}hello everyone! i decided to make a new guide to stray kids :)<br />i really hope this helps, i restricted it on only the most memorable facts to not overwhelm you!<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br />i asked my followers on my instagram story to tell me the most memorable facts according to each member (i ended up with like 700 answers per member lmao). i wrote them down and chose the most &quot;voted&quot; facts they mentioned. so: please do not come at me because &quot;but member x is more than just fact y&quot; or anything like that, because i personally think these are the facts that are easy to connect the boys with and i think they are easy to remember. i know that there are way more things that are important according to each member but i wanted this guide to be quick and easy :)<br /><br />also: i know changbin is not necessarily the best rapper, for me he is cause he is my ult lmao but it's just my opinion<br /><br />follow my instagram @/josies.safeplace<br /><br />intro: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IocvwvcouBg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IocvwvcouBg</a><br />that fck boy sht song: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VdQgY9DOA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VdQgY9DOA</a><br />outro: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtIH5IlKMsg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtIH5IlKMsg</a><br /><br />the songs i used for each member intros are the instrumental versions of the following songs:<br />bang chan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAPXc0M4tLg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAPXc0M4tLg</a><br />lee know: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ywY7yDhvWM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ywY7yDhvWM</a><br />changbin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAdUFFHbJ2U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAdUFFHbJ2U</a><br />hyunjin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQXv864OnXc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQXv864OnXc</a><br />jisung: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dab4EENTW5I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dab4EENTW5I</a><br />felix: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQTlCHxyuu8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQTlCHxyuu8</a><br />seungmin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyH3PqBQY3Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyH3PqBQY3Y</a><br />jeongin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y289In1OdZI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y289In1OdZI</a>{% endraw %}
