{% raw %}I never really listen to Matt Slick much as he tends to stick with his theological rhetoric that I am just not that interested in...however on the Bible Thumping Wingnut Network the other day he was asked questions about what he thought about the age of the Earth...and holy cow I had no idea Matt Slick was this scientifically illiterate. He actually said he thinks that the Earth is young, &quot;less than millions of years&quot; and used some of the most debunked YEC claims imaginable (Moon dust accumulation! Pleochroic polonium halos! Polystrate trees!)...I mean ok, I knew Matt had some type of learning disability or mental block when he couldn't even understand Dr. Alex Malpass trying to explain to him that his TAG argument was dead on arrival...but damn, this takes a level of scientific ignorance to a whole new level.<br /><br />Patreon- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/stevemcrae">https://www.patreon.com/stevemcrae</a><br />Facebook- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/steveaskanything">https://www.facebook.com/steveaskanything</a><br />Twitter- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SteveMcRae_">https://twitter.com/SteveMcRae_</a><br />Pinterest- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/stevemcrae">https://www.pinterest.com/stevemcrae</a><br />PayPal- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/StevenMcRae">https://www.paypal.me/StevenMcRae</a><br />Amazon wish list- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/24YTG8A44QU83/ref=cm_wl_list_o_0?">https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/24YTG8A44QU83/ref=cm_wl_list_o_0?</a><br /><br />You can also support my channel directly from my YouTube page.You can also support my channel directly from my YouTube page via fan funding (the blue SUPPORT button).
