{% raw %}In this video, I have three cute Christmas DIYs to share. I am using tools and materials that I already had in my stash but take the ideas and use the materials that you have. Also, I am using my Cricut machine to make cute vinyl cutouts. If you don't have a Cricut or any cutting machine, you can check on Etsy for sellers who do customs cut vinyls. <br /><br />I got some gingerbread inspo from The Sorry Girls Christmas DIY video, you can check out the DIY gingerbread doormat video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyAcr4i-Q0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyAcr4i-Q0</a><br /><br />This video is not sponsored by Cricut.
