And most importantly that it lives to the expectations of the new owner.<br /><br />Certified Pre Owned cars are usually more expensive that conventional used cars because of the inspection and reconditioning process that they go through.<br /><br />I'll first explain the important differences between Certified cars and regular used cars. Then we'll start the process on the Sales department side on what they do before they even request certification from the Service department.<br /><br />Once the Sales department does their due diligence to make sure that this car is worthy of certification then it heads over to the service department and the inspection journey begins.<br /><br />The first thing in any technicians agenda for the Certified Inspection is surprisingly to knock the car off certification believe it or not. We want to make sure that this car doesn't have deal breakers. Things that would disqualify this car from certification regardless if it can be repaired or not.<br /><br />Things like major accidents, Poor maintenance history or even excess wear and tear.<br /><br />Certified inspections leave nothing unchecked.
