{% raw %}Elon Musk To Produce Tesla Phone With Built-In Starlink WIFI<br /><br />üîî Subscribe with notification turned on for more Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Tesla and Space videos!<br /><br />His newest plan comes completely out of the left-field as every indication points to the fact that we might soon have a new brand of mobile phones in the market, produced by Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla.<br /><br />What will the mobile phone look like and what will be it be called? What differential features will it likely have?<br /><br />And most importantly, when can we expect Elon Musk to make an official announcement and make it available for purchase? <br /><br />He has spent the last two decades accomplishing the inconceivable, changing the car and space industries on his own. <br />Musk has never stated openly if he intends to enter the crowded smartphone manufacturing industry. <br />However, rumors had been flying out of Tesla factories for quite some time.<br />Based on such reports, in 2018, designer Martin Hajek created a mockup of what a Tesla smartphone may look like if Musk ever decides to make a linked gadget for his electric automobiles.<br />As one might expect, the hypothetical Tesla Model P smartphone by Martin Hajek has a sculptural form that resembles Tesla automobiles. <br /><br />A spine-like fin that runs from the top to the bottom of the gadget, which has a glossy red finish, is a tribute to Tesla's instantly recognizable design DNA.<br />The device's carbon fiber speaker grill adds sportiness, while the notch for the front camera is odd, like the front grille of a Tesla Model S / X. <br />Instead of a boxy form, the smartphone sports a rounded style comparable to Tesla automobiles, with a curved display on the edges. <br />Overall, the Tesla Model P smartphone prototype appears luxury and, even in 2021, is nothing like existing phones on the market.<br /><br />üì∫ Watch the entire video so you don't miss any information!<br /><br /> Subscribe To Our Channel Here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3myAZOn">https://bit.ly/3myAZOn</a><br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />About Tech Fusion<br />üé• Videos about Elon Musk, SpaceX, Tesla, Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin and more.<br />üîî Subscribe for more Elon Musk, SpaceX, Tesla, Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin and more.<br />üìù Written, voiced and produced by Tech Fusion<br /><br />Watch More from Tech Fusion<br />üëë Elon Musk: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...</a><br />üöÄ SpaceX / Blue Origin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...</a><br />üöó Tesla: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...</a><br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />üíº Business Inquiries, Copyright or Contact<br />‚Ä¢ For business inquiries, copyright matters or other inquiries please contact us at: viraladdictionyt@gmail.com<br /><br />‚ùì Copyright Questions<br />‚Ä¢ If you have any questions or issues regarding copyright, you can contact us at viraladdictionyt@gmail.com<br /><br />‚ö†Ô∏è Copyright Disclaimers<br />‚Ä¢ Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act states: ‚ÄúNotwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.‚Äù <br />‚Ä¢ We use images and content in accordance with the YouTube Fair Use copyright guidelines<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />#TeslaPhone #ModelPi #tsla{% endraw %}
