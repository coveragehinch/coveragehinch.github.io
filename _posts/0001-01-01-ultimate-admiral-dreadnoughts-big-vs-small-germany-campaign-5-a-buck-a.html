And actually, my money is on the small!<br /><br />The Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts campaign is still in its early stages. Future versions of the campaign are planned to include more nations, diplomacy, strategic options (minelayers, submarines) and various other options. The Dreadnoughts campaigns doesn't look like much yet, but let's give it some time.<br /><br />Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts Intro music: &quot;Goliath&quot; by Scott Buckley - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYTJ8hDj_Hc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYTJ8hDj_Hc</a> - www.scottbuckley.com.au<br /><br />This video is not intended for children.<br /><br />⭐ Support the channel and my content⭐<br />▪️ Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/stealth17gaming">https://www.patreon.com/stealth17gaming</a><br /><br />😀 Social<br />▪️ Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/u4MaS5fqyg">https://discord.gg/u4MaS5fqyg</a><br />▪️ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Stealth17Gaming">https://twitter.com/Stealth17Gaming</a><br />▪️ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Stealth17Gaming">https://www.facebook.com/Stealth17Gaming</a><br /><br />▶ Send in your gameplay<br />▪️ Wargame replays: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.stealth17gaming.com/send-me-your-wargame-replays/">http://www.stealth17gaming.com/send-me-your-wargame-replays/</a><br /><br />👍 Patreon Supporters<br />▪️ Major General Metzger<br />▪️ Major General Stone<br />▪️ Major General Gosrith<br /><br />▪️ Colonel Brendryen<br />▪️ Colonel Driver<br />▪️ Colonel Dotts<br />▪️ Colonel Lord_Daniel_DE<br /><br />▪️ Lt Colonel Elfwyn<br />▪️ Lt Col Talisman<br /><br />▪️ Major 4nge1us<br />▪️ Major Aura<br />▪️ Major BeerDrinker<br />▪️ Major Casey H<br />▪️ Major Titus<br />▪️ Major Chung<br />▪️ Major JFHeasy<br />▪️ Major Duck<br />▪️ Major NorCalRoach<br />▪️ Major Brown<br />▪️ Major Gray<br />▪️ Major Osperey28<br />▪️ Major Rule303<br />▪️ Major Th3 Narrat0r<br />▪️ Major ThePisswasser<br /><br />▪️ Captain Stanec<br />▪️ Captain Dave<br />▪️ Captain Siegert<br />▪️ Captain Fuentes<br />▪️ Captain Martinez<br />▪️ Captain K G<br />▪️ Captain Braugh<br />▪️ Captain Lund<br />▪️ Captain Bremner<br />▪️ Captain Madison<br />▪️ Captain Maverick<br />▪️ Captain Moore<br />▪️ Captain Karuppiah<br />▪️ Captain Wolf O' Wales<br /><br />❓ FAQ<br />▪️ PC specs: <br />Ryzen 5 2600X - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3it3Bov">https://amzn.to/3it3Bov</a><br />GeForce 980TI - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TnWkhn">https://amzn.to/2TnWkhn</a><br />Kingston HyperX FURY 32 GB DDR4 3200 MHz - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3mPsFKp">https://amzn.to/3mPsFKp</a><br />Seagate FireCuda 520 SSD 1TB - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3iwMKRG">https://amzn.to/3iwMKRG</a><br />Keyboard Corsair K70 Mk2 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2YaEDUv">https://amzn.to/2YaEDUv</a><br />Mouse Logitech G502 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hOf9n8">https://amzn.to/3hOf9n8</a><br /><br />▪️ Recommended Youtube tools?<br />Tubebuddy!

There is a pretty good chance that I've already covered it. I know what games my audience and I like playing ;).<br /><br />Why won't you play War Thunder?<br />▪️ I raged at getting sniped by tanks that I could never see. Also nonsense like turning bushes off that helps you perform better. That seems like a terrible design to me. War Thunder also had drama several years ago about the CEO calling the fanbase to help strike down channels or using copyright strikes to eliminate channels entirely. That is such abuse of power and dictatorial nonsense that I refuse to play a game created by such a company.<br /><br />Why does your video have so many ads?! <br />▪️ Please read this community post: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2mwsE-87Hfh9ZmSrqBqNIg/community?lb=Ugy1UTYLGYDSaeYB1Wh4AaABCQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2mwsE-87Hfh9ZmSrqBqNIg/community?lb=Ugy1UTYLGYDSaeYB1Wh4AaABCQ</a><br /><br />Some of the links in this description are affiliate links.{% endraw %}
