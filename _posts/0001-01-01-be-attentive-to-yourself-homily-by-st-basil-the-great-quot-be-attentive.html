{% raw %}&quot;Be attentive to yourself, lest an unlawful word come to be hidden in your heart&quot; (Deut 15:9). This text serves as the basis for St. Basil's exhortation to be focused on ourselves and our sins, not the cares of this world or the sins of our brother. With beautiful imagery and inspired insight, this homily teaches us the importance of attending to every thought, for it is the mind first that harbors secret sins and it is the Great Physician that is ready to heal us.<br /><br /><br /><br />St. Basil the Great is known as one of the three Holy Hierarchs of Cappadocia, along with St. John Chrysostom and St. Gregory the Theologian. We commemorate St. Basil on January 1st and 30th.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is a reading of the following sermon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.orthodoxprayer.org/Articles_files/Basil-Be%20Attentive.pdf">https://www.orthodoxprayer.org/Articles_files/Basil-Be%20Attentive.pdf</a><br /><br /><br /><br />This channel is dedicated to sharing the prayers, hymns, teachings, and service texts of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Glory to Jesus Christ!{% endraw %}
