They are just chasing a &quot;unicorn&quot; without thinking deeply, or not learning what they really have to learn.  <br /><br />There are only two things you need to master to become a winning trader:<br /><br />1. To be able to identify the psychology of the players in a market.<br /><br />2. The skill to make entries right at where the risk is kept to a minimum and reward is at absolute maximum. If you have the skill to be able to identify it, you do not need any complex methods or indicators.<br /><br />The intent of this channel is to explain life-lasting methods in a very simple manner.<br /><br /><br />** Disclaimer **<br /><br />- The videos and blogs are provided based on my personal view from the past experience and for educational purpose, and never guarantee your future profits. <br />- I do not make your trade decisions.
