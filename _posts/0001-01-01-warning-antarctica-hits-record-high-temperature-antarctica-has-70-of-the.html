{% raw %}Antarctica has 70% of the Earth's fresh water frozen in a large ice sheet, about 4.8 km thick. Recently, On February 6, 2020, scientists have recorded highest Antarctic temperature. A temperature of 18.3Â°C in the southern polar region making it one of the fastest-warming places on Earth. The previous record was 17.5Â°C recorded in year 2015.<br /><br />It has been found that in last 50 years the Antarctic temperature has risen by almost 3Â°C. Research has shown that if temperature increases by 2Â°C more it would cause a serious melting of ice sheets. Raising the world ocean levels by over 13 meters flooding several coastal cities and Island nations.<br /><br />What if You Stand on Different Planets?<br />Watch HereðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/02A9h10_fyg">https://youtu.be/02A9h10_fyg</a><br /><br />SubscribeðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/MrScientific">https://youtube.com/MrScientific</a><br /><br />Get a free copy of my latest book Baby Universe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Baby-Universe-Book">https://bit.ly/Baby-Universe-Book</a><br /><br />Second ChannelðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/MrScientificLive">https://youtube.com/MrScientificLive</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/MrScientific">https://instagram.com/MrScientific</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/ScientificMr">https://facebook.com/ScientificMr</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ScientificMr">https://twitter.com/ScientificMr</a>{% endraw %}
