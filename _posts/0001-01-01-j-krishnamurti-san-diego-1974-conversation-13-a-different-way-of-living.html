{% raw %}J. Krishnamurti - San Diego 1974 - Conversation 13 - A different way of living<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Q: What is living?<br /><br />What actually is existence, living, this whole field of man's endeavour to better himself, not only in the technological world but also psychologically? Man wants to be different, he wants to be more than he is.<br /><br />Isn't the way we live most impractical, an insane way of living, destructive, with utter indifference to the earth? Is this the way to behave, to appreciate the beauty of living? Is there a way of living without conflict?<br /><br />As a human being am I ever conscious? And what is consciousness? Is consciousness its content? Is death a continuity of that consciousness, or the ending of consciousness with its content?<br /><br />---<br /><br />This channel is managed by the Krishnamurti Foundation Trust​​, UK​, and by the Krishnamurti Foundation of America.<br /><br />The role of the foundations was described by Krishnamurti when he said,​ ​'The foundations will see to it that these teachings are kept whole, are not distorted, are not made corrupt. They will not give rise to any sectarian spirit in their activities... nor create any kind of place of worship around the teachings or the person.​'​<br /><br />We maintain extensive archives of Krishnamurti's original works and all four Krishnamurti foundations are actively engaged in the publication of material in various forms.<br /><br />Our videos contain thousands of subtitles in more than 25 languages, translated by volunteers from all over the world. If you would like to help us with translating subtitles, please contact us at digital@kfoundation.org<br /><br />For more information about J.
