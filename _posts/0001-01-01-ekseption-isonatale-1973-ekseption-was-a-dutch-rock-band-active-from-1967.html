{% raw %}Ekseption was a Dutch rock band active from 1967 to 1989, playing mostly-instrumental progressive rock and classical rock. The central character in the changing roster, and the only band member present on every album, was conservatory-trained trumpeter Rein van den Broek (10 September 1945 - 11 May 2015). The band knew some commercial success in the 1970s, having Dutch top ten hit singles with their adaptations of Beethoven's &quot;Fifth&quot; and Bach's (Celebrated) &quot;Air.&quot; The second album, &quot;Beggar Julia's time trip&quot; (1969), won the Dutch Edison Award for album of the year, and the first five albums all went gold.{% endraw %}
