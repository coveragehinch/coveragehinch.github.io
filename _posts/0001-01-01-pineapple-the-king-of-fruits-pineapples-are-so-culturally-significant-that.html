{% raw %}Pineapples are so culturally significant that pineapples adorn the tops of cathedrals, and serve as the domicile of one of the worldâ€™s most popular cartoon characters.  An estimated 300 billion pineapples are farmed each year, and a 2021 YouGov poll lists pineapples as the sixth most favorite fruit, ahead of all varieties of apples and oranges. <br /><br />This is original content based on research by The History Guy.
