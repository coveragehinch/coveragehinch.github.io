{% raw %}This Part Of Thailand Keeps Surprising Me ‚Äì Isan Thailand Trip Ep. 6<br />Meeting the local people of Isan Thailand ‚û° <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/XYKYgIzkyE0">https://youtu.be/XYKYgIzkyE0</a><br /><br />I made it to Nong Khai, a small town right on the Mekong River in Isan Thailand. On the other side of the river, we can see Laos. Also, the capital of Laos, Vientiane isn‚Äôt far away from Nong Khai. Just a 40 minutes ride. So, I thought it would be interesting to jump on the bike and ride from Nong Khai to Vientiane, at least to the point where we can see it from the Thailand side. Join me on yet another journes here through Isan Thailand. <br /><br />Find the Full Isan Thailand Trip Playlist here<br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3oOqJlY">https://bit.ly/3oOqJlY</a><br />The location of Naga Statues at the beginning<br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/sp9MLWRFDAwZqppr8">https://goo.gl/maps/sp9MLWRFDAwZqppr8</a><br /><br />#Thailand #travelthailand #isan<br />---------------------------------------- <br />üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èA B O U T M E <br />I am Ken Abroad, a full-time traveler traveling southeast Asia, currently living in Thailand, making Thailand travel vlogs.
