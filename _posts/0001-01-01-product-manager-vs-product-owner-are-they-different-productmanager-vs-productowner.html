The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.<br /><br />The Product Owner is responsible for:<br /> â€¢ Effectively managing the Product Backlog<br /> â€¢ Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal<br /> â€¢ Creating and clearly communication Product Backlog items<br /> â€¢ Ordering Product Backlog items<br /> â€¢ And Ensuring the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.<br /><br />Product Owners can help the team to analyze risks, technology considerations and trade-offs with budget and time considerations. Product Owners become the experts and guardians of the backlog, as well as the team member that facilitates communications, ensuring everyone is on the same page.<br /><br />In a startup, the Product Owner might have all of these responsibilities and in all practical senses, they might be doing the role of a Product Manager.<br /><br />But when you scale the company, the teams, the stakeholders, the role of the Product Owner tends to deviate from what they are supposed to do. As the teams grow and do a mix of Agile with Waterfall or other techniques, the Product Owner is tasked to focus more on the team productivity or velocity, cross-team dependencies and prioritizing the backlog of their team, loosing that vision of the big picture and what benefits customers the most. <br />In other words, they start to loose responsibilities and the power to make business decisions that benefit the customer and they focus much more on stakeholder management, cross-team dependencies and managing their team's backlog.<br /><br />How is this different than Product Management?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dJmg4ODH0YY">https://youtu.be/dJmg4ODH0YY</a><br /><br />Notes on PM vs PO:<br />The Product Owner role exists within scrum. If you take scrum and agile out of your development process then the role of the Product Owner does not exist.<br /><br />If you are a Product Manager and your team is using scrum, most likely you are also a Product Owner. If your team is not using Scrum, you are still a Product Manager. <br /><br />The Product Manager job does not depend on scrum, but the ROLE of Product Owner does depend on scrum.<br />FAQ:<br />Can you be a Product Owner and not be a Product Manager? Yes, Product Owner is a Role, not a job. You can have any other job and be the product owner.<br /><br />Can you be a Product owner and then become a Product Manager? Yes, In fact, you can be anything else and then become a Product Manager. Being a Product Owner gives you experience with managing backlog, customer requests, working with development teams. It is just one of the many ways that you can get into Product Management.<br /><br />I saw a job posting that looked like Product Management but the title is Product Owner? Which one is it? Many companies still confuse the role of a Product Owner and the job of a Product Manager. If the job description and the responsibilities are those of a Product Manager, most likely you will be a product manager, even if the title is different. <br /><br />---<br />#productmanager #productowner #pm #interview #career #MBA #informationalinterview  #jobsearch #technology #programmanager{% endraw %}
