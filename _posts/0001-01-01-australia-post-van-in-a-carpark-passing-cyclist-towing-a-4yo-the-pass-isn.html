{% raw %}The pass isn't overly close, but the driving itself is quite aggressive. He was on my tail, engine revving, and had barely let me move to the &quot;bike lane&quot; before he started passing me. Ordinarily I'd shrug it off, but I was in a shopping centre carpark, and had my 4yo son in the trailer behind me!{% endraw %}
