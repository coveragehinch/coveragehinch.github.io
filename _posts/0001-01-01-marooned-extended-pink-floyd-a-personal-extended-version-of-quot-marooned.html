{% raw %}A personal extended version of &quot;Marooned&quot; by Pink Floyd. Enjoy.<br /><br />1 hour Marooned: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePmiIM59ook">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePmiIM59ook</a><br /><br /><br />Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhae59yzRvjsjIYUTE9MhWl5OtNH5lPJ5">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhae59yzRvjsjIYUTE9MhWl5OtNH5lPJ5</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Picture: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/4HQpl60.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/4HQpl60.jpg</a><br /><br /><br />Recently more and more people complained about having too many ads on this video. I'd like to inform you, that I'm not monetizing my stuff, so every monetization that appears comes from the actual owners of the songs. Most videos I upload are allowed to stay online, but with tons of ads instead, the rest gets taken down, like my Echoes 1 hour loop version. There's nothing I can do about it.{% endraw %}
