{% raw %}From the director of Fatal Attraction comes a steamy thriller about physical passion so intense, it consumes everything - and everyone - in its path.  Edward and Connie Summer (Richard Gere, Diane Lane) have the perfect life: a happy marriage, an eight year old son, and a beautiful house in the suburbs.  But when Connie's chance encounter with a handsome stranger (Olivier Martinez) erupts into a full-blown affair, desire becomes obsession, and the true price of betrayal takes a shattering toll.  Pulsing with heart-pounding suspense and erotic thrills, Unfaithful is sexy, stylish and seductive!{% endraw %}
