Laughs. <br />And I don’t know what to say <br />With grief swimming in my chest <br />And stirring in my back <br />So I give, I give <br />I give it all away <br /><br />I’m willing <br />Clutching in a warm embrace <br />Seeing my sister’s face <br />I was willing <br />I was willing <br />I was willing<br /><br />Like what you see?
