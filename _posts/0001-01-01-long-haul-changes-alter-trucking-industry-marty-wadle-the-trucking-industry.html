{% raw %}The trucking industry was short thousands of drivers in February of 2020. Since the onset of the pandemic, that number has jumped dramatically as the need to get goods over the road from the dock to the warehouse and eventually the retail outlet has strained the supply chain. Marty Wadle is the chief commercial officer for Ruan Transportation. He sees changes in realtime happening in how the company and industry have had to recruit, retain and improve employment conditions for drivers. Wadley says one law change could help entice younger workers into the industry, along with relay routes, non-contact handoffs and pay increases. Thanks to the Iowa Intermediary Network and its partners in making this episode.{% endraw %}
