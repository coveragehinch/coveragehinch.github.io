This may seem wrong since the universe is created in the Big Bang, around 13.8 billion years ago. According to some, Azathoth may be responsible for this. <br />The Cthulhu mythos is a combination of many books written by many different authors aside from the great H.P Lovecraft himself. As by his wishes, he left the Cthulhu universe as an open book for competent writers to fill in the gaps and expand the franchise. This timeline is based on canonical books, like the timeline of the Cthulhu mythos, the challenge from beyond by Moore, where Yidhra walks by De Bill just to name a few. In this video, we shall only showcase the most important events in the timeline, especially the ones that date back millions or billions of years ago and which also is proposed to extent millions and billions of years in the future. Modern human interaction or birthdates are omitted as it will be too confusing taking into account the variety of books and works by many authors. <br /><br />FAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER<br /> * Copyright Disclaimer under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
