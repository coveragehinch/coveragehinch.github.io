Whoever installed the ball joint forgot to install the snap ring for the ball joint and the cotter pin for the nut. The mechanic even test drove this, which is scary!<br />0:22 The mechanic mentioned this regarding the clip &quot;It was sitting deep in snow when he deactivated/activated it and the actuator crap the bed completely, this is the result. Replaced actuator and cables, good as new.&quot;<br />0:35 A directional tire: The tread pattern on directional tires is distinct and differs from other tread patterns in that it is designed to rotate in only one direction. The unusual thing is that the rotation arrow is pointing towards the opposites ways on each sidewall. Mechanic said they were some cheap tires the customers got, which explain it. <br />0:49 Looks to be paint underneath this Cadillac. What do you think? And I wonder the full story behind this. The mechanic also said their wasn't any visible damage underneath as well.<br />1:04 The silicone they used seemed to not be doing the job, so hopefully they install a oil pan gasket soon!<br />1:14 If I recall these fuel filters are pretty easy to install. You just need to push them in and you hear a small click. Removing them is usually harder (need the right tool).<br />1:23 The mechanic also mentioned this cost around $6500 to fix.<br />1:36 It's not paint but looks like it lol. The mechanic said the rear differential was completely broken.<br />1:52 First time seeing this! The customer must have hit a curb at the right angle/speed to do that kind of damage.<br />2:00 An expensive pot hole. OEM rims are always expensive. <br />2:09 Came in for a driveline concern (rear u-joint failure). But wow those brake lines are extended. The 2 inch lift on it probably doesn't help lol.<br />2:30 Thought this was cool and wanted to share. Hopefully I pronounced Vauxhall correctly.<br />2:40 Let's hope they don't drive in a puddle! That's a pretty low spot for the engine air filter<br />2:50 A very sandy engine air filter from a 2017 Ford Ranger (Diesel, from Australia).<br />2:57 Outro. Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
