They all sprang up within a relatively short period of time and constitute — in combination with some faithful homages — what’s called the Second Chicago School of Architecture. This timeline makes it seem like Mies' strategies sprang out of nowhere and like they were born already fully developed. This video takes a look at how these tower strategies evolved from smaller projects to larger ones by paying special attention to their section. Whereas open plans promise ultimate fluidity, in section, Mies' buildings present another idea entirely. In this direction, difference and discretion dominate and symmetry rules. All of this is in service of developing a close connection between the occupant and the distant horizon.<br /><br />__Chapters__<br />00:00 Introduction<br />01:16 Altas VPN Sponsorship<br />02:20 Farnsworth House<br />02:52 Friedrichstrasse Tower Competition<br />05:09 Barcelona Pavilion<br />08:21 Tugendaht House<br />09:43 Crown Hall<br />11:12 860 - 880 Lakeshore Drive<br /><br />__Membership__<br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYAm24PkejQR2xMgJgn7xwg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYAm24PkejQR2xMgJgn7xwg/join</a><br /><br />__About the Channel__<br />Architecture with Stewart is a YouTube journey exploring architecture’s deep and enduring stories in all their bewildering glory.
