{% raw %}Meg Tirrell joins 'Closing Bell' with news on AstraZeneca's Covid-19 cocktail. And the FDA is expected to expand booster eligibility to all adults. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi">https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi</a> <br /><br />Around 2% of the world’s population is thought to be at risk of not responding well to Covid-19 vaccines, according to AstraZeneca. This includes people receiving dialysis treatment, undergoing chemotherapy and those taking immunosuppressive drugs for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.<br /><br />The phase three clinical trial was conducted across 87 sites in five countries: the U.S., the U.K., Spain, Belgium and France. A total of 5,197 people took part, with 3,460 receiving 300 milligrams of AZD7442 and 1,737 being given a saline placebo.<br /><br />The six-month assessment included data from 4,991 of the participants, with those who chose to leave the trial to get vaccinated being excluded from the data analysis. Subjects will continue to be assessed for 15 months.<br /><br />‘Compelling results’<br /><br />In a separate trial, patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 who were given one dose of AZD7442 within three days of developing symptoms had their risk of developing severe disease reduced by 88%.<br /><br />Half of this trial’s 903 participants were given 600 mg of AZD7442, while the other half were given a placebo.<br /><br />Ninety percent of those included in the second study were considered to be at high risk of developing severe Covid-19 if they contracted the virus.<br /><br />The trials’ full results have not yet been peer-reviewed, but are set be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal.<br /><br />AstraZeneca said both trials showed that AZD7442 was “generally well tolerated.”<br /><br />“These compelling results give me confidence that this long-acting antibody combination can provide my vulnerable patients with the long-lasting protection they urgently need to finally return to their everyday lives,” Hugh Montgomery, professor of intensive care medicine at University College London and principal investigator in the trials, said in a press release Thursday.<br /><br />“Importantly, six months of protection was maintained despite the surge of the delta variant among these high-risk participants who may not respond adequately to vaccination.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at AstraZeneca, said AZD7442 was the only long-acting antibody treatment that had phase three data to demonstrate its efficacy in both preventing and treating Covid-19 with one dose.<br /><br />“We are progressing regulatory filings around the world and look forward to providing an important new option against SARS-CoV-2 as quickly as possible,” he said.<br /><br />Other companies developing antibody treatments include GSK, Regeneron and Eli Lilly. All three have been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA.<br /><br />In October, AstraZeneca announced it had asked the FDA for emergency use authorization for AZD7442 as a preventative treatment. It has not yet been granted.<br /><br />The pharmaceutical giant has agreed to supply the U.S. government with 700,000 doses of its antibody treatment if that request is granted. It also has agreements in place to supply AZD7442 to other countries.<br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a> <br /><br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
