We shared experiences and lessons learned by those attending the webinar, and enabled attendees to pose questions and provide comments during the session.<br /><br />Talking points included: sweeping reform regarding judicial and legislative proposals; day-to-day changes, including the treatment of stays, choice of forum, number of claims asserted, selection of experts, and percentage and timing of settlement; the emergence of a new breed of patent litigators.{% endraw %}
