{% raw %}Typhoon Rai Update - So many of you have asked me for updates on different areas in the Philippines, but I'm afraid I'm stuck on Leyte, in a city without power, so I'm almost as much in the dark as you are!  But here's what I DO know ....<br /><br />👉My videos and the effort I put into them are 100% free for everyone to enjoy, and all I ask is that you leave a thumbs-up on any videos that you like and subscribe to my channel - I have never, and will never, ask you for anything else.  For those of you that still wish to support my channel further, however, I’ve posted my links below.
