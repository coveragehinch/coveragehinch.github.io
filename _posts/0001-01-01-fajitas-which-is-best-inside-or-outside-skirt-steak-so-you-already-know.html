{% raw %}So you already know that the traditional and most popular FAJITA is the inside skirt cut of beef – but today I’m going to show you the OTHER cut of fajita which is the other true SKIRT STEAK – THE OUTSIDE FAJITA.<br /><br />It’s a little smaller but much bigger in tenderness, softer and easier to chew, and great tasting beefy flavor. We’re gonna trim it, season it (no marinade this time, doesn’t need it) and then cook it hot and fast!<br /><br />…and then there is a little bonus sirloin “fajita” which is not really a fajita….confused yet? It’s okay, I used to be too! Let’s fire it up and talk more about FAJITAS!{% endraw %}
