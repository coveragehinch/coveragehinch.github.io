{% raw %}The Armenian language, being one of the most unique Indo-European languages, is known for its two standard forms, Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian. Eastern Armenian is spoken in the Republic of Armenia, as well as by the Armenian diaspora in countries such as Iran, Russia, Georgia, and other post-Soviet countries. Western Armenian, on the other hand, is primarily spoken by the Armenians in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, the other parts of the Middle East, as well as South American countries. There are many different varieties, dialects, and accents in both standard forms. Every region in Armenia, and almost every village, has its own dialect. Also, among the diaspora, varieties and dialects have been created that are unique only to them, in which words from other languages (e.g. Persian, Turkish or Russian) are often found. This, of course, has its historical basis. In this video, several different dialects will be presented and discussed.<br /><br />Please contact me on Instagram if you would like to participate in a future video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/BahadorAlast">https://www.instagram.com/BahadorAlast</a><br /><br />Teni: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tenipanosian/">https://www.instagram.com/tenipanosian/</a><br />Jessica: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/j.mkita/">https://www.instagram.com/j.mkita/</a><br />Zack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/zackoarian/">https://www.instagram.com/zackoarian/</a><br />Antic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/its_antic/">https://www.instagram.com/its_antic/</a><br /><br />Armenia is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. Despite the fact that throughout history it has been invaded and occupied by numerous different empires and foreign forces, and although Armenians have on different occasions adopted and implemented new beliefs and ideas into their culture, they have always managed to maintain and preserve their unique identity and language, from the time of the Kingdom of Urartu (also known as Kingdom of Van) going back to the 9th century BCE, to the time of the Orontid dynasty when most Armenians adopted Zoroastrianism, to the early part of the 4th century when Armenia became the first nation to officially adopt Christianity as a state religion. In the ensuing centuries, Armenia witnessed the invasion of numerous different empires, and ultimately in the 19th century, following the war between Iran and Russia, a significant part of historic Eastern Armenia which had been under Iranian control, was annexed by the Russian Empire as per the Treaty of Turkmenchay. While Eastern Armenia remained under Russian control, the historic Western Armenia was under the control of the Ottoman Empire. But as the WWI came to an end and both empires collapsed, parts of historical Armenia gained independence and by 1918 the First Republic of Armenia was established. In the years that followed, after several wars and conflicts, the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (also known as Soviet Armenia) was established as part of the Soviet Union and remained as such until the 1990s. In the summer of 1990, Armenia declared its independence from the Soviet Union which was confirmed a year later by a referendum, and as the Soviet Union collapsed, the independence of Armenia as sovereign nation became widely recognized.<br /><br /><br />In the post-Soviet era, Armenia has been very successful in linguistic de-Russification and today Armenian (հայերէն / հայերեն) continues to be written in its own writing system, the Armenian alphabet, which was introduced by Mesrop Mashtots in the 5th century.<br /><br /><br />The most widespread Armenian dialect today is the Yerevan dialect (Երևանի բարբառ), an Eastern Armenian dialect composed primarily of Classical Armenian (Grabar) words, with some influence from other languages such as Russian and Persian. Other Eastern dialects include the ancient Artsakh dialect, also referred to as the Karabakh dialect, Parskahayeren, which is spoken by Iranian Armenians, as well as many dialects within Armenia, and several others which are no longer spoken.<br /><br /><br />Western Armenian, which is based mainly on the Istanbul Armenian dialect, also has many subdialects and accents. Historically, there were many different Western Armenian dialects which are now extinct. The dialects which have survived include, among others, Homshetsi (Հոմշեցի / Hemşince), which is spoken by the Hemshin people in northeastern Turkey, Abkhazia, Russia, and Central Asia; the dialects spoken in Syria and Lebanon, such as those in Kessab (كسب), Latakia (اللاذقية), Jisr al-Shughur (جسر الشغور), and Anjar (عنجر); the dialects spoken by the Armenians in Istanbul and Vakıflı (Վաքըֆ), the only remaining Armenian village in Turkey, the Mush dialect (Մշոյ բարբառ) which used to be spoken in the city of Muş in present-day eastern Turkey, but today it is nearly extinct and its remaining few native speakers are scattered in villages in Armenia and three Armenian-populated villages in the Samtskhe-Javakheti province of Georgia, the Karin dialect, which used to be primarily spoken in the city of Erzurum in present-day eastern Turkey, but nowadays, it is mainly spoken in northwestern Armenia, in places such as Gyumri, Artik, Akhuryan, and Aghin.{% endraw %}
