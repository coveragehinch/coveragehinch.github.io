{% raw %}Remember, this is just SIX MONTHS after 9/11. In response to a reporters question, President Bush tells the world that he is &quot;truly not that concerned&quot; with catching the man who murdered 3,000 Americans just six months and two days earlier because &quot;we've marginalized him.&quot;<br /><br />Please note that he ALMOST says &quot;I don't know where he is, nor do I... (really care).&quot; but catches himself in mid-sentence.<br /><br />&quot;He hides in caves while sending young people off to die.&quot;<br /><br />Visit MugsysRapSheet.com{% endraw %}
