The film features a nice mix of footage where the pros are seen both attending to the common faults of some everyday golfers and demonstrating their techniques on the course.  Included in the film are the giants of the game at the time:  Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Lloyd Mangrum, Jerry Barber, Cary Middlecoff, Walter Burkemo, Ed Oliver, Jimmy Demaret, Lawson Little, Byron Nelson, Lew Worsham, Pat Abbott, Miss Louise Suggs, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.<br /><br />When most of us think of 1953 we think of Hogan's most dominant year and the footage in this feature proves why.  His swing was really in top form and we get a nice shot of him driving the ball and then approaching with a short wedge of about 70 yards.  He plunks it 2 inches from the cup.  Here's a couple small clips I pulled from the film.<br /><br />I love the camera work on the approach shot.  They just set the camera behind the green and line up Ben and the flagstick, zooming in on a 10 foot circle around the cup.  Of course the ball plops in right where everyone knew it would.<br /><br />But there is a ton of other great stuff in this video besides Hogan.  My favorite part is the chunk where several golfers are shown swinging on the grid background.  Awesome to see Louise Suggs slinging a persimmon around or Lloyd Mangrum with his super narrow stance.  So many homemade swings and legendary golfers.{% endraw %}
