{% raw %}In this video, Ask This Old House master electrician Heath Eastman installs recessed lights in a homeowner’s playroom.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to This Old House: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubscribeThisOldHouse.">http://bit.ly/SubscribeThisOldHouse.</a><br /><br />Heath heads to a homeowner's house to help her with a dimly lit room. The homeowner explains that she has recessed lights in some of her rooms, but the children's playroom is lit only with a lamp. Heath knows just what to do, offering recessed lighting in the playroom to match the other areas in the home. After accessing the layout of the framing and the plumbing in the ceiling, Heath gets to work. After ensuring that the power is off, Heath rewires a switch-controlled outlet so that it's on constant power. Then, after removing the switch, Heath can look into the wall cavity to ensure that it's free of obstruction. Next, Heath drills holes in the ceiling for recessed lights (utilizing the dust shroud for mess control) and inside the wall for wiring. With the homeowner's help, Heath pulls wires for the new lights through the ceiling and back to the switch location before wiring the individual devices. Then, back at the switch, Heath installs a dimmer switch to control the room's brightness.<br /><br />Skill: ⅗<br />Cost: Under $300 (depending on the light and number)<br />Estimated Time: 3 Hours<br /><br />Shopping list:<br />Outlet [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3nyrWMn]">https://amzn.to/3nyrWMn]</a><br />Various wire nuts [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jHiKEm]">https://amzn.to/3jHiKEm]</a><br />Electrical boxes [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2XVBBUs]">https://amzn.to/2XVBBUs]</a><br />Recessed lights [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jG7jfU]">https://amzn.to/3jG7jfU]</a><br />Wire [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZsTAT2]">https://amzn.to/2ZsTAT2]</a><br />Dimmable light switch [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZDNW09]">https://amzn.to/2ZDNW09]</a><br />Wall plate for the switch [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jHzPxS]">https://amzn.to/3jHzPxS]</a><br /><br />Tools:<br />Non-contact voltage tester [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3mhZf6K]">https://amzn.to/3mhZf6K]</a><br />Drill [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3nD8IFl]">https://amzn.to/3nD8IFl]</a><br />Keyhole saw [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Gqly2j]">https://amzn.to/3Gqly2j]</a><br />4 ⅜ or 6 ⅜-inch hole saw [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3EnQaQ0]">https://amzn.to/3EnQaQ0]</a> (depending on the lights)<br />Fish tape [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vNZQjG]">https://amzn.to/3vNZQjG]</a><br />Screwdriver [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CgtK2B]">https://amzn.to/3CgtK2B]</a><br />Linesman’s pliers [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3EqLfxX]">https://amzn.to/3EqLfxX]</a><br />Flexible drill bit [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3mmM5pj]">https://amzn.to/3mmM5pj]</a><br />Wire strippers [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vQi8ki]">https://amzn.to/3vQi8ki]</a><br /><br />Where to find it?<br />Heath installed HALO brand HLBSL 4 in.
