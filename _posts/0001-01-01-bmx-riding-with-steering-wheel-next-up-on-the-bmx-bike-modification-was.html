{% raw %}Next up on the BMX bike modification was to put a BMW 3 series steering wheel as a handlebar and try do tricks on it! Definitely one of my more successful Bmx modifications as I was actually able to do tricks, grinds, and even a barspin.<br />THANKS FOR WATCHING!<br />MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://olabmxshop.myshopify.com">https://olabmxshop.myshopify.com</a><br /><br />Get a BMX bike here: www.mafiabike.com<br /><br />Get a Mini BMX here: www.rockerbmx.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/olabmx">http://instagram.com/olabmx</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/OlaSelsjord">https://www.facebook.com/OlaSelsjord</a>{% endraw %}
