{% raw %}Introducing the new VW Taigo R-Line 1.5 TSI 2022.<br /><br />The VW Taigo 2022 is a SUV coupe and is based on Volkswagen Nivus SUV but the brand has technologically adapted the car for Europe, equipping it with a much more advanced kit and adding a Europe-only R-Line trim to the line-up.<br /><br />The 1-litre TSI three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine will be offered in 95 hp and 110 hp forms. The 1st one will be linked to a five-speed manual transmission and the latter to a six-speed manual or to a seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic.<br /><br />The 95 hp model can launch from 0 to 62mph in 11.1 seconds, going on to a top speed of 114mph.<br /><br />The 110 hp unit cuts the 0 to 62mph time to 10.4 seconds, or 10.9 seconds when equipped with the dual-clutch gearbox, and top speed is 119mph for either option.<br /><br />The most potent engine option will be a 1.5 TSI four-cylinder turbo unit, producing 150 hp and will be paired exclusively with the seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox. It reaches 62mph in 8.3 seconds and maximum speed is 132mph.<br /><br />The Sportier Taigo R Line versions add larger 17-inch alloy wheels, tinted rear windows, and new front and rear bumpers. Inside, you’ll spot R badging, black roof lining and a new R Line steering wheel, along with dual-zone climate control, a larger 10.25-inch digital driver’s display and an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, with built-in sat-nav. It supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay with the full-whack adding wireless smartphone mirroring.<br /><br />The Taigo will also feature IQ Drive Travel Assist semi-autonomous adaptive cruise control, which keeps the car at a set distance from the vehicle in front, and in its lane on the motorway at up to 130mph.<br /><br />The price for the Taigo R Line version starts at €28000, in Europe.<br /><br />----------‐-----------‐-------------------------------------------<br /><br />Contact us: rec.anything.2019@gmail.com<br /><br />Join us on Youtube:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/recanything">https://youtube.com/c/recanything</a><br /><br />You can follow us on FACEBOOK: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RecAnythingOfficial">https://www.facebook.com/RecAnythingOfficial</a><br /><br />You can follow us on INSTAGRAM: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rec.anything">https://www.instagram.com/rec.anything</a><br /><br />----------‐-----------‐-------------------------------------------{% endraw %}
