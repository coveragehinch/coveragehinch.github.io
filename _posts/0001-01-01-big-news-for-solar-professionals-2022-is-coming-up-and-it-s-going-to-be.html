We have gathered many years‚Äô worth of information from homeowners living in over 25 states. We have spent millions online collecting this data to use in our solar campaigns to be able to bring our solar clients ‚Äúcredit qualified‚Äù homeowners who have a high interest in your pipeline.<br /><br />Instead of running generic solar ads that people have been exposed to for years and have become immune towards we use solar offers that go hand in hand with the concept of solar and have a much better chance of competing and even winning over solar companies with 6-7 figures monthly marketing budgets.<br /><br />We use the solar funnel instead of a simple ‚ÄúFacebook lead form ad‚Äù to further educate and entice homeowners interested in going solar to go through the process of giving us their personal information so they can be contacted.<br /><br />Our application process is designed to collect homeowners information who are interested in going solar and filter out the ones who aren‚Äôt homeowners and have below-average credit score or in other words people who don‚Äôt fit the criteria of being eligible for solar.<br /><br />As the successful leads meet our requirements, they are then encouraged to schedule an appointment on your calendar at a time of their convenience. This automation process means that instead of chasing unqualified, discarded leads, you can spend your time with trained and motivated buyers.<br /><br />This is where we continue to educate and inform the homeowners who have expressed interest in switching to solar using SMS and email sequences. The main purpose for nurturing of the solar leads is to make sure your company stays top of mind even long after your prospects have gone through the application process.<br /><br />Don‚Äôt let amateurs run your ads.
