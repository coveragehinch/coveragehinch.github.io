But the beauty therapy student wants people to know: “I’m not racist., I just really like having a tan.” Hannah, 22, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, is Caucasian but became addicted to tanning when she got an “amazing tan” on holiday in Turkey in 2015. A photo from the trip shows how she completely changed colour from her natural white to a dark brown. But her remarkable colour isn’t just down to the sun. Hannah uses under-the-counter tanning injections of a substance called Melanotan, which users take to go darker more quickly under sunlight or sun beds. And while Hannah admits she is at the “extreme end’, she says she is part of a growing trend in tanning in Belfast, with many using the illegal drug.<br /><br />Video Credits:<br />Videographer / director: Sam Jones<br />Producer: Liam Miller, Ruby Coote<br />Editor: Florence Kennard<br /><br />Barcroft TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured</a><br />Barcroft Animals: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured">https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a><br /><br />For more of the amazing side of life:<br /><br />For the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.barcroft.tv/">http://www.barcroft.tv/</a><br />Like @BarcroftTV on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftTV">https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftTV</a><br />Follow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV">https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV</a><br />Check out more videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos</a><br /><br />Download Barcroft TV on iOS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8</a><br /><br />Download Barcroft TV on Android: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&amp;hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&amp;hl=en</a>{% endraw %}
