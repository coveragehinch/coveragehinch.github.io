This is my channel Onn Rathy mostly talking about Cambodia's social and political issues and it offers Cambodian people careful analytical thinking on Cambodian politicians.  For me, it doesn’t matter how hard I work for helping Cambodian people —It is necessary for making people take a clear and right decision on their own on the political and social realities. In fact, the general view in society is making people have a lot of confused ideas.<br /><br />My goal is to make Cambodian people understand Cambodia’s social and political issues and shares new ideas for them in order to be away from being cheated by dishonest politicians just because Cambodia needs honest and respectful politicians, having clear intentions. Cambodian people do not need people who cheat them.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, there are two well-known politicians: Hun Sen, the Cambodian Prime Minister, and the ruling party leader, and Sam Sam, Cambodia’s most prominent opposition leader. <br /><br />There are also other well-known analysts and politicians talking about the social &amp; political: MR KEM SOKHA, MR SARETH SOUK, MR  KHEM VEASNA, MR PICH SROS, MR WILLIAM GUANG, MR PHENG VANNAK, MR JAMES SOK, MR SAN BUNTHOEUN, MR KIM SOK, MR SO NARO, DR SENG SARY, MR MAK HOEUN, MR LONG SOKUNTHEARAK, HEM CHANTHA, MR KRISNA LIM, MR THAL SAVUTH.<br /><br />In particular, it also provides you the English knowledge of English Khmer, Khmer English, Translation News/newspaper, Writing tips, Grammar study, Vocabulary. These are useful for Cambodian people to learn English easily on YouTube Channel Onn Rathy.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for your coming, supporting, and watching my governmental, political, and social videos talking about the current situations of Cambodia. Finally, I do hope that everything goes smoothly and provides a number of useful videos for you. Thanks!!!<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />#OnnRathy{% endraw %}
