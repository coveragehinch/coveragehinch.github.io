{% raw %}Dr. Andrew Huberman came on the Mark Bells Power Project and gave me 2 supplement suggestions to try and use to increase my testosterone. I decided to test them out to see if they would have any affect and they did!<br /><br />I got my bloodwork tested from Marek Health on 09/17 and retested it on 11/09. The results in the video show a solid increase in Testosterone and a change in other metrics related to testosterone production.<br /><br />Fadogia Agrestis: shorturl.at/nuR78<br /><br />Tongkat Ali: shorturl.at/mpHRV<br /><br />Save on your labs from Marek Health<br />Marek health.com/powerproject<br />Use code “PowerProject10” at checkout for 10% off all labs!<br /><br />Here's the Power Project Episode with Huberman! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xyCKKeNcmVo">https://youtu.be/xyCKKeNcmVo</a><br />Clip of Huberman Talking about these supplements <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2PSbFBWyRK8">https://youtu.be/2PSbFBWyRK8</a><br /><br />Time Stamps:<br />00:00 - Preview<br />0:24 - Intro<br />01:47 - Increasing your testosterone without supplements<br />02:44 - Marek Health Discount and my Labwork Process<br />03:58 - Which specific supplements did I take? <br />04:57 - What I felt after beginning to take these supplements<br />06:26 - Review of my bloodwork from Marek Health<br />08:30 - Conclusion and takeaways{% endraw %}
