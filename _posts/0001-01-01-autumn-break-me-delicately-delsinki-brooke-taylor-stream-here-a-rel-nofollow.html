The pair have creatively mirrored this against the 4 seasons (beginning in Spring and ending in winter).<br />Over the last few years both DELSINKI and Brooke Taylor have played a myraid of shows across many platforms, including touring with the Australian Chamber Orchestra, finalists in the Telstra Road to discovery, and set to tour for the remainder of 2016 across the East Coast.<br /><br />Love One is a haunting and uplifting amalgamation of melody, instrumentation, excitement, anticipation, anxiety and heartbreak. These themes and feelings can be related to by each audience member, and as such, ‘Love One’ will have something to give (and possibly take away) from everyone.{% endraw %}
