{% raw %}Ships in Chinese seas have vanished from industry tracking systems, adding to the global supply chain's problems. China's growing isolation from the rest of the world, along with a rising aversion to foreign influence, could be to blame.<br />According to analysts, the drop-off in shipping traffic began at the end of October, as China prepared to pass data privacy legislation.<br />Because ships are equipped with an Automatic Identification System, or AIS, transceiver, shipping data providers can usually track them all over the world.<br />This system uses high-frequency radio to let ships to communicate information such as position, speed, course, and name to stations located along coastlines. Information can be exchanged by satellite if a ship is out of range of those stations.<br />However, this is not the case in China, the world's second-largest economy and a key player in global trade. According to statistics from worldwide shipping data service VesselsValue, the number of vessels sending signals from the country has dropped by about 90% in the last three weeks.<br />&quot;We're witnessing an industry-wide decline in terrestrial AIS signals in China right now,&quot; said Charlotte Cook, VesselsValue's lead trade analyst.<br />However, this is not the case in China, the world's second-largest economy and a key player in global trade.

The State Council Information Office, which serves as the country's cabinet's press office, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why shipping companies were losing data access.<br /><br />IMPORTANT!<br /> -None of these images, music &amp; video clips were created/owned by us. -This video is purely fan-made, if you (owners) have seen your content and want to remove this video, please message us privately or mail us before doing anything.
