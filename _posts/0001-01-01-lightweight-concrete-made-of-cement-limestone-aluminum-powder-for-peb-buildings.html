{% raw %}Non autoclaved lightweight aerated concrete recipe you can find here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pioner-group.com/concrete/">http://www.pioner-group.com/concrete/</a> <br /><br /><br />Combination of light gauge steel frame with non autoclaved lightweight aerated concrete insulation <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pioner-group.com/technology/">http://www.pioner-group.com/technology/</a><br /><br />Non autoclaved lightweight aerated concrete is a type of lightweight concrete which is used to produce blocks and replace bricks. NAAC is lighter then conventional concrete. It is formed by using portland cement, fly ash, limestone, aluminum powder and water. Aerated concrete has a good strength, durability, good thermal and sound insulation. Dry density of this material ranging between 600 kg/m3 to 1600 kg/m3. Non autoclaved lightweight concrete blocks can be used for housing and commercial purposes. <br /><br />We have developed a unique non autoclave lightweight aerated concrete recipe and can achieve densities from 250 kg/m2 (even less) with perfect compressive strength, thermal and sound insulation. <br /><br /><br />PIONER GROUP supply lightweight aerated concrete infill for cold formed steel construction technology infill and we can supply dry mortars (plaster, floor screed, self leveling compound, lightweight aerated concrete dry mix etc.) production line with a good price and speed of delivery.<br /><br />Cold formed steel, also known as light gauge steel or LGS, is deployed worldwide for structural framing, in buildings of all sizes and purposes. These include multi-story projects, meeting engineering compliance to local design and building codes and to last as long as any building erected using traditional materials. <br /><br /><br />There is a misconception by some that cold formed steel (CFS) should only be used for interior framing or non-structural building elements - but thatâ€™s not the full extent of its capabilities.<br />Far from it. CFS delivers many advantages in the construction of structural, load bearing walls as well.<br /><br />Cold formed steel, also known as light gauge steel or LGS, is deployed worldwide for structural framing, in buildings of all sizes and purposes. These include multi-story projects, meeting engineering compliance to local design and building codes and to last as long as any building erected using traditional materials.<br /><br /><br />Because CFS, with the help of technical software (like, FRAMECAD STRUCTURE), can be engineered and designed to be load-bearing, and because of its unique physical characteristics, CFS makes for a superior structural framing material.{% endraw %}
