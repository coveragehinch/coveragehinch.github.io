Each child is different, so follow these meal plans at your discretion. You can modify the meals according to your child's preferences and requirements.  <br /> 2. Introduce only one fruit or vegetable to your baby at a time and feed it for at least three days. If there are no signs of an allergy, you can continue the same.  <br />3. If your baby has an allergic reaction, stop that food immediately. In case the allergic reaction persists, consult a paediatrician.  <br />4. If your child has a known food allergy to nuts, gluten, eggs, etc., please consult your doctor before following the suggested diet plan.  <br />5. Do not feed honey to babies under 12 months of age, as it may contain bacterial spores that cause infant botulism.<br />6. Do not feed cow’s milk to babies under 12 months of age as they may develop lactose-intolerance.<br />7. Don’t stop breastfeeding at once. Breastfeed on demand or in-between meals.<br />8. Offer mashed and pureed food after between 6-8 months, slowly progressing to lumpy and finely-chopped food.<br />9. Offer chopped and finger foods between 8-12 months to encourage self-feeding.<br />10. Offer regular food with a variety of tastes and textures after 12 months.<br />11. While preparing formula, please follow the instructions on the box and use the measuring spoon  provided with it.<br />12. Don’t stop solid foods if your child is suffering from diarrhoea.  <br /> 13. Some kids may eat less on some days, which is alright. However, if your child eats less for more than 3-4 consecutive days, consult your doctor.  <br />14. A child may eat less if he is teething or ill. Increase breast milk /formula feeds on those days and re-introduce solids once the child is back to normal.{% endraw %}
