{% raw %}Police are increasingly focusing on disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh in the shocking murders of his wife and son. A “48 Hours” investigation is shedding new light on the mystery. 53-year-old Murdaugh is at the center of a web of tragic deaths that has ensnared the once-powerful dynasty family. One theory is that the murders of his wife and son were linked to his son’s role in the death of 19-year-old Mallory Beach in a 2019 boating accident.{% endraw %}
