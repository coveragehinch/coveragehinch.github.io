I'm Rebecca from engVid. There are really only two ways to improve your English: Go forward and learn what's right, and go back and correct what's wrong. In this lesson we're going to do a little bit of both. We're going to look at 10 confusing words and see if you know the difference. Sometimes it's a different word form, sometimes it's actually a different verb altogether, or a different word. So, let's look at these. They are confused very often, so stick with me and you'll understand the difference. Let's get started.<br /><br />The first one: &quot;How can I succeed?&quot; or &quot;How can I success?&quot; So obviously the pair we're talking about here is &quot;succeed&quot; and &quot;success&quot;. So, what is correct in number one? &quot;How can I succeed?&quot; or &quot;How can I success?&quot; The answer is: &quot;succeed&quot;. Okay? All right.<br /><br />Number two: &quot;How can I achieve succeed?&quot; or &quot;How can I achieve success?&quot; What's the right answer? Do you know? I hope so. It is: &quot;How can I achieve success?&quot; All right? So, what happened here? Well, &quot;succeed&quot; is the verb. All right? And &quot;success&quot; is the noun. That's a really important difference. Thousands and thousands of students, probably millions make a mistake with these two words. So make sure you are not one of those. All right? Let's go on.<br /><br />Number three: &quot;Smoking affected her health.&quot; or &quot;Smoking effected her health.&quot; All right? I hope you can hear the difference in pronunciation and also in spelling. So, what's the correct answer here? &quot;Smoking affected her health.&quot; or &quot;...effected her health.&quot;? It should be: &quot;Smoking affected her health.&quot; Very good.<br /><br />And number four: &quot;Smoking had a bad affect on her.&quot; or &quot;Smoking had a bad effect on her.&quot;? What's the difference? Well, it should be: &quot;Smoking had a bad effect on her.&quot; So the two words we were looking at here were &quot;affect&quot; and &quot;effect&quot;. And which one is the verb? &quot;Affect&quot; is the verb and &quot;effect&quot; is a noun. All right? Good.<br /><br />Number five: &quot;Could you give me some advise?&quot; or &quot;Could you give me some advice?&quot; What's the correct word there? &quot;Could you give me some advice?&quot; Okay? Good.<br /><br />And number six: &quot;Could you advise me?&quot; or &quot;Could you advice me?&quot; Which is correct? It should be: &quot;Could you advise me?&quot; Two words here: &quot;advise&quot; and &quot;advice&quot;. &quot;Advise&quot; is the verb, and &quot;advice&quot; is the noun. Now, also, &quot;advice&quot; is a non-count noun, so we cannot say: &quot;advices&quot;. All right? Sometimes people say: &quot;advice&quot;, but then they make it &quot;advices&quot;. That's not correct. You can't say that. So, &quot;advise&quot; which is spelt with an &quot;s&quot; but sounds like a &quot;z&quot;, and &quot;advice&quot; which is the noun. Now, don't worry. If you got any of these wrong we have actually detailed lessons on each of these points which I will refer you to afterwards. Okay? Stick with me.<br /><br />Number seven: &quot;We will choice the new Prime Minister (PM).&quot; or &quot;We will choose the new Prime Minister.&quot;? What do you think it should be? &quot;We will choose the new Prime Minister.&quot; Okay? Good.<br /><br />&quot;He was our first choice.&quot; or &quot;He was our first choose.&quot; Which one is it? Can you tell? &quot;He was our first choice.&quot; Okay? So, here again, &quot;choose&quot; is the verb and &quot;choice&quot; is the noun. Okay? We made a choice, but we chose him. &quot;Choose&quot; in the past becomes &quot;chose&quot;. All right? &quot;Choose&quot;, &quot;chose&quot;, &quot;choice&quot;, you have to work with them-all right?-to really master those words.<br /><br />And the last one: &quot;They emigrated to Canada.&quot; or &quot;They immigrated to Canada.&quot;? Which one is it? This one is confused a lot, and actually one of our other engVid teachers, Emma, has done a great one on this one. So if you're confused, I'm going to tell you where you can find her lesson, too. So: &quot;They emigrated to Canada.&quot; or &quot;They immigrated to Canada.&quot;? Well, it should be: &quot;They immigrated to Canada.&quot; Okay?<br /><br />And number 10: &quot;They emigrated from Mexico.&quot; or &quot;They immigrated from Mexico.&quot;? Okay? This time you have both verbs. Right? So if that was &quot;immigrated&quot;, this one is actually &quot;emigrated&quot;. &quot;They emigrated from Mexico.&quot; Now, here, it's not a question. They're both verbs. Okay? &quot;Emigrate&quot; is a verb and &quot;immigrate&quot; is a verb, but what's the difference? You see that you immigrate to a place, but you emigrate from somewhere else. All right?{% endraw %}
