Hamish's YouTube channel took off when a video of him giving himself a bowl cut went viral. Tune in as they discuss Hamish's recovery from a partying lifestyle of addiction to alcohol and drugs, and the ups and downs of his journey since becoming sober: from having his house burn down completely, to separating from his wife for a time. They also discuss the critical importance of actively engaging in your local government and beyond, in order to preserve our freedoms.
