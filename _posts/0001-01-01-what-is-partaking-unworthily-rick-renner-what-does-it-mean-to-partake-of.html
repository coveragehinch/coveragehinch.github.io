To order the series and book offers click SHOW MORE.<br /><br />Many churches have “Communion” once every quarter of the year. But what is it really all about? In this series, Rick delves into what Communion meant in the ancient world and why Jesus commanded all Christians to practice it. People all over the world — and in every Christian denomination — often take Communion without really understanding what it means. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://renner.org/product/insights-on-communion-5-part-series/">https://renner.org/product/insights-on-communion-5-part-series/</a><br /><br />Shame is a prison that fetters the mind as surely and securely as any chain could bind the body — but Jesus Christ died to loose the bonds of sin and set the captives free! In her book, Redeemed From Shame, Denise Renner shares the liberating truth that regardless of whatever hurt, pain, lies, or disappointment have produced shame in your life, you can be set free from the prison of shame once and for all. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://renner.org/product/redeemed-from-shame/">https://renner.org/product/redeemed-from-shame/</a><br /><br /><br />#Bible #RickRenner #Covenant #Communion{% endraw %}
