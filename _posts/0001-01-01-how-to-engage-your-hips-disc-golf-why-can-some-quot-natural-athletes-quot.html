{% raw %}Why can some &quot;natural athletes&quot; throw farther after a few months of playing than most can in their whole career? This video is demystifying the myth around throwing far and shows you how to engage your hips - disc golf. üò§<br /><br />Your hips are two of the strongest muscles in your body, and just a little bit of influence from your hips can result in HUGE added distance to your throw. But there's a reason that most amateur players haven't learned to use their hips in their throw, and that is because most of the instruction out there covers the upper body more so than the lower. After watching this video, you'll see not only WHY the hips being engaged results in a much stronger throw but HOW to engage the hips next time you go out to do fieldwork. <br /><br />If you like throwing far, shooting low, and supporting a fellow disc golfer trying to make his dream of going pro a reality, SUBSCRIBE to the channel, and follow along for more of Ben's Big Drive üò§ü•è<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bensbigdrive/">https://www.instagram.com/bensbigdrive/</a>{% endraw %}
