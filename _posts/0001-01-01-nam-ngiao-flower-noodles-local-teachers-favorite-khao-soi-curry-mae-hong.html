{% raw %}Shan Noodles (&quot;Ngiew Flower&quot; Noodles) are a delicious treat to look for when you are in the North of Thailand.  A dish that features several unique items, each of which bring a strong flavor to this 'Tai-Yai' (Shan) favorite; the dried sour/stinky bean 'cakes,' the dried-and-then-fried 'Ngiew' flowers, the soft and silky blood cake (sometimes pork, sometimes chicken blood), and last but definitely not least are the tomatoes.<br /><br />This dish is amazing and it is THIS dish I want to introduce to you today.  'Khao Soi' of course is a classic, a favorite, a beautiful dish that does have its own roots right here in Northern Thailand (it doesn't come from here exactly, but eating it the way you see in this video today IS the local way and therefore, Chiang Mai can lay claim to the coconut-cream version of this dish).<br /><br />So whenever you do have the chance to make your way up north, don't forget to keep your eyes open for &quot;Nam Ngiao&quot; Shan Noodles.  Chiang Ria, Mae Hong Son, and of course Chiang Mai, all 3 famous Northern provinces have their own love for this dish, and all 3 of these are places where people of Tai Yai descent make their homes.<br /><br />Have a beautiful day everyone, and thank you so much for hanging with us, for commenting on this video, and for really getting into the whole &quot;Mae Hong Son Loop&quot; trip with Li and myself.  This is video #6, and remember, the next two videos coming up are extremely unique (first experience like this for me, ever, not just in Thailand but in my life!) so I hope you love those as well :). Full playlist link down below, and let me wish you a wonderful day today.  Be well!  Much love.<br />-Joel<br /><br />LOCATION:<br />Nam Ngiao Chiang Rai<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/iz1srZLEcNqQjCRY8">https://goo.gl/maps/iz1srZLEcNqQjCRY8</a><br /><br />COST OF THE MEAL:<br />85 Baht for our 2 bowls of Noodles and 1 bag of Pork Cracklings<br />(although some might argue that the cracklings are a necessary<br />part of this dish to begin with, which again are &quot;Kaep Moo&quot; in Thai :)<br /><br />FULL PLAYLIST of the Mae Hong Son Loop:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_Facbg0apPHFRARLvB3I3tY8w3gl-2u4">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_Facbg0apPHFRARLvB3I3tY8w3gl-2u4</a>{% endraw %}
