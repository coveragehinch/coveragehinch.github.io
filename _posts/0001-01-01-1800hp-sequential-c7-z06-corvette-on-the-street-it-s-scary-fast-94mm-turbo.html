{% raw %}On this episode we feature one of the baddest street Corvettes we've seen on the channel! Matt's 2015 C7 Z06 is fitted with a Dart Block 427, 94MM turbo, Sequential Transmission, and Motec M150! It's made upwards of 1600whp on the dyno and makes around 1800whp on 40PSI. He takes us for a ride on his schmedium boost setting, needless to say this car is absolutely insane!<br /><br />TRC Race Event Schedule:<br />TRC Street Kings Annual event - Bradenton Motorsports Park - Dec 11th<br />TX2K22 - March 16th - 20th - Houston Raceway Park{% endraw %}
