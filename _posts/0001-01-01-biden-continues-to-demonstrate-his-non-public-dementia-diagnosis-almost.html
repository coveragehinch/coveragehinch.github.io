{% raw %}Sky News host Cory Bernardi says US President Joe Biden &quot;continues to demonstrate his non-public dementia diagnosis almost every day&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;The state of US politics is no laughing matter but unless you are prepared to laugh at it, you'd probably start to cry,&quot; he said.<br /><br />&quot;The game is so stacked with buffoons, questionable ethics, shameless grifters, and the walking dead that it is like a really bad soap opera.<br /><br />&quot;House Speaker, the cadaverous Nancy Pelosi has a husband with an uncanny knack of nailing big stock market winners.<br /> <br />&quot;Just another day in American politics apparently â€¦ nothing to see here.&quot;{% endraw %}
