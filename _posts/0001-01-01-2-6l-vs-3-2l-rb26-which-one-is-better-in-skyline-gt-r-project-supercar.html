{% raw %}Our R32 Skyline GT-R is back! In this episode of Motive Garage we compare a 2.6L to a  3.2L engine package. All of the support gear and external parts are the same, all that has changed is the RB30 block with Nitto 3.2L stroker kit and slightly larger camshafts to suit increased capacity. Finally some REAL data and results on the effect of increased capacity on a RB. <br /><br />Get your Motive Video merchandise here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://motive.bigcartel.com/">https://motive.bigcartel.com/</a><br />Get the GT-R parts we recommend here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gtrhub.bigcartel.com/">https://gtrhub.bigcartel.com/</a><br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Motivevideo">https://www.facebook.com/Motivevideo</a><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/motive_video/">https://www.instagram.com/motive_video/</a><br /><br />Sparesbox website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sparesbox.com.au/">https://www.sparesbox.com.au/</a> <br />Motive Discount Code: MOTIVE5<br /><br />Motive Video creates content on modified performance cars, focussing on Japanese cars, but also European and hi-tech V8s.
