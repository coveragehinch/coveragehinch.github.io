{% raw %}Toton Yard &amp; Sheds in Nottinghamshire were once one of the largest in Europe.<br /><br />Now it is a sorry shadow of what once was, surrounded by reminders and scars of a once bustling leader of the rail industry to a small bit part player in our depleated rail network.<br /><br />In this video i walk the outskirts of the yard, taking a look at parts of this former yard and see if anything remians or possible reminders of its history.<br /><br />Starting at the former Meadow Sidings and working my way around the Southern section before heading up towards the New &amp; Old Bank Sidings.<br /><br />All on screen text regarding the &quot; West Yard &quot; should also include the &quot; East Yard &quot;<br /><br />Plenty of nostalgic images thanks to Paul Robertson, David Ford, David Blower &amp; The Gang of 3.<br /><br />Drone footage by Mavic Air 2<br /><br />Subscribe here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6BAVDccOWUt16LFzdv0LA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6BAVDccOWUt16LFzdv0LA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Would you like to help support my Channel?
