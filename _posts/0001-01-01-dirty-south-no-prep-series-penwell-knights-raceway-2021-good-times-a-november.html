{% raw %}November 5-6, 2021 at Penwell Knights Raceway in Odessa, Texas for Dirty South No Prep Series.<br /><br />We finally got our first win with the new car.  We fought the car getting down the track making grudge passes on Friday night and foregoing the Cash Days. We did that in order to focus on making adjustments to make the car competitive for Saturday.  Ended up not liking what the data was showing in regards to the transmission, so we decided to make a last minute transmission change on Saturday morning (Thanks Finney!).<br /><br />I have to thank my wife, crew and sponsors for this win.  I couldn't have done it without you.  This car has fought us since day 1, but I promise you we will figure it out before next season.<br /><br />Follow us on social media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/scotttaylormotorsports">https://www.facebook.com/scotttaylormotorsports</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/scotttaylormotorsports">https://www.instagram.com/scotttaylormotorsports</a><br /><br />Check out our website and pick out some STM merch:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scotttaylormotorsports.com">https://www.scotttaylormotorsports.com</a>{% endraw %}
