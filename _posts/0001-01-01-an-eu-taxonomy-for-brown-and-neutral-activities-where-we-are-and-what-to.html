{% raw %}In the session, panellists will focus on the particular issues arising from brown and neutral activities. The EU is considering whether, as part of its transition strategy, the EU should develop a brown and/or neutral taxonomy that sits next to the other taxonomies. How would such a set of taxonomies be designed and how would they relate to the ongoing work on green taxonomies? What would be the policy implications of developing and using such brown and neutral taxonomies? Would this for example lead to higher regulatory capital charges for financing these activities? How should brown activities be treated that otherwise might benefit society? Most importantly, will a brown taxonomy accelerate the emergence of legacy issues and what would be the implications for asset class prices and the long-term re-shifting of portfolios? What could be the implications for future public funding of projects, the impact on investment and R&amp;D in different economic sectors?<br /><br />Panellists:<br /><br />- Andreas Barkman, Member of the Platform on Sustainable Finance, Subgroup on negative and low-impact activities and Senior Expert on Sustainable Finance, European Environment Agency<br />- Nathalie Dogniez, Partner, Asset and Wealth Management EMEA, PwC<br />- Kevin Bourne, Managing Director and Head of Sustainable Finance, IHS Markit<br />- Sir Jonathan Taylor, Senior Advisor, Afore Consulting<br /><br />Moderator: Nickolas Reinhardt, Director, Afore Consulting{% endraw %}
