Comment, like, share this story.<br /><br />It was 6th grade and time for the Valentines Day dance. Izzy and a group of her friends decided they would all go to the dance together. In this group were three of Izzy's girlfriends and two of her guy friends.  No one was dating - it was just a group of friends going to the dance together.<br /><br />They were having fun at the dance - dancing, eating, watching movies - no drama. But when the boys go off to the snack table, and leave Izzy with her three girl friends, things start to get a little uncomfortable.<br /><br />The girls ask Izzy who she had a crush on. Izzy , as it turns out, was crushing on one of the guy friends in her group - Jack - she almost even asked him to the dance but chickened out at the last minute.  She even had a note, a love note, she wrote to ask him to the dance but she never gave it to him. This was her little secret that she wanted to keep all to herself. But the girls kept pushing and pushing and pushing until Izzy finally gave in and revealed to them that she had a big crush on Jack. He'd be a great boyfriend and she was crazy about him. <br /><br />One of Izzy's friend's, Yvonna, with a look of mischief in her eyes, immediately ran off towards Jack. Izzy was totally freaked out because she knew what Yvonna is going to do - tell Jack that Izzy had a crush on him. There was no way that Izzy was going to let that happen so she ran over to her  as fast as she could and knocked Yvonna to the ground before she could tell Jack that Izzy liked him.<br /><br />Well she made it in time and dragged Yvonna back, and screamed at her to never do anything like that again. Well, Yvonna was too mischievous to listen to that demand. She slipped away once again and this time - told Jack Izzy had a crush on him...a Valentines Day Crush and she wanted him to be her valentine. <br /><br />Izzy, as you can imagine was super mad. Her friends denied it, saying that they told Jack it was just a prank. Izzy didn't know what to believe - did Jack think she liked him or did he believe it was just a prank?<br /><br />She never found out but she did get to have a slow dance, a Valentines Day dance with Jack, so maybe the fact that Yvonna shared her little secret wasn't such a bad thing after all. Valentine's Day turned out a little better than Izzy expected or hoped. <br /><br />We love this true story.
