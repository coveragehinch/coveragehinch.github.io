{% raw %}In this episode, we unbox and test out the Retro-bit Super Retro Trio 3+, which has been updated with a new controller for 2021 &amp; beyond.<br /><br />It is amazing how easy it can now be to play your retro NES, Super NES, or Genesis games in crisp HDMI. Retro-bit was one of the first companies to release an HDMI-equipped NES with their RES+, and they followed that up with their 3-in1 Super Retro Trio 3+. Designed to play NES, SNES, Super Famicom, Genesis, &amp; Mega Drive games in 720P HD, in 2021 Retro-but updated the console with new controllers that more closely mimic the original SNES' design. They were kind enough to send me one of these units to review, which is what you see here.<br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 - Introduction<br />2:38 - Unboxing<br />5:29 - Comparisons to original SRT3+<br />6:51 - New Controller Overview<br />7:45 - Aspect Ratio<br />8:12 - Super Mario Bros<br />10:09 - Battletoads<br />11:41 - Darkwing Duck (PAL)<br />12:28 - Parodius Da (Famicom w/60 to 72 pin adapter)<br />14:02 - Earthworm Jim (PAL Super Nintendo)<br />16:17 - SNES Game Genie<br />16:28 - Super Mario World<br />17:53 - Ducktales 2 (Super Game Boy)<br />19:11 - Donkey Kong (Super Game Boy)<br />20:29 - Zero Wing<br />21:50 - Grand Slam Masters (Mega Drive)<br />22:09 - Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles<br />24:00 - Virtua Racing<br />24:26 - Initial Thoughts<br />26:19 - Where to buy<br /><br />Having tested the original SRT3+ many years ago, I had a pretty good idea of what to expect. Now, I was hoping that, in addition to the update to the controller, there would be an update to the system. I really hoped that they would address the lack of an aspect ratio switch and the reverse duty cycle issues on the NES Side. Unfortunately, neither of these things were addressed as it appears that the console itself is identical to the originally released version. That's a bummer.<br /><br />The major change here is, indeed, the new controller. Gone is the controller that was also in the Super Retrocade (a controller I actually really liked), replaced with one that more closely mimics the original Super Nintendo controller. I say Super NES and not Super Famicom because this still features the concave/convex button configuration which I greatly prefer. To connect to the system, the controller includes a 10' long cord, more than enough for most applications. In all, the new controller is comfortable, responsive, and it just works. <br /><br />Gameplay:<br />One thing I didn't point out in the video is that there is, actually, a region switch on the front of the unit, close to where the controller ports are. This is mostly for the NES side of things but slows down those 50HZ PAL titles so they play properly on US 60HZ TVs. On games like Darkwing Duck, however, I just can't play at &quot;regular&quot; speed, I've gotten so accustomed to the sped up versions!<br /><br />Why It RoX:<br />- Plays SNES, SFC, NES, Mega Drive &amp; Genesis Games<br />- Long Controller Cord<br />- 720P HDMI output<br />- AV Out for those who want it<br />- Nice Controller Update<br />- Hardware, not software driven<br /><br />What could be improved:<br />- No aspect ratio switch<br />- Super Game Boy sounded overdriven<br />- Virtua Racing doesn't work<br />- Include a 60 to 72 Pin Adapter for Famicom Games<br /><br />Should You Buy One?<br />Overall, the 2021 version of the Super Retro Trio 3+ is, largely, unchanged from the original model. the main change is, in fact, that controller redesign, and that's a nice change. Retro-bit had a chance to go back and address some of the issues with the original system, and unfortunately, the console itself hasn't been changed at all. The lack of an aspect ratio switch is practically unforgivable at this point. Thankfully if your TV is like mine, you can change the aspect ratio on your television instead, but that doesn't change the output file for streaming or capturing. The overmodulated Super Game Boy Audio was also a bit disappointing. There's a lot of potential here, I am just hoping for something even better from Retro-bit in the future.<br /><br />#RetroBit  #SuperRetroTrio3+ #VideoGames #NES #NESHD #SNES #Genesis<br /><br />The footage used in this review are used under the Fair Use laws, referenced below:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107</a><br /> <br />Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. <br /> <br />The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.<br />(Pub.
