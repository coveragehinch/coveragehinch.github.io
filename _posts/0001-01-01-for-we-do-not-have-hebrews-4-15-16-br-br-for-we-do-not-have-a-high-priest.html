{% raw %}Hebrews 4:15-16<br /><br />For we do not have a High Priest who cannot<br />Be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses,<br />But One who has been tempted in all respects like us,<br />Yet without sin, yet without sin.<br /><br />Let us therefore come forward<br />With boldness to the throne of grace<br />That we may receive mercy and find grace<br />For timely help.{% endraw %}
