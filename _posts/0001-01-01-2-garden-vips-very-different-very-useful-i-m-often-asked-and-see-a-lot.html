{% raw %}I'm often asked, and see a lot of misunderstanding around, charcoal vs ashes.  Both are extremely useful, but very different products of wood and fire that have very different uses.  Ashes are an excellent fertilizing material, containing all the minerals that plants mine from the soil, mostly potassium (potash) and calcium as lime.  Ashes make slash and burn agriculture possible.  Charcoal (aka biochar) has special properties that seem to be able to improve soils for centuries and may help in developing a more long term, sustainable agriculture.<br /><br />COOL VIDEO ON AFRICAN FOREST ISLANDS:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/TgsRnGmI3UU">https://youtu.be/TgsRnGmI3UU</a><br /><br />VIDEO ON 19TH CENTURY BIOCHAR ACCOUNTS, GOOD STUFF!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/waAzDnNFlBk">https://youtu.be/waAzDnNFlBk</a><br /><br />MY BIOCHAR PLAYLIST: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL60FnyEY-eJBzDtNl2YBuem2U9lL3TZfv">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL60FnyEY-eJBzDtNl2YBuem2U9lL3TZfv</a><br /><br />Thank you everyone for the views, shares and support :D<br /><br />Buy less, but buy it through my Amazon Affiliate links!
