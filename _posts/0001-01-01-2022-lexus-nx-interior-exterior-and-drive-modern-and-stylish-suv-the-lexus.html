{% raw %}The Lexus NX has returned for a second, much-improved generation after debuting in 2015 and arrives in showrooms this fall. The renewed luxury compact luxury SUV brings lots to the table, including a first-ever plug-in hybrid optionâ€”one of no fewer than four powertrain options. For 2022, the NX sports an a freshened take on its extroverted exterior styling and a fully redesigned interior that no longer subjects passengers to Lexus's awful little touchpad infotainment controller.<br /><br />With the former NX300 and NX300h hybrid now out of the picture, the model range includes the NX250, NX350, NX350h hybrid, and NX450h+ plug-in hybrid. Based on the Toyota RAV4 platform, the 2022 Lexus NX lineup benefits from loads of standard equipment, including Lexus Safety System+ 3.0 and both wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.<br /><br />Lexus offers three trim levels across the NX lineup. Premium and Luxury grades are available on all NX models; buyers who get into an NX350 or NX450h+, however, have the option to choose the F Sport treatment for a bolder appearance. A panoramic moonroof, premium paint, triple-beam LED headlamps, and a body kit are among the surplus of optional upgrades. Hybrid models come equipped with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), whereas the gas-powered NXs have an eight-speed automatic. On every NX save for the NX250, an all-wheel-drive system is standard.<br /><br />The base model NX250 configured with front-wheel drive starts at $39,035; as its name implies, it comes with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 203 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque. Upgrading to the NX250 Luxury AWD adds heated and ventilated seats, a 14.0-inch touchscreen, ambient lighting, and a 10.0-inch head-up display while inflating the price to $46,775.<br /><br />Stepping up to the NX350 lands you a turbocharged 2.4-liter I-4 producing a respectable 275 hp and 317 lb-ft of torque. It also carries a window sticker of $42,625. Want your NX350 more upscale? The Luxury trim balloons the price tag to $50,075 while adding in leather-trimmed seats, black open-pore wood trim, and a heated steering wheel.<br /><br />The Lexus NX350h hybrid has a starting price of $42,125 and uses an electrically assisted 2.5-liter gas engine. This powertrain is good for 239 hp, an increase of 20 compared to the somewhat similar setup in the RAV4 Hybrid. An NX350h Luxury will run you $49,575 and, among other items, adds 20-inch wheels, panoramic roof glass, front door courtesy lamps, and leather upholstery.<br /><br />Buyers looking for luxe finishes, performance, and efficiency in one package will probably enjoy being at the wheel of an NX450h+, the first Lexus plug-in hybrid. The PHEV NX450h+ also employs a 2.5-liter gas engine backed by an electric motor and a starter/generator powering the front wheels. (Like the NX350h, it has a RAV4 counterpart, in this case the 302-hp RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid.) A second motor spins the rear axle, and with the lithium-ion battery fully charged, the NX450h+ delivers an estimated 36 miles of electric range. This luxurious PHEV starts at $56,635, with the F Sport variant tacking on another $1,340 bringing the total to $57,975.<br /><br />Subscribe now ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/M7yJtf">https://goo.gl/M7yJtf</a><br />Press the little bell ((ðŸ””)) to get notifications<br /><br />Follow us <br />Facebook : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fb.me/4drivetime">https://www.fb.me/4drivetime</a><br />twitter : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/4Drivetime">https://twitter.com/4Drivetime</a>{% endraw %}
