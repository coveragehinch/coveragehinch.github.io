{% raw %}In this video I tear out my old nasty concrete stairs and build a new deck made out of pressure treated wood, composite decking/handrails and PVC trim.  This deck is 4 feet by 8 feet.  Let me know how I did in the comments!<br /><br />More detailed deck build videos:<br />Concrete stair removal - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/kACW9xrEwXc">https://youtu.be/kACW9xrEwXc</a><br />Installing deck footings - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/HoIe_-0kdfo">https://youtu.be/HoIe_-0kdfo</a><br />Deck framing - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/vGTi_3Xtz4U">https://youtu.be/vGTi_3Xtz4U</a><br />Picture frame decking - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OHQOb7kH9dg">https://youtu.be/OHQOb7kH9dg</a><br />Building a concrete pad - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xbM_hBhzIgc">https://youtu.be/xbM_hBhzIgc</a><br />Building stair stringers - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CqcgKulah_I">https://youtu.be/CqcgKulah_I</a><br /><br />Want to support my channel for free?<br />If you click this link <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3k9YUBB">https://amzn.to/3k9YUBB</a> and buy anything from Amazon, I will get a small commission.
