{% raw %}Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks to Dr. Drew Pinsky about how Dr. Fauci lost his trust, how the CDC created vaccine hesitancy, the truth about mask efficacy, and how woke culture is creating a climate where doctors are afraid of being cancelled for stating scientific facts. First, Dr. Drew discusses how the CDC ignored everything it had learned from the HIV epidemic and lost the trust of the public. He explains why Fauci’s denial of gain of function research funding caused him to no longer trust him despite looking up to him for decades. Dr. Drew discusses how people don’t know who to trust for public health advice and why it was such a disgrace that the decisions that Joe Rogan made with his doctor resulted in such an outcry. He also explains why the French vaccine mandate is much more rational than the type we are trying to apply here in the United States. Next, Dr. Drew discusses the massive negative effects of mask wearing on children and why school mask mandates could backfire. He shares shocking data on depression in children and child anxiety that should have us all concerned. Do masks work? Despite all the talk of mask mandates there is little talk of the actual efficacy of masks. Dr. Drew shares the results of a few studies that the media continues to ignore that severely weaken the case that masks significantly reduce the transmission rates of COVID. Finally, Dr. Drew discusses his book “It Doesn't Have to Be Awkward”, which he co-wrote with his daughter. He also shares stories of doctors that have lost their jobs for going against woke culture and why so many doctors now live in fear of discussing biological facts. He explains how it was a fear of lawsuits and not dealing with pain management that helped create the opioid epidemic. He explains how the current manipulation of language makes transgender healthcare more difficult than it needs to be and puts patients at risk.<br /><br />Is the state of US news driving you crazy?
