Stay up to date with the series!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVknSjv5hAFKBv9s6Y1SDdI4XPc0G-tOU">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVknSjv5hAFKBv9s6Y1SDdI4XPc0G-tOU</a><br /><br />Edward Kenway is a British privateer-turned-pirate and eventual member of the Assassin Order; father of Haytham Kenway, and grandfather of Ratonhnhak√©:ton (Connor Kenway), the two playable characters of Assassin's Creed 3. As is the case in previous games in the Assassin's Creed series, the story is divided into two intertwined halves, with one in the present day, one in a historical setting, and the events of each influencing the other. Although the present-day story had previously established that an Animus was required to view one's ancestors memories, the ending of Assassin's Creed III implies that Desmond's genetic memories have now been uploaded on to 'the cloud'. As such, the player's character is hired by Abstergo Entertainment to investigate a pivotal movement in Desmond's ancestry; the Assassin Edward Kenway. A notorious pirate and privateer operating during the Golden Age of Piracy, Kenway's story is set in the Caribbean, and mixes open-ended ship-based exploration with combat and land-based adventures on a number of Caribbean islands, as well as parts of southern Florida. <br /><br />My Social Media Links<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/chris_smoove/">https://www.twitch.tv/chris_smoove/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/Chris_Smoove">http://twitter.com/Chris_Smoove</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chrissmoove/">https://www.instagram.com/chrissmoove/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/ChrisSmoove">http://www.facebook.com/ChrisSmoove</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://chrissmoove.com">http://chrissmoove.com</a>{% endraw %}
