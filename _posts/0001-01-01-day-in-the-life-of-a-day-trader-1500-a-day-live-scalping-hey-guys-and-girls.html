{% raw %}Hey guys and girls. Finally, I'm giving you a typical day in my life. I don't think most day traders have a daily routine, so I want to share mines.<br /><br />I usually wake up around 7:30am EST, and wash my face and brush my teeth. After that, I'm looking at higher time frame levels to trade from. 9:30am EST is when the market opens and that's when I'm looking for high-quality trades. <br />In this video, I will show you some live scalping. <br /><br />At 12:00pm EST, I am eating lunch in my house or sometimes go outside. And then I'm going for a nice drive around my neighborhood. If the weather is good, then I might get out of the car and go for a quick walk in the park. <br /><br />After that, I'm heading back home to enjoy a nice swim in my pool. And guess what? Around 5:30pm EST,  I'm back at my trading desk to review all of the trades that I took today on the chart.<br /><br />.....................................................................................................................<br /><br />Training program<br /><br />Here is the discount:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tradewinprofit.podia.com/academy?coupon=BLACKFRIDAY">https://tradewinprofit.podia.com/academy?coupon=BLACKFRIDAY</a><br /><br />.....................................................................................................................<br /><br />Telegram group (free): <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/realdaytradingaddict">https://t.me/realdaytradingaddict</a><br /><br />.......................................................................................................................<br /><br />INSTAGRAM: Daytradingaddict<br /><br />EMAIL: bigben1187@gmail.com<br /><br />.......................................................................................................................<br /><br />Disclaimer:  <br /><br />The information contained in this presentation is solely for educational purposes, and does not constitute investment advice.
