{% raw %}Singapore, one of the world’s most advanced economy is yet again increasing its presence in the shipping industry. According to the world bank, Singapore is the 2nd busiest port just behind Ningbo-Zhoushan port where China’s leading foreign trade happens.<br /><br />Correction(s):<br /><br />Tuas mega port will be constructed in four phases, don't three.<br />The completion date is in the 2040s not 2040 specifically.<br /><br />Courtesy of Josephlimdesigns, CNA, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore<br /><br />Footages are for presentation only and they may or may not represent the actual infrastructure.<br /><br />Narrated by Tom Mckay<br />Video Produced by Connecting Dotx<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/connectingdotxkhi/">https://www.instagram.com/connectingdotxkhi/</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/behindasian">https://www.facebook.com/behindasian</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/behindasia">https://www.instagram.com/behindasia</a><br /><br />Enquiries: behindasian@gmail.com<br /><br />Brought to you by the Behind Asian Team.<br /><br />Music(s):<br />The Documentary by Proxy<br /><br />Start protecting yourself on the web at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.nordvpn.net/SH3W7">https://go.nordvpn.net/SH3W7</a> save big and get 3 months FREE!<br /><br />Summary Script<br /><br />With the state of the current global world shifting to a more online presence, the need for shipments has been skyrocketing. This opportunity presents a better economic advantage to Singapore, as it holds such an important shipping lane. It is, in fact, that in the past, the wealth accumulated early on within the region was because Singapore hosted one of the world’s most important seaport hubs.<br /><br />Today, however, the maritime industry presents several challenges to the world and Singapore in terms of technological advancement, labor shortages, and more. It is such a necessity to find innovative ways to navigate in the world we live in today, and that is why Singapore came out with a $20 billion Singaporean dollar massive plan to create the world’s largest fully automated terminal.<br /><br />This is the Tuas Mega-port project, Singapore’s plan to lead the world’s maritime industry. This grand infrastructure plan will be like no other. With automation being the key centerpiece, it is expected to be powered with 1,000 automated cranes and 1,000 driverless vehicles to ensure that it becomes as efficient as it can. There will even be state-of-the-art smart sensors to detect piracy products, and the usage of data analytics to combat traffic congestions. To ensure that Singapore is targeting a green environment, it is incorporating the use of the Internet of things or IoT to help deliver sustainable solutions.<br /><br />Singapore’s government has also taken into account the need for better marine tech-focused businesses in its country, enough for it to justify a massive $15 billion dollar framework for funding to start-ups that operates in green, data processing, and cybersecurity companies.<br /><br />This investment will help businesses operating in Singapore to help with international transactions, as this is a port there will be a lot of shipments, then the necessity to have good communication, good security, and efficient use of data is such a vital key point for the usage of its port. Cybersecurity is such an essential industry with the years to come, especially knowing that this infrastructure will be operated with the use of technology. It poses a risk for cyber attacks. Hence, Singapore’s investment in better security is an excellent move.<br /><br />The size of Tuas mega-port will be twice that of Ang Mo Kio New Town, this means that it will have a total capacity of over 65 million twenty-foot equivalent units, which is, more than the current 50 million capacity of current terminals combined. It will even have 8.6 kilometers of wharves and infrastructure to accommodate the world’s largest container ships in the world. It will also construct 21 deep-water berths that will have the capacity to handle 20 million standard-sized container units a year.<br /><br />The estimated fully operational date of Tuas mega port is still quite a far away, which is the year 2040, the construction has started in 2015. However, this will be constructed into 3 phases, the first phase which will have 294 hectares, and the second phase of about 387 hectares, both of which will be reclaimed land.<br /><br />The construction of the Tuas mega-port will increase Singapore’s economy to a new level, it is known that over 7 percent of Singapore’s overall GDP was because of the maritime sector, and even more so that it contributes to over 170,000 workers. With the creation of this mega-port, even though it will take away several other jobs because of automation and artificial intelligence, it will still create newer jobs for people who function in the technology world, this is especially important as Singapore is shifting to a more technology stance.<br /><br />Once the completion of Tuas mega-port has finished, it will finally end the long-running operations of the current PSA city terminals and Pasir Panjang Terminal, which started way back in 1819. This means that Tuas will be the only port Singapore will have.{% endraw %}
