{% raw %}[<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.rollit.co.nz]">http://www.rollit.co.nz]</a> Feeding out hay as a drystock and small lifestyle block farmer is a pain. You're limited to small bales unless you have the capital to throw down on a tractor and feed out equipment.<br /><br />I have come up with a solution which lets you wrap bales and leave them in a paddock and then feed them to animals without the waste, without the effort and in a fraction of the time.<br /><br />Find out more by visiting http:\\www.rollit.co.nz today{% endraw %}
