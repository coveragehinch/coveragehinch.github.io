{% raw %}Anon writes, “Recently, an eight-month relationship came to what feels like an “end,” when my partner said that she needed “time and space” to herself.  Since then, text messaging slowed, and then stopped completely. She won’t answer my phone calls.  Can you please comment on one of your outstanding videos as to what the other partner should do, when it comes to a request for “time and space?” Is it best to move on? Is it best to be patient, and wait? Is a request for “time and space” an end-all?”<br /><br />Want to work with me? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.susanwinter.net/consultation/">http://www.susanwinter.net/consultation/</a><br /><br />WANT TO CREATE A HEALTHY LOVE THAT LASTS? <br /><br />My FREE audio course, 'How To Grow Together,' is a great tool for those of you who've found love and want to keep it.
