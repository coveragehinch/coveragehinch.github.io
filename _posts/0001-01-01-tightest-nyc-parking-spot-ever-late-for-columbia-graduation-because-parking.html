{% raw %}Late for Columbia graduation because parking lots are all full and no spots anywhere except this one which at first glance looks too tight for the Yukon XL.  Note there is no rear cam or any type of sensors on this vehicle and despite the camera person yelling &quot;stop&quot; once early on,  no vehicles were touched in effectuating this park{% endraw %}
