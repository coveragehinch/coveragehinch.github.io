Introducing Screwed Deck. One of the best opening tricks you will ever see, this routine uses very little sleight of hand and works great in any venue. The magician reveals a deck of cards that have been screwed together like a pool cue. But they appear to have been mis-matched.<br /><br />What's the solution? Simple. The magician gives the deck another twist and it becomes an ordinary, examinable pack of cards. Immediately afterwards you can begin your next card trick. It's a clever and creative routine like no other. Watch Craig perform it and let us know what you think in the comment section.ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡<br /><br />Magic Lives! - Everyday At 6PM! ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡<br />Every day Craig performs amazing well-known tricks that are famous across the magicians world!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS5im42U1ZvbCwGpY4w1-zD19UBxOJR1x">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS5im42U1ZvbCwGpY4w1-zD19UBxOJR1x</a><br /><br />5 X 5 Magic! - Mondays At 9PM! ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡<br />Every week Craig Petty talks about 5 totally random topics and only has 5 minutes to get his point across!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS5im42U1ZvbW8uRlqbb0assjqvQDsaMR">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS5im42U1ZvbW8uRlqbb0assjqvQDsaMR</a><br /><br />Talk Magic! - Tuesdays, Wednesdays &amp; Saturdays At 9PM! ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡<br />Every Tuesday on Magic TV we present Talk Magic.
