We are so excited to get further into this tropical paradise fixer-upper makeover. Today we are painting our front door a fun and surprising or, if you know us, not so surprising color, installing some amazing Google Nest products to make our home smarter and more secure, and brining in all kinds of colorful and cozy pieces from our furniture line to furnish this colorful before and after. The only problem is our shipping container won't open, so let's see if Joey can DIY his way into it. We are so excited about all of the before and after makeover opportunities in our new home, so get ready for color and some more color, with a little more color on top of that DIY sundae, as we make this island fixer-upper our paradise dream home! #homemakeover #interiordesign #paradise<br /><br />Shop this episode!<br />Nest Doorbell (battery): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gle/2ZXPlyF">https://goo.gle/2ZXPlyF</a><br />Nest Cam (battery): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gle/3k4tT27">https://goo.gle/3k4tT27</a><br />Nest Cam (wired): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gle/3o3OlBc">https://goo.gle/3o3OlBc</a><br /><br />Follow us everywhere:<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mrkate/">https://www.instagram.com/mrkate/</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mrkate">https://www.tiktok.com/@mrkate</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mrkate">https://twitter.com/mrkate</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/mrkatedotcom">https://www.facebook.com/mrkatedotcom</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/mrkate/">https://www.pinterest.com/mrkate/</a><br /><br />This episode wouldn't have been possible without the help of these creative geniuses: V Robitaille, Andrew Tran, Bryce Pederson, Chris Balidio, Evan Asato, Abby Lee, Eric Espiritu and Tobias Smith<br />Audio Tracks: Epidemic Sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/rGjgC">http://share.epidemicsound.com/rGjgC</a>{% endraw %}
