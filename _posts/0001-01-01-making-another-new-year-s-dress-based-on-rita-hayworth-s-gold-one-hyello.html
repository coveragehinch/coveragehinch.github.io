Happy Gamin'! <br />Thank you so much Farmville 3 for sponsoring this video!!<br /><br />ANOTHER New Years is upon us and man, what a year 2021 was. And by that I mean that it felt like about 23 years. This week I wanted to take on one of my dream dresses, the gold gown that Rita Hayworth wears in &quot;Cover Girl&quot;! I figured while I sew, I could sit and chat with you about this past year and some hopes for the year ahead! <br />I love you all and I am so, so grateful for everything, and I'll SEE YA NEXT YEAR. <br />heh. heh. classic. <br /><br />Insta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rachel.maksy/">https://www.instagram.com/rachel.maksy/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/rachelmaksy/">https://www.facebook.com/rachelmaksy/</a><br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rachel-maksy">https://teespring.com/stores/rachel-maksy</a><br />TikTok: @rachelmaksy{% endraw %}
