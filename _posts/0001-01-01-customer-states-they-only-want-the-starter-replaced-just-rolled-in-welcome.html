(Did not receive information on make/model.) The wheel bearing has been worn and loose for so long that it did quite the damage to the spindle. Scary that they were driving on this.<br />0:15 This vehicle just came in for a power steering leak, but from what you can hear the engine has quite the knock. <br />0:25 This clip was sent in by a good friend of mine. He say's he unfortunately has seen this quite a bit. The oil filter looks old also, so who knows if they even changed the oil and filter. <br />0:49 Battery terminal is loose from the other shop installing the battery. That's why the customer has had to jumpstart the vehicle every time. <br />0:58 Customer didn't want their battery terminal fixed. This is something you'd see on The Red and Green show lol.<br />1:04 This vehicle (look's like a Toyota Corolla) came in for a state safety inspection, but it'll most definitely fail because of the front license plate being blocked and the extremely dark tint on the windshield and side windows.<br />1:18 As described. I'm glad the dog did that lol.<br />Not too sure on year/make &amp; model.<br />1:25 As described. When the indoor air is dry, wood will release moisture. We all make mistakes and I don't think the customer knew this but either way. Hopefully they clean this up quick before it becomes more of an issue!<br />1:54 Rear left spring off of a 1 ton dump truck. You can definitely see that they had it overloaded. <br />2:00 Look's to be 8 different batteries, who knows lol. But what a mess. Look's easier just to replace it with a normal battery, but hey what do I know lol. <br />2:08 As described. Pretty scary they were driving this vehicle but I'm glad they approved the work. I was told it was a Nissan, that's it. Not sure what model.<br />2:29 2020 KIA Soul with a bad CVT issue. Mechanic who sent it in didn't say what the exact issue was. From what I read online these CVT's seem to have quite the issues, even at low miles!<br />2:37 What have you guys done to help customers from getting their catalytic converters stolen?<br />2:47 Customer had the check engine light on their vehicle so they covered it with electrical tape lol.<br />2:55 Outro. Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
