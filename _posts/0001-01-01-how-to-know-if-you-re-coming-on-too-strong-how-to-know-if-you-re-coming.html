{% raw %}How to know if you’re coming on too strong if she starts backing away.<br /><br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter I discuss an email from a viewer who has only been following my work for about two weeks. He was dating a woman he met on Bumble for about three and a half weeks, but then she started backing away and then told him she was not over her ex and tried to friend zone him. He declined and told her to get in touch if she changed her mind. He says if he doesn’t hear from her in a few months that he will reach out to her again and asks my opinion.<br /><br /><br /><br />“You should only spend your time with people who are excited to see you. If you love and value yourself, you won’t want to spend your time with people who make you feel like an option. If you have a low opinion of yourself, you’ll make excuses for somebody’s low interest in you and stick around hoping to change their mind. Why? We act consistently with how we view ourselves to be. Life is about setup. Create a social life revolving around your passions, hobbies and interests and people who like the same things. Like attracts like. People who like the same things tend to like each other. You attract how you act.” ~ Coach Corey Wayne<br /><br /><br />Click the link below to read the article “How To Know If You’re Coming On Too Strong” on my website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://understandingrelationships.com/how-to-know-if-youre-coming-on-too-strong/68827">https://understandingrelationships.com/how-to-know-if-youre-coming-on-too-strong/68827</a><br /><br />If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.
