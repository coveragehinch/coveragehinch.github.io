{% raw %}Marching orders US Secretary of State gave Buhari, How Charles Soludo floored Andy Uba<br /><br />Even Before the US Secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, arrived in Nigeria, Dr. Damages had imagined the message he had for President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. In a not so diplomatic way, Dr. Damages reveals the message and how to relates to Attorney General Malami and Bola Tinubu. Have you ever imagined what Buhari says when he meets world leaders? Dr. Damages uses the Cop 26 summit in Scotland as an illustration. The two most prominent prophets in Anambra State failed to predict how the November 6 election would turn out. Your good doctor tells you who they are and what fooled them.{% endraw %}
