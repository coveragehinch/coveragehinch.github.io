{% raw %}I'm not going to lie, this came as a complete surprise to me! I just assumed that that the super small and portable ResMed AirMini would have a different turbine than the big AirSense 11. <br /><br />The profit margins on that the AirMini must be absolute huge! I mean there's nothing in it except the  $20 turbine and a tiny PCB board. <br /><br />Now the AirMini is a lot noisier than the AirSense11 during operation and this is simply because it has no foam. The AirSense 11 has heaps of it. A lot more than the AirSense 10.<br /><br />I have found that the AirSense 11 is slightly quieter than the AirSense 10 but it's clearly not due to the turbine. It's 100% related to the foam components which have slightly improved the sound.<br /><br />Thanks for watching.
