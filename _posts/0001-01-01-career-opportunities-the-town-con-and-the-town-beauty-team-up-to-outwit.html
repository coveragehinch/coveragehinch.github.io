{% raw %}The town con and the town beauty team up to outwit a half-wit pair of would-be burglars in this hilarious comedy from John Hughes. Frank Whaley stars as Jim Dodge, a smooth-talking small-town guy with a knack for putting up a front -but no talent for holding down a job. But Jim's life suddenly takes a turn for the fantastic when he finds himself locked inside the local department store one night with Josie McClellan (Jennifer Connelly), the daughter of the town's wealthiest citizen. And when this unlikely pair is treated to a surprise visit from two bargain-hunting burglars (Dermot Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney), the laughs keep escalating in this delightfully entertaining look at small-town America.
