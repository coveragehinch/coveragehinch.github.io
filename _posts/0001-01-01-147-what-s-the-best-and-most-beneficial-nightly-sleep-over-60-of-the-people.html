{% raw %}Over 60% of the people in the United States have issues getting good sleep, going to sleep or staying awake throughout the whole night. One of the things that one can do to be able to help getting to sleep is taking magnesium right before going to bed.  Magnesium has a tremendous amount of benefits and this involved in hundreds of biochemical reactions in the body. Magnesium helps convert food into energy, helps create new proteins from amino acids, helps create and repair DNA, is part of the construction and relaxations of muscles, and it also helps regulate the neurotransmitters which send messages throughout your brain and your nervous system. <br /><br />Magnesium glycinate has been found to be effective in improving the amount and quality of sleep. That being said numerous research have shown that being sound asleep between 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM the next morning will give you the best and most restful sleep. Take into account the amount of time that it will actually take you to go to sleep to be able to benefit from those magical 4 hours. <br /><br />There are numerous factors that influence weather one will be able to have good sleep or not. Stress of any kind will affect your ability to go to sleep and stay asleep. That includes money issues, work issues, relationship issues, and the like. Anxiety, excitement over upcoming events and depression will also affect your ability to get good restful sleep. Meditation and stretching exercises might be of help if you're the type of person that takes everything that happens to you into your night’s sleep.<br /> <br />Proper nutrition and balancing your macronutrients correctly as well as stop eating three to four hours before going to bed and keep properly hydrated throughout the day will have an effect weather you will be having a good night's sleep or not.{% endraw %}
