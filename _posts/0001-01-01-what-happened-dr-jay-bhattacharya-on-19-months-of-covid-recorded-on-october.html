{% raw %}Recorded on October 13, 2021<br /><br />From the very beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya has been on the front lines of analyzing, studying, and even personally fighting the pandemic. In this wide-ranging interview, Dr. Bhattacharya takes us through how it started, how it spread throughout the world, the efficacy of lockdowns, the development and distribution of the vaccines, and the rise of the Delta variant. He delves into what we got right, what we got wrong, and what we got really wrong.  Finally, Dr. Bhattacharya looks to the future and how we will learn to live with COVID rather than trying to extinguish it, and how we might be prepared to deal with another inevitable pandemic that we know will arrive at some point.<br /><br />For further information: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hoover.org/publications/uncommon-knowledge">https://www.hoover.org/publications/uncommon-knowledge</a><br /><br />Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?
