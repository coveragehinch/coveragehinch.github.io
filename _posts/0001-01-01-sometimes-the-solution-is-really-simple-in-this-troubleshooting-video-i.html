{% raw %}In this troubleshooting video, I show how a simple worn-out nozzle caused a whole lot of headaches for me on my Artillery 3D Hornet. The cause of the blown-out nozzle was making some custom bottle caps in Proto-Pasta metal/carbon fibre filaments and since it was a brass nozzle it got chewed up pretty good. Nozzles are consumable, it is way simpler to just change them out as needed vs cleaning them. Trust me on this, I have tried to salvage junked nozzles one too many times!<br /><br />I also wanted to make this video to call out everyone who thinks that if their machine is having print quality issues it is because of &quot;calibration&quot; issues. Unless somehow your machine's settings were overridden in the gcode/it was flashed with the wrong firmware that can't happen. Generally speaking, the source of the problem is simpler than we want to give credit for. Start simple and work your way up to the more complex stuff.  <br /><br />You can also directly support the channel through these links:<br /><br />Support me on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/makeitwithcalvin">https://www.patreon.com/makeitwithcalvin</a><br /><br />Amazon Affiliates: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2qeWN3l">https://amzn.to/2qeWN3l</a><br /><br />Check out my Shapeways store here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shapeways.com/shops/calvin'screations">https://www.shapeways.com/shops/calvin'screations</a><br /><br />Check out my Etsy here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://etsy.me/2nRMnWk">http://etsy.me/2nRMnWk</a> <br /><br />Check out my Merch here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.merchminion.com/store/Make-it-with-Calvin-c27444206">http://www.merchminion.com/store/Make-it-with-Calvin-c27444206</a><br /><br />Donate to the channel directly here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/MakeItWithCalvin">https://www.paypal.me/MakeItWithCalvin</a><br /><br />Proto-Pasta Affiliate link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.proto-pasta.com?aff=13">http://www.proto-pasta.com?aff=13</a><br /><br />Social media:<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MakeItWithCal">https://twitter.com/MakeItWithCal</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MakeItWithCalvin/">https://www.facebook.com/MakeItWithCalvin/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/makeitwithcalvin/">https://www.instagram.com/makeitwithcalvin/</a><br /><br />Check out my models:<br /><br />Thingiverse: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/MakeItWithCalvin">https://www.thingiverse.com/MakeItWithCalvin</a><br /><br />Pinshape: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinshape.com/users/106868-make-it-with-calvin">https://pinshape.com/users/106868-make-it-with-calvin</a>{% endraw %}
