Seen this a couple of times and always check your u-joints!<br />Mechanic also said this: &quot;Unknown at this time the extent of damages, as the C5 clutch and rear planetary can get damaged from this type of failure as well, but likely starting in the couple thousands and going up from there.&quot;<br />0:20 Failed p/s rack end seals which caused the inner tie rod boots to fill up with p/s fluid. Surprisingly didn't leak out of the boots. <br />0:38 Did not get any more information regarding this clip &amp; pictures.<br />0:56 I think those were most definitely more then a slight vibration lol. <br />1:09 Did not receive any more information regarding this clip.<br />1:25 Somebody's in trouble, but crazy enough this is not the first time we've seen this on the channel.<br />1:36 I didn't think this was real but you can see all the scratches and dents on the trunk. <br />1:45 Child locks. Get's people all the time.<br />2:05 Missing CV Axle on drivers side.<br />2:20 Well that's scary! The mechanic said they told the customer he needed new outer tie rod ends on both sides. Customer approved repairs.<br />2:31 Really worn rotors and brake pads. Scary how often we see this now.<br />2:54 Outro. Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
