Today’s topic to you fellow believers is that ‘your enemies can not block your blessings but you can if you keep doing certain things.<br /><br /> Lamentations 3:37 illustrates that no one can speak and have it happen unless the Lord has decreed it. As a believer, it is important to continuously remind yourself of the power of God over everything on earth and in heaven and that power which you carry as a child of God. How do we do that? Through scripture. Scriptures are for rejuvenation, revitalization, clarification, inspiration and much more. We must be diligent in studying God’s word to improve our knowledge of who we are in Christ. In Christ, we have been bestowed with so many spiritual blessings.<br /><br />WHAT ARE SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS?<br />These are in simple terms, gifts in Christ Jesus. In Ephesians 1, Paul, a popular apostle and writer of heartfelt letters, wrote in his letter to the Ephesians (The Church located in Ephesus) saying; “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ Ephesians 1:3.”<br /> The word Blessing above is an interpretation of the Greek word Eulogia and it means &quot;to praise, to honour or to favour.&quot; Eulogia also means to benefit”. In Christ, we have been given an excess of eternal benefits and the above verse proves that you can say that God has spoken beneficial things about you, or articulated beneficial things for your advantage. The beneficial things that God has declared for us are impossible for us to count, however, you can find out a couple by reading the word of God that follows as illustrated in Ephesians chapter 1 from verses 4 to 13.<br />Ephesians 1:3 also says that we have been honoured with all profound favours in Christ. What are these profound favours, and how would they help us? As opposed to certain convictions, they are not some puzzling power or vast association saved for a chosen handful. They are the vital advantages of a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. Now, what are some spiritual blessings Paul illustrated in the book of Ephesians 1:4-13? <br />  Picked: Ephesians 1: 4 enumerates that you were Chosen, Selected before the Foundation of the Earth. You are responsible for God’s kingdom the realization that you have been picked before the establishment of the world is for you to understand that your life matters, your creator has chosen you and will continue to choose you no matter what. He calls you worthy of being selected. Your reality (Life) is not a mishap or a result of the normal determination of human endeavour. God has been contemplating your existence (creation) before he at any point said, &quot;Let there be light.&quot; It is astonishing to try and grasp the intentionality and love of God for you. In Jeremiah 1:5 we see that before we are even formed in the womb, he knows who we are. What an outstanding revelation to know that we are chosen by the Almighty God.  <br />  In His Love: Ephesians 1:4 calls us Cherished which is why in Jon 3 verse 16 we see that God thought so highly of us that he sent his only begotten son to die for us in atonement for our sins. Now as Christ is seated in heavenly places and we have been given the same opportunity (those that believe in Christ).  As a man in Christ, you remain in agape or unlimited love. You cannot procure it with your work, effort or offerings but rather by grace through faith in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 2:8-9). You are reminded that you are genuinely cherished in Christ. Have you gotten it? Make the accompanying admission today, &quot;Jesus, I accept your unqualified love.&quot; <br />  Sacred and Blameless: Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 also calls you Sanctified, Holy, Blessed, No record of wrong. As a believer, it is important to know that Christ calls you worthy and nobody should make you feel or think otherwise. In Christ, you are heavenly, blameless and irreproachable. This implies you are fit to serve Him and love Him regardless of your weaknesses. God appreciates you when you approach Him and He readily travels through your life to contact others, not because of your own exemplary (ordinary) nature, but of the nobility of Christ that has been ascribed (freely given) or credited to you.{% endraw %}
