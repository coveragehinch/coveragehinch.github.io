{% raw %}In this video I compare the output waveform of the M18 TOP OFF and what you get out of a conventional USA wall outlet. What are you sacrificing when you use this tool VS the conventional power grid (Besides the obvious power limitation). The result was actually better than I expected... Considering this is an inexpensive inverter, that is a pretty big endorsement! SPOILER - The frequency is similar, it is the Peak-to-Peak that will surprise you!{% endraw %}
