{% raw %}Let's get back to the basics with Principles of Design. Sometimes revisiting our foundation in art can help push our work that much closer to the level we are striving for. Today we're talking about proportion, and some techniques you might have never thought of when it comes to the use of proportion in art. <br /><br />Teachers, are you looking for help with beginner and virtual art education classes? Paint it Kids can help with our library of content that is available on YouTube and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://paintitkids.tv">http://paintitkids.tv</a> for teachers that cannot access YouTube in the classroom. Paint It Kids art education videos are created to be art lessons for elementary students and middle school students that art teachers can use to augment their lesson plans. We also have workbooks available for each of our education videos. Just got to paintitkids.tv and click the workbook tab.<br /><br /> So come and draw along with us. If you have any questions or if you have any ideas of what you want us to do next tag us on a social media post.<br />Follow me on instagram @missjessapaintitkids to keep up with all that we have going on. <br /><br />Other Social Media Platforms:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/paintitkids/">https://www.facebook.com/paintitkids/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=paint%20it%20kids&amp;src=typd">https://twitter.com/search?q=paint%20it%20kids&amp;src=typd</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.paintitkids.tv">http://www.paintitkids.tv</a>{% endraw %}
