{% raw %}Today, we’re taking a tour of my $324,000 chalet located in Gatlinburg, TN—home of the Great Smoky Mountains. Wow, it’s hard to believe it’s been a year since I bought this Airbnb with my business partners. <br /><br />This chalet is listed on Airbnb and makes and absolute killing. I’m sure you’re wondering what the actual net profit is. Guess you’ll just have to watch the video to find out. Do me a solid and ❤️ my listing to help with the Airbnb algo :)<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.airbnb.com/h/thegatlinburgchalet">https://www.airbnb.com/h/thegatlinburgchalet</a><br /><br />I often get asked why I chose to invest in the Gatlinburg area. The answer is pretty obvious once you start analyzing the numbers. Over 12.9M people visit the Smoky Mountains every year—just over one million per month. There aren’t nearly enough short-term rentals—or Chipotles—to meet the demand. <br /><br />I also get asked if the market is over-saturated and worth investing in. I don’t personally think we’ve reached that point since there is a huge disparity between the number of available cabins and people visiting the national park every year. <br /><br />We get into a lot of the market analysis nitty gritty in Host Camp—my 12-month Airbnb mentorship program.
