{% raw %}Today I Drive The Alfa Romeo 75 Cloverleaf and consider if despite the flaws that marked it, the last real Alfa Romeo is worthy of the name. When it was released Alfa only had one more year before being sold off to Fiat. IS the Busso V6 enough to make up for other shortcomings?{% endraw %}
