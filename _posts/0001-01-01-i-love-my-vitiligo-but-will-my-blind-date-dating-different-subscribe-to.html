Mary explained to Truly: “Vitiligo is the depigmentation of the cells in the skin. I lack melanin, which is caused by an autoimmune disorder, which means my body is attacking itself.” Mary’s vitiligo now takes over all of her legs and arms, as well as other patches on her body. There was a time in her life where she would actively try to cover up as much as possible, spending hours applying special makeup to hide her vitiligo. However, over time she has grown in confidence and learned to accept herself fully. Mary admits to having trust issues when it comes to men - she has had some experiences where she feels she has been fetishzised. Mary described what makes dating different for her: “I get in my head too much about how other people view my vitiligo or how they would react or respond. I have a fear of rejection so I reject myself first, but I’m working on it.&quot; Today, Mary is going on her first ever blind date, will her date help restore her faith in men?!<br /><br />Follow Mary here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mary_aquino_/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/mary_aquino_/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Follow John here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/C9LYFE/">https://www.instagram.com/C9LYFE/</a> <br /><br />Thank you to Giovanni Filippi for the use of this photography, you can find more of his work here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/giovannifilippi_/">https://www.instagram.com/giovannifilippi_/</a> <br /><br />Videographer: Carlos de Varona<br />Producers: Ruby Coote &amp; Joel Ross<br />Editor: Sonia Estal<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
