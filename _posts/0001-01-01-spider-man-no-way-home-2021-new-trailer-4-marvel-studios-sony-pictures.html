No Way Home will conclude Tom Hollandâ€™s first MCU Spider-Man trilogy by not only tying together his previous films but also connecting them to the first two Spider-Man film franchises through its villains. There are several notable details in No Way Homeâ€™s trailers that may indicate that the multiverse Spider-Man villains arenâ€™t quite the ones from Sam Raimi and Marc Webbâ€™s films, which could have fascinating ramifications for their roles in the MCU. Moreover, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are expected by many to appear as alternate universe versions of Spider-Man in No Way Home. If theyâ€™re variants of their more familiar incarnations as well, this too would have a significant effect on the film.<br /><br />Attempting to reverse Mysterioâ€™s outing of Spider-Manâ€™s secret identity, Peter Parker works with Doctor Strange to make the world forget about his double life. The spell backfires, causing Spider-Man villains from other universes to enter the MCU. No Way Home will have some of the most memorable cinematic Spider-Man villains return, including Willem Dafoeâ€™s Green Goblin, Alfred Molinaâ€™s Doctor Octopus, and Jaimie Foxxâ€™s Electro. While the Marvel multiverse has been explored in previous MCU properties, No Way Home will be the first movie to center on the concept.<br /><br />Thank You So Much For Watching!<br />Stay Tuned!
