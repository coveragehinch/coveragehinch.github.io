{% raw %}An overview of the evidence surrounding worker democracy. In summary: it's good, but far from perfect.

Mostly the channel will cover economics with a critical perspective but I aim to educate people about economics in the process, so I'll try to explain key concepts and ideas along the way. That way, even if you disagree with aspects of the videos you will hopefully learn something from them.
