DHT is a powerful form of testosterone that can burn out hair follicles. <br /><br />People with too much DHT can develop androgenetic alopecia or pattern hair loss. Onion juice, green tea, rosemary oil, and zinc can help inhibit 5-alpha reductase. <br /><br />Fluoride from your water as well as sulfates from your shampoo can also potentially lead to hair loss. Try getting a shower head that filters out fluoride and use sulfate-free shampoo. <br /><br />Home remedies to help prevent hair loss and regrow hair:<br />1. Onion juice<br />2. Green tea <br />3. Rosemary oil <br />4. Zinc (oysters and red meat) <br />5. Apple cider vinegar (1/3 cup apple cider vinegar to 1 liter of water)<br />6. Consume more protein and trace minerals<br />7. Cruciferous vegetables and sea kelp<br />8. Selenium <br />9. Vitamin D, more sleep, and exercise<br />10. Silica <br />11. Keto and intermittent fasting<br />12. Biotin <br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description">https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.
