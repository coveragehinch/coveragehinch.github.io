{% raw %}At the Moldconstruct Fair in Moldova we decided to put the quality that Frisomat produces to the test in public. Two bolts were placed into a bowl with water to see if they would show any sign of oxidation. <br /><br />At the end of the fair, two days later, they didn't show any sign of oxidation whatsoever!<br /><br />All Frisomat metal parts of a steel industrial building, from the smallest bolt or washer to the biggest column are 100% dip galavanized and ready to take on any weather condition possible.<br />Our steel buildings are built to last!<br /><br />Want to know more about Frisomat?
