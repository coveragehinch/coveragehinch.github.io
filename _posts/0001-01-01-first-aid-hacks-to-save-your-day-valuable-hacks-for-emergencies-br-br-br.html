{% raw %}Valuable hacks for emergencies<br /><br /><br /><br />Hello, crafters! In this video, you will see many first aid hacks that will make your life easier. We will also show you a bunch of cool gadgets that will help you in emergencies. For example, when you or your child have a splinter stuck in your finger, you can use a regular syringe to remove it in seconds. If you have a tube of PVA glue, you can also use it! Just add some of it on top of the splinter and skin around it, let the glue dry, and then carefully remove it with the splinter inside. <br /><br />If you're a parent, you're probably experiencing problems with your child visiting the doctor. If going to the doctor stresses your kid out, grab an antistress toy with you to distract them a little bit. We will show you how to make such a toy yourself (just grab a plastic bottle, some hydrogel balls, and a balloon). <br /><br />Stay tuned, and you will find more life-saving hacks for different emergencies.<br /><br /><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br /><br />01:14 - When your kid doesn't like doctors<br /><br />01:51 - How to remove a splinter<br /><br />04:11 - How to keep your feet smooth<br /><br />05:39 - How to heal a burned tongue fast?<br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
