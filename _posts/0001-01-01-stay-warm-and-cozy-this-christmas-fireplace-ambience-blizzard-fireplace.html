{% raw %}While it snows heavily outside, with wind and almost blizzard like conditions, you can be safe knowing that you don't need to go anywhere, its Christmas and you will be spending time with your friends and family, so just relax in this beautiful Christmas fireplace ambience for a while. With crackling fire and howling winds, in the words of Dean Martin, the weather outside is frightful, but this fire is so delightful. <br /><br />While the kids play with their toys old and new, just have a drink and something to eat by the fire. Or if you're so inclined, take a nap, you deserve it!<br /><br />This scene was rendered in Unreal Engine 4.<br /><br />If you like my content and feel like you want to show some extra support...<br />Perhaps consider 'buying me a coffee' here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/ambientrenders">https://ko-fi.com/ambientrenders</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching and stay safe<br /><br />Ambient Renders<br /><br />Please do not copy, reproduce or redistribute my videos anywhere on the internet, I do not give permission unless its expressly given in writing by myself.
