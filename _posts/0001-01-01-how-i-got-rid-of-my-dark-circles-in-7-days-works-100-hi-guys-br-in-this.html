{% raw %}hi guys,<br />In this video I tried the cold spoon method to get rid of dark circles, eyebags and puffiness around the eye area. All you have to do is place a cold spoon on your eye area and leave it for about 10 to 15 minutes.<br />Leave a spoon in the freezer for 12 to 24 hours and then place it around your area!<br />Apply a little bit of pressure and slowly glide the spoons towards the outer corners, the gliding movement will help drain the fluid that's pulling underneath your eye while the cold spoon will help minimise any puffiness.<br /><br />—————————————————<br />MY SOCIALS 📲 : <br />email: nimesha.ytc@gmail.com<br />Instagram: @nimeshaa ( 2 A’s ) <br />Tiktoks: nimeshaaa ( 3 A’s )<br />Twitter: niimeshaa.
