{% raw %}Who's ready for a wild (albeit ultimately sad) ride? <br /><br />The very deep Portland Trail Blazers came extremely close to beating the Kobe-Shaq Lakers in game 7 of the 2000 Western Conference Finals. They were up 15 in the fourth! Buttttt LA went on a 15-0 run and won. Still, the Blazers were poised for a bright future, expected to be a serious western threat,  to keep putting up a fight with the Lakers.<br /><br />Their near finals berth could have been the first stone in the path to a dominant future.<br /><br />But of course the loss and failure to make it to the finals could be the first stone in a totally different path-- one paved with drug arrests, intra-team violence, and a middling record that belied the promise the team once held.<br /><br />This ride has a steep drop, not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />Written and produced by: Clara Morris<br />Directed and edited by: Jiazhen Zhang<br />Motion Graphics by: Phil Pasternak<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/Nbabae">http://goo.gl/Nbabae</a><br /><br />Enter the Secret Base: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sbnation.com/secret-base">http://www.sbnation.com/secret-base</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/secretbase">https://twitter.com/secretbase</a><br />Check out our full video catalog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/9pMHRV">http://goo.gl/9pMHRV</a><br />Visit our playlists: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/NvpZFF">http://goo.gl/NvpZFF</a><br />Explore SB Nation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sbnation.com">http://www.sbnation.com</a>{% endraw %}
