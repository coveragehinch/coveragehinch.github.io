This is our tour across America. So join us if you’re open to travel, fun, excitement, hiking &amp; exploring. Wish us luck on this adventure! Maybe we’ll see you down the road sometime. Happy trails!<br /><br />My channel is about full time RV Living in an older RV while keeping the wheels rolling on a budget. I do the repairs, updates and upgrades myself. I’ve become my own RV Mechanic/Medic! I seek boondocking opportunities every chance I can and power the RV with 500 watts of solar and approximately 500 amp hours of batteries. RV Resorts are just not our style!<br /><br />Find us on Facebook here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/davesRVlife/">https://www.facebook.com/davesRVlife/</a>{% endraw %}
