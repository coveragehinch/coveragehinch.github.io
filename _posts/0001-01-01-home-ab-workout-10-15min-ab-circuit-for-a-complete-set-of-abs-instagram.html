Aswell you get 25% of your first order :D<br /><br />Use this link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nl.myprotein.com/referrals.list?applyCode=DARKO-RV&amp;li">https://nl.myprotein.com/referrals.list?applyCode=DARKO-RV&amp;li</a><br /><br />A quick but really effective ab workout you can do at home. <br />It will take not more then 10 - 15 minutes.<br /><br />There are 7 exercises:<br />1) Sit-ups (20 reps)<br />2) Leg raises (20)<br />3) Side crunches on your back, elbow to knee ( 15 reps each side)<br />4) Bicycle with only legs ( 20 reps )<br />5) Side crunches on your side with leg raises ( 30 reps each side )<br />6) Hands to feet ( 15 reps )<br />7) Planking ( 1 minute )<br /><br />You can do a burn out after the cicuit training. If you have a place at home you can hang by your hands. You can do a AMRAP with knee raises to get a nice burn in your lower abs.<br /><br />Try this out for a couple of weeks and you will see a difference.<br /><br />PS: if you just started doing abs it will be hard to do some of these exercises. So i recommend you to do half of the reps and only 3 times. And the leg raises, you don't need to straighten your legs all the way.<br /><br />If you enjoyed watching this video please leave a like and or comment down below :D<br />And as always have a really nice day, do what you want.
