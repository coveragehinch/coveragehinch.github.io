{% raw %}Bushcraft and camping for 3 days in the snow. Im doing more scenic shooting and focusing on real hiking and shelter craft. Kinda not in the mood for crafting pot hangers or spoons at the moment. Feeling a draw towards simplicity. Not to craft to... craft. Just traveling through the wilderness with the least amount of energy. Using the resources of nature without destroying it. Walk. Eat. Sleep. Repeat.<br /><br />Also Ive had a lot of comments over the years about gear and how I pack etc. So I try to show a bit more about that in this video. Starting from the bottom at my bag I have the sleeping bag and an empty bag that once contained some sleeping pad that only lasted one outing. The bag is lined on the inside and more smooth on the outside. Inside it at night I stuff my fleece jacket I use for reinforced shell under my jacket. It makes a good pillow. I have the lined side out against my face which is very nice in winter. In summer I have the smooth side out that gives a nice cool feel against the face. Also down there I have a few extra clothing used for change or reinforcement. Then I pack a bag with my pot/kettle and frying pan, and sometimes the folding fire pit protection (but not this time). The bag is a pretty sturdy fabric that protect my gear and clothing from soot or sharp edges. Then I fold some ground cloth and my thermarest neo air xtherm which is my go to sleeping pad for many years. Beside that I pack a dry bag with food, spices, coffee, cup and cutlery. You all know the blue enamel cup by now. I never use wooden kuksas anymore. Because I don't like the feel drinking from one because the rim is too thick. It makes you spill coffee all over yourself when you are tired in the dark. And the main reason is wooden kuksas makes the coffee cold in (I'm not exaggerating) seconds. I just love the metal enamel cups. And when you make a cup of coffee you can warm your cold fingers holding the enamel cup. That don't happen with the wooden kuksa. I know you are suppose to have one of those kuksas dangling outside a pack but I find them completely worthless. And when the coffee do get a bit cool in the enamel cup in really cold winters.. you can just place it in the fire on coals and heat your coffee in seconds.  Usually in the beginning of my trips I eat big hunks of meat, chickens etc. It's something that would be horrible to carry for days. I mostly eat it right away or the day after that. It's not the spoiling of the meat that is the reason, more the weight. I really don't understand why a lot of people are so perplexed about me carrying meat when I don't have a fridge with me... when its fridge cold or mostly below that outsideðŸ™„.  In summer you just bring it frozen and let it thaw slowly insulated in some cloth or whatever if you don't want to eat it right away. Rest of the trip I just eat freeze dried meals I repack (if not the more expensive vacuum packed meals), some eggs (yellow egg box) , potatoes, smoked stuff that last like bacon, weiners etc, got some oats on long hikes and so on. Then comes the small First aid kit, that also contains some articles like a small tooth brush, tweezers, paste, soap,  Second Ferro Rod, skin treatment, wound disinfectant , water proof fire gear, wax, small compass etc. Spreading essential life supportive stuff in different locations does not work fo me. Because I know (by stuff that that happened when I was young and stupid) that if I would find myself in danger... I most likely, sooner or later, will be too tired to think, and thats why I need that important stuff all in one place or I will just tread water. Inside zipped pocket towards the back I keep some tools, knife, gimlet, (auger sometimes) sharpening tool, folding saws if not making bucksaws, tent pegs, cordage etc. On top under the lid I save space for something that needs storage in between camps thats a bit moist (mostly DD magic carpet). On top of my rucksack I mostly have my Canvas Polish Lavvu or similar. Outside I also strap a lamp/lantern and the reflective ridgerest by thermarest. And last but not least The axe outside the bag. If I have side pockets etc on my bag I put water bottles, tools, water purification stuff, gloves there. I slid down sawblades, fishing gear etc in the bag. This usually lands on 10-20 Kg weight.There is more but I'm up to 5000 digits so cant write more because of the limit. <br /><br />Hard it is to hike this way... Why not skis or snow shoes some might ask.. freshly fallen snow like this makes those things obstacles. Bushes or soft ground under the snow makes walking the only option. You sink down anyway. But I find days of walking like this does not damage your body, your knees or whatever. It's like moving in water. Slow and steady. Last day I was tired. The day after that waking up in my bed at home I usually hurt so much (understand I walk 20 times the distance running around filming with the camera) but this time nothing. Thanks for Watching!{% endraw %}
