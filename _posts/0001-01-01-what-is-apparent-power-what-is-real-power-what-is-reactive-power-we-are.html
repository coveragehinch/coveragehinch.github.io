{% raw %}we are going to see what is apparent power, real power and reactive power.<br />And how it is produced.<br />Considered the power produced in power plant or power from some other source  <br />It was connected with load <br />If the load is pure resistance there will not be any reactive power over the system.<br />So according to formula <br />S=P+jQ<br />At this time the power is fully concussed by load and also source is not get disturbed until it get over load<br />Let us considered other case <br />When the load has more inductance or capacitance over it then reactive power will come into picture{% endraw %}
