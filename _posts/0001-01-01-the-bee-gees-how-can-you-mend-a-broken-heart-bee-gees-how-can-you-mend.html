{% raw %}BEE GEES: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart is the first ever feature documentary on the Bee Gees, authorized by Barry Gibb and the families of Robin &amp; Maurice Gibb. The film sets out to discover why their music has been so enduring and persuasive for over half a century. It covers the tale of the Bee Gees rock band â€“ a story of staggering achievement, loss and sorrow, but also serves as an exploration into the underlying creativity behind this enduring phenomenon. The Bee Gees was a creative partnership between blood siblings. From the ages of 6 (the twins, Maurice and Robin) and 9 (Barry), the Gibbs started improvising harmonies and writing musical motifs without any formal training or indeed any awareness of what they were actually doing. It just came naturally. This is the story of three brothers chasing an emotion they felt as kids, the joy of singing together and creating songs from that unique sound.{% endraw %}
