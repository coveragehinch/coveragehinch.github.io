{% raw %}6 December 2021 Riot in Thessaloniki, Greece - When two worlds collide. <br /><br />The one fighting for life on the day that Alexis Grigoropoulos, a 15 years old kid, was murdered in cold blood by a policeman at the Exarchia area of Athens, Greece, on Saturday December 6, 2008. And the other, suppressing the people to protect the autocratic reign of the market economy during the commercialized Christmas period, degrading our lives to focus on the “celebrations” appearances of a city in phenomenical peace. <br /><br />The story of protesting is always attempted to be written by the State. The spectating populations must certainly never know everything about protesting, but they must always know enough to convince them that, compared with protests, everything else seems rather acceptable, or in any case more rational and democratic.<br /><br />More on the 6th of December and its significance in Greece:<br /><br />Back in 2008 the police murder sparked a string of riots that spread like wildfire all over Greece and inspired countless of solidarity actions and riots all over the globe for more than a month. <br /><br />Everything started a few minutes after 9 pm, on the night of 6 December 2008, when a tensed argument between two cops and a group of youngsters ended with the policemen leaving the scene, but only for the murderers to park their patrol car a few blocks away and return to confront the kids with their guns. One of the two cops (Korkoneas) aimed towards the kids and fired two shots. One of the bullets struck 15 years old Alexis Grigoropoulos in the heart and he fell dead. This murder in the heart of Exarchia, an area of Athens frequented by anarchists in Greece, sparked a string of riots that spread like wildfire all over Greece and inspired countless of solidarity actions and riots in more than 70 cities around the world for more than a month. For most Greeks this is a moment marked deeply in memory, since most remember exactly what they were doing when the news of the police murder shook them like a collective electric shock. During those first days, the tens of thousands of protesters that took part did not realize that they were taking part in something that would profoundly define the years to come.<br /><br />For most Greeks this is a moment marked deeply in memory, since most of us remember exactly what we were doing when the news of the police murder shook us like a collective electric shock. During those first days, we did not realize that we were taking part in something that would profoundly define the years to come, something that from a reflex riot against the murder of Alexis on that night of December 6, would turn into a wildfire of riots that quickly spread across the country and shook Greece for more than a month, inspired solidarity actions all over the globe and influenced the resistance movements around the globe in the years that followed. <br /><br />The events were recorded in modern history as &quot;The December Revolt&quot; or &quot;The December Rebellion&quot; and every year since then on that day, dozens of protests and riots take place all over Greece, so as not to forget the cold blooded murder of a 15 years old kid by the greek police.<br /><br />[Video by Alex Litsardakis on Instagram @litsardakis]{% endraw %}
