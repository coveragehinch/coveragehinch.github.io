A group of teenagers hang out together after school - Ryan's parents are gone, and his house is free. They drink, smoke, watch a ratty old VHS tape, and get closer and closer to each other. But as unexpected emotions start to reveal themselves, and the teens start to separate, they soon realize they are not alone. And something inhuman is outside - picking them off one by one.  <br /><br />&quot;Nightfall&quot; Credits:<br />Director - Jake Sanders <br />Writers - Jake Sanders, Jeff Solomon<br />Producers - Jake Sanders, Jeff Solomon <br />Executive Producers - Kendra Ann Sherrill, Nicole Fisher<br />Assistant Director - Kendra Ann Sherrill<br />Director of Photohgraphy - Samuel Wolfe<br />Camera Operator - Adam Gaulke<br />Special Effects/Production Designer - Brandon Knapik<br />Make-Up - Mariah Stork<br />Sound Operator - Jeremy Olson<br />Script Supervisor - Donna Sluijter<br />Editor - Jake Sanders<br />Music Composer - Kyle Cates<br />Visual Effects - Corentin De Saedeleer<br /><br />CAST <br />Claire - Caroline Bailey<br />Ryan - Ian Wells<br />Stacy - Natalee Vu<br />Jerry - Chase Mellinger<br />The Creature - Jacob Hamilton<br />Newscaster - Dustin Klemann<br /><br />About ALTER:<br />ALTER is an ever-expanding platform for the most daring storytellers in the world of horror.
