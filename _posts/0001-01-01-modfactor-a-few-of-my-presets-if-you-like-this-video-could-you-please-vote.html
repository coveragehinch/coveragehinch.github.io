{% raw %}If you like this video could you please vote for it at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/group/EventideVideoContest">http://www.youtube.com/group/EventideVideoContest</a> as it's part of a competition to win an Eclipse - something else I can demo for you! Thanks. :)<br /><br />I love the Modfactor. It has a lot of really cool sounds and possibilities. I like that you can really dig in and find some unexpected stuff. I like that it's up to you to use your imagination to create these sounds. I don't like the power supply; that sucks the big one. I don't like the fact that Eventide have taken nearly a year to release vital updates; that sucks too. But I'm going to keep it because it really does sound so good. Here's a few of my presets. Send me a message if there's a particular setting you want. I'll put up the other 10 patches soon. Cheers.{% endraw %}
