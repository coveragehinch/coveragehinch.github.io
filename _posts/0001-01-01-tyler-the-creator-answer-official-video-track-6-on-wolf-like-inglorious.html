{% raw %}Track 6 on Wolf. Like “Inglorious”, it’s centered around his feelings on his dad not being around.<br /><br />[Lyrics]<br />[Hook 1: Tyler]<br />Because when I call<br />I hope you pick up your phone<br />I'd like to talk to you<br />I hope you answer (x4)<br />Because when I call<br />I hope you pick up your phone<br />I'd like to talk to you<br />I hope you answer<br /><br />[Verse 1: Tyler]<br />Hey Dad, it's me, um...<br />Oh, I'm Tyler, I think I'd be your son<br />Sorry, I called you the wrong name, see, my brain's splitting<br />Dad isn't your name, see Faggot's a little more fitting<br />Mom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare<br />You Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair<br />Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs<br />So you not being near fucking fire-started my damn career<br />But fuck it, I got Clancy, he gave me the chance to see<br />A world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you<br />But sucks you ain't give a fuck and considered a sperm donor now<br />The fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley<br />And I just ain't being passive, nigga<br />You a fucking faggot, nigga<br />Got a show on Monday, guess who ain't getting no passes, nigga?<br />But if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga<br />And call him...<br />I hope he answer<br /><br />[Hook: Tyler and (Syd)]<br />I hope you answer (x4)<br />Because when I call (When I call, baby)<br />I hope you pick up your phone (Please pick up)<br />I'd like to talk to you<br />I hope you answer<br /><br />[Verse 2: Tyler]<br />Suck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts<br />Ace hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck<br />And I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts<br />Frank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic<br />Syd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it<br />Supposed to be gone til November but quickly came back in August<br />I left two months through September to clearly remember all this<br />I would like to tell my grandma, but she just nostalgia<br />I'll call her number<br />But she won't answer<br /><br />[Hook: Tyler (Syd)]<br />I hope you answer (x4)<br />Because when I call (When I call, baby)<br />I hope you pick up your phone<br />(I'd like to talk to you)<br />I hope you answer<br /><br />[Verse 3: Tyler]<br />You claim to hate my fucking guts<br />But say I'm on a island in Thailand and I was wilding<br />And, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts<br />And hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts<br />Phone ain't got no service -- this 3G is fucking worthless<br />Day is getting dark like the area's turning urban<br />You'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a church is<br />But, I'mma get in contact regardless, and<br />I hope you answer<br /><br />[Outro]<br />That last verse was about this girl. Ha ha{% endraw %}
