{% raw %}Well, here it is: my complete historical breakdown of Humongous Entertainment's existence as a company ever since its founding in 1992. I never expected a nearly 2-hour-long video would've come from something like this, but here we are lol.<br /><br />This was, undoubtedly, the biggest video project I've ever taken on in my life, and man oh man does this reaffirm why I don't make long-form content very often. This project was a nightmare to put together to say the least; as I mentioned at the start of the video this was originally supposed to be a one-and-done deal for a video idea I had several years ago. Then during April of 2020 when real world consequences were going down, I had come up with this idea while brainstorming for future video projects because I noticed nobody had really made an in-depth video covering this company's history before. I decided that once I finished the more pressing video series I was making at the time, I would take it upon myself to create the most comprehensive video on the internet discussing the company's existence. Lo and behold, here we are over 1 year later and that project has finally been completed! I hope you all enjoy it!<br /><br />And yes, as teased at the end of the video, this is only part 1 of an 8 video project I intend to continue working on within the next year or so. Let it be known that I WILL be talking about every single Humongous Game ever released in all of the upcoming videos I have planned. Seeing as the Putt-Putt franchise was the first franchise released by Humongous, those are the games I'm going to be tackling first in the next video. Freddi Fish will be after that, and so on and so forth. Please let me know what you thought of this video or what you'd like to see in those future videos down in the comments below!<br /><br />I can tell this series is going to be a massive undertaking but I know what I was getting myself into going into it. This retrospective series is a personal challenge of mine to test myself and prove that I can do it. I don't make long-form content very often but I figured out of all things this would be the prime opportunity to make it happen. Once again I want to thank you all for your continued support, I know for a fact I wouldn't have the motivation to complete something like this if I didn't  have you guys backing me up!<br /><br />Video Chapters:<br />00:00 - Introduction<br />04:30 - Ron Gilbert &amp; The Founding of Humongous<br />16:44 - Humongous' First Adventure Title: Putt-Putt<br />24:48 - The Paradigm Shift: Freddi Fish<br />36:13 - Humongous in 1995<br />48:43 - The All-Time Classic: Pajama Sam<br />56:50 - The GT Interactive Purchase of 1996<br />1:00:55 - The Break Out Year of 1997 (Spy Fox &amp; Backyard Sports)<br />1:16:33 - Corporate Meddling: Infogrames Arrives on the Scene<br />1:31:38 - The Destruction of Humongous Entertainment<br />1:46:13 - Present Day Purgatory<br /><br />============<br />SOCIAL MEDIA<br />============<br />Be sure to follow me on Twitter for all the latest updates on videos and other various posts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ashadowstreak">https://twitter.com/ashadowstreak</a><br /><br />Want your name in my videos?
