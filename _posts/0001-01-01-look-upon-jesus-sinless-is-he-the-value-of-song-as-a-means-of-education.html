{% raw %}The value of song as a means of education should never be lost sight of. Let there be singing in the home, of songs that are sweet and pure, and there will be fewer words of censure and more of cheerfulness and hope and joy. As a part of religious service, singing is as much an act of worship as is prayer. EGW<br /><br />Happy Singing!<br /><br />Thanks to AC!{% endraw %}
