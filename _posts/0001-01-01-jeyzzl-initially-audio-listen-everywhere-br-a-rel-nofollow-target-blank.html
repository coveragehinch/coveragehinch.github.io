Won't you lie for me?<br />The way you did initially<br />Initially<br />Won't you die for me? Won't you stay for me? <br />The way you did initially <br />Initially<br /><br />Don't you talk about the way we used to feel <br />You never had someone getting you for real <br />3 am on the phone cause you were my dream <br />There was nothing that could get in-between<br />But now I'm falling off <br />Telling all this bitches I'll be back tomorrow<br />But now I'm broken off <br />They will never taste the way you did, no<br /><br />Won't you cry for me? Won't you lie for me?<br />The way you did initially<br />Initially <br />Won't you die for me? Won't you stay for me? <br />The way you did initially <br />Initially<br /><br />Speedin' thru the dark streets <br />I won't feel my heartbeat<br />The lights are bringing me relieve <br />Shining one last time <br />And if they go out <br />Don't you bring them back <br />And If they leave now<br />Then that was my sign <br />Get you drippin' take off your disguise <br />I know your thinking <br />I know what you like <br />And I can provide, I can provide<br />Don't be scared by the pain <br />I'll go thru it, but you got to stay <br />And see you thru my eyes <br />My eyes <br />My eyes<br />My eyes<br />My eyes<br />My eyes<br />My eyes{% endraw %}
