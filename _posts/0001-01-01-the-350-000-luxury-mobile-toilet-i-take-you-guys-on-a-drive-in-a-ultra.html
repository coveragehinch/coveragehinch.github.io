{% raw %}I take you guys on a drive in a ultra luxurious Mercedes Sprinter that has been customised by Senzati! <br /><br />This is for sure the most extravagant way of travelling on the road. As it is equipped with seating for 6 people. Electric window tinting! Customisable mood lighting tables and fridges! Also glass cabinet to look after your crystal glasses! <br /><br />One of the best features is that it has a luxury toilet built into the back. All operated by electric private doors! <br /><br />Senzati have done a brilliant job in building this floating office! <br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.senzati.com">http://www.senzati.com</a><br /><br /><br />Big thanks to the guys over there for making my visit so memorable! <br /><br />Thanks JD <br /><br />Music by <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/safakash">https://soundcloud.com/safakash</a>{% endraw %}
