{% raw %}Our minds may or may not already be in holiday mode... The leaking ceiling (yes, you read that right) is fixed and Jamesie is battling some serious teething. But things turn around! We eat some dinner before heading out into the cold. Our destination? The Wrigleyville Chriskindlmarkt! We want to check out EVERYTHING they have to offer and do not leave empty handed. Back at home we introduce the babe to “The Greatest Showman”. He loves it! Peter comes home from the gym with surprises. But unfortunately it’s not Cranberry Sierra Mist!<br /><br />Disney Dopey Challenge American Cancer Society Donation Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://secure.acsevents.org/site/STR?pg=personal&amp;fr_id=101288&amp;px=48024568">https://secure.acsevents.org/site/STR?pg=personal&amp;fr_id=101288&amp;px=48024568</a><br /><br />PO Box:<br />Brookhart<br />PO Box 1199<br />Chicago, IL 60690<br /><br />Business inquiries: tbp32830@gmail.com<br /><br />Hi!
