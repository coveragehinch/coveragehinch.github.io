{% raw %}Is Grian’s Last Life SMP secretly scripted? <br /><br />THIS IS A BIG /J BTW<br /> I doubt it WAS scripted but the coincidence is funny<br /><br />Like Grian’s name being yellow in the intro would make sense since he could’ve mad ethe intro around the time ep 1 happened but the red name one is peculiar to say the least sjhsjdbdh{% endraw %}
