{% raw %}The Convair XF-92 was one of the first aircraft built with the delta wing and inspired some of the most important aircraft in history. Still, test pilots usually hated to fly it, including legendary pilot Scott Crossfield.<br /><br />Most aircraft, particularly ones that can fly faster than the speed of sound, have a delta-wing design. And it was the XF-92 that inspired it. At the time it was built, it was unlike anything that had ever flown before.<br /><br />However, without being anyone's favorite, the Convair XF-92 flew over 300 times between 1948 and 1953 and became one of the most influential experimental aircraft in history.<br /><br />Eventually, even Hollywood came calling, but even there it had a tough break...<br /><br />---<br /><br />Join Dark Skies as we explore the world of aviation with cinematic short documentaries featuring the biggest and fastest airplanes ever built, top-secret military projects, and classified missions with hidden untold true stories.
