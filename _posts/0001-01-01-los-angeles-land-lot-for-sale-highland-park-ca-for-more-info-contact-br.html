This hillside has amazing views of the Downtown Los Angeles skyline and other nice city views. The lot has been subdivided with proposed design concepts to build 3 modern homes. City utility services from street lead directly to property, making it easier for connection. A 2008 preliminary soil and geology investigation report states the land is feasible for the construction of homes. The land is within close proximity to Old Town Pasadena, minutes to Downtown LA, major freeways, shopping, and dining.{% endraw %}
