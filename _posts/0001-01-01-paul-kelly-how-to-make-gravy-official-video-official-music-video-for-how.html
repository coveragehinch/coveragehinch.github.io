What was his name again?<br />Ahh, just a little too much cologne<br />And Roger, you know I'm even gonna miss Roger<br />'Cause there's sure as hell no one in here I want to fight<br /><br /><br />Oh, praise the Baby Jesus, have a Merry Christmas<br />I'm really gonna miss it, all the treasure and the trash<br />And later in the evening, I can just imagine<br />You'll put on Junior Murvin and push the tables back<br /><br /><br />And you'll dance with Rita, I know you really like her<br />Just don't hold her too close<br />Oh, brother, please don't stab me in the back<br />I didn't mean to say that, it's just my mind it plays up<br />Multiplies each matter, turns imagination into fact<br /><br />You know I love her badly, she's the one to save me<br />I'm gonna make some gravy, I'm gonna taste the fat<br />Ahh, tell her that I'm sorry, yeah, I love her badly<br />Tell 'em all I'm sorry, and kiss the sleepy children for me<br />You know one of these days, I'll be making gravy<br />I'll be making plenty, I'm gonna pay 'em all back<br /><br />#PaulKelly #HowToMakeGravy{% endraw %}
