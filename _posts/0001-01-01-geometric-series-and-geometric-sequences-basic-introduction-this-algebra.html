{% raw %}This algebra and precalculus video tutorial provides a basic introduction into geometric series and geometric sequences.  It explains how to calculate the common ratio of a geometric sequence and how to determine the nth term of a geometric sequence.  It explains how to write a general equation for a  geometric series using a simple formula and how to calculate the partial sum of a geometric series as well as the infinite sum if the geometric series converges.  if it diverges, the sum cannot be calculated.  This video also highlights the difference between the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean.  This video contains plenty of examples and practice problems.<br /><br />Get The Full 2 Hour Video on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor">https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor</a><br /><br />Direct Link to The Full Video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Y1w9yP">https://bit.ly/2Y1w9yP</a><br /><br /><br />Full 2 Hour Video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJEWcysAc44">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJEWcysAc44</a><br /><br />Join The Membership Program:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA/join</a><br /><br /><br />Access My Video Playlists:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.video-tutor.net">https://www.video-tutor.net</a><br /><br />How To Pass Difficult Math &amp; Science Classes:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2UTLsbR">https://amzn.to/2UTLsbR</a> <br /><br />Disclaimer:  Some of the links associated with this video may generate affiliate commissions on my behalf should you decide to make a purchase through such websites.{% endraw %}
