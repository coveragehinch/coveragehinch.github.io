{% raw %}Roberto Carlos da Silva Rocha is considered by many to be one of the best left backs in the history of football. This video is a brief summary of Roberto Carlos ' biography, from the early days in Brazil, and how he managed to change from a poor worker at a textile factory to the Roberto Carlos we all know. That was by starting his football career with local Brazilian teams till moving to Europe and later on joining Real Madrid, not to forget his achievements with the Seleção (Brazil national football team). Robert Carlos which was know for his speed, shooting power, and ability to take free kick shots ended his football career leaving behind him amazing goals which remain till now in the memories of many of his fans. One of these goals was the stunning curved free kick against France in the late 90's. The free kick was from a very far distance and none of the players expected that Roberto Carlos will shoot directly at the goal. Roberto Carlos ran and shot the ball in a curved pattern ending up in the back of the net. In this video, we're goin to talk about how some physicists discussed and analyzed this goal which many found to be unexplainable.<br /><br />We hope you have a fun time watching the video. <br /><br />Please subscribe to the channel and ring the bell to get the latest videos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbEPXWO38mN7ZqiCR_W_6yA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbEPXWO38mN7ZqiCR_W_6yA</a>{% endraw %}
