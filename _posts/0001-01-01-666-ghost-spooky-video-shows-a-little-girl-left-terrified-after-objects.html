{% raw %}Spooky video shows a little girl left terrified after objects in the house seem to move by themselves. At first the young girl is playing with a toy, while a doll on the floor behind her is seen moving its head to the side and back again - seemingly of its own accord. In the next creepy clip the girl is drawing when papers on the table next to her begin to flutter as if there is a strong wind, even though the curtain behind is perfectly still.{% endraw %}
