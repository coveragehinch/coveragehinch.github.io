{% raw %}&quot;I do not encourage anyone to enter culverts, Unclog anything or enter flooded areas as it can easily become deadly without the proper training&quot;. I unclog drains for fun in my spare time (I have Been Trained In culvert inspections for years with private co) osha trained,<br /><br /> :Exploring Abandoned Anything can be dangerous or Deadly without experience. I don't encourage anyone to enter any Abandoned structure. Not only is safety a concern, but often times its illegal and when possible, i seek out permission from the owner or local police. I simply go to document its history before it's gone forever and leave things the way I find them. I only take pictures and only leave footprints. I assume all the risks &amp; responsibility before doing this. Please don't attempt to do this on your own. Their could be nails, Asbestos, Falling concrete soft floors, animals or other hazards.
