This is the final interior project.  Since there are no permanent bedrooms in this portion of the A-frame, the utility room will serve as our master bedroom until the final bedroom wing is built onto the house. We need to make what is supposed to be the utility room work as a bedroom, laundry room and office until we complete the other side of the house.  The plan is to rearrange the room, build cabinetry for storage, a desk for the computer and add countertops for folding laundry. It's a mess right now but once we are done the whole room will be transformed!<br /><br />Shop Our Apparel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bunkerbranding.com/pages/wild-wonderful-off-grid">https://www.bunkerbranding.com/pages/wild-wonderful-off-grid</a><br /><br />We are a couple who are building our own home from the ground up in the mountains of West Virginia.  After living near the city our entire lives we finally decided to sell it all, pack up our 3 kids and live in an RV on our 73 acres while building our own debt free, off-grid house and learning to live a more self-reliant life.<br />Our house build is documented entirely on our main channel &quot;Wild Wonderful Off-Grid&quot; and our family life vlogs can be found on our secondary channel &quot;Wild Wonderful After Show&quot;{% endraw %}
