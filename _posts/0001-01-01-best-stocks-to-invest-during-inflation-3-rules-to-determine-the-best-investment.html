{% raw %}How to invest if we really have big Inflation? Let's talk worst case scenario, everything going up 5-10% investment These are three rules on stocks which may benefit in a period of high inflation with some inputs from what Warren Buffett has recommended.<br /><br />Rule #1 Businesses that donâ€™t need capital investments<br />Most classic is SIA second is SEMB MAR who ironically is showing some life now.<br />Big picture, in short term stock price is unpredictable and a voting machine.<br />These are companies that need to make capital investments all the time. SIA buy planes, SembMar needs materials to produce ship or rigs.<br /><br />Other examples will include KEPPEL CORP, SEMB CORP heavy industrials or F&amp;N which produces our favourite milk and soft drinks.<br /><br />What abt Starhub, singtel, Netlink and Keppel Infrastructure Trust?<br /><br />If you believe this is the case, I can suggest something for you to consider<br />Look for the ROA return on asset of the company.<br />Filter for it in your shortlist because ROA is return over asset.<br />If the company is a heavy capital investment business, the ROA is typically LOW.<br /><br />Rule #2 Businesses that are Brands<br />Sees candy is his favourite example. PRODUCT STILL IN DEMAND regardless of price.<br />What can we find LVHM, which I covered before on a previous video.<br />Listed in France more easy to access via funds.<br />APPLE? Definitely makes sense<br /><br />What can we see here in Singapore like â€‹F&amp;N or The Hour Glass?<br /><br />Rule #3  Businesses that are able to control cost well.<br />In an inflation world, revenues increase but cost also inflates. The ones that will thrive are those that can cost manage better.<br /><br />#inflation #inflationstocks<br /><br />*******<br />ðŸ”¥ JOIN our MEMBERS channel TODAY<br />â–ºâ€Œ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQAp2EzcRv2wl09p88TBrGA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQAp2EzcRv2wl09p88TBrGA/join</a><br />TIER #3 &quot;LETS MAKE A DIFFERENCE &quot; and TIER #2 &quot;PRIVATE INVESTMENT VIDEO&quot;<br />Will UNLOCK ALL VIDEOS especially those with VALUE/Momentum matrix on certain stocks!<br />TIER #1 Support our channel tier will unlock ONLY the cryptocurrency videos<br /><br />*******<br />âœ… Why you do NOT need to spend thousands on investment courses? <br />LEARN HOW to research into stocks and identify multi-baggers (at least in Josh Tan's way).
