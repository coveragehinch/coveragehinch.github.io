{% raw %}When two Toronto empty-nesters merged two condos floorplans, they asked designer Emily Griffin to help pull things together. Blush sofas and a deep teal fireplace establish a youthful palette and keep the living room punchy. The adjacent kitchen marries modern flat front cabinetry with Old World oversized porcelain tiles. Fun feathered wallpaper pops in the laundry room while global accents add richness to the spare bedroom.<br /><br />Emily Griffin, Principal, Griffin Houghton, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://griffinhoughton.com/">https://griffinhoughton.com/</a><br /><br />Sources:<br />Flooring:  6½” Torlys Everest Designer Hardwood, Coastal Oak.
