{% raw %}Volkswagen Golf 8 can be equipped with Travel Assist. This function enables assisted driving up to 210 km/h. In this process, the system relies on systems including ACC Adaptive Cruise Control (longitudinal guidance) and Lane Assist lane keeping system (latitudinal guidance). Travel Assist is activated using the multifunction steering wheel. For legal and safety-relevant reasons drivers must permanently monitor the system â€“ for this purpose, they must have at least one hand on the steering wheel. Thanks to new capacitive sensor technology in the steering wheel, it is sufficient if drivers merely touch it. However, if they let go of the steering wheel for more than 15 seconds, visual and audible warning signals and a braking jolt are issued and implemented. The driver must react by this point at the latest and touch the steering wheel, otherwise Emergency Assist is activated and the Golf is brought to a stop. I checked how Travel Assist works in a traffic jam and on a highway. Enjoy the review! :){% endraw %}
