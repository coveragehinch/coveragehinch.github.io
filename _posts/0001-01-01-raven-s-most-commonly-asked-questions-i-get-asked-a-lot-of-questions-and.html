{% raw %}I get asked a lot of questions...and I like that. I like being able to clarify things and offer my opinions and perspectives on certain topics. But there are some questions I get constantly...heck you could probably play a drinking game during my streams where you take a drink each time one of these 8 questions are asked. You might not live through the stream though.<br />So today I want to address those questions I get asked so often. <br /><br />This isn't a slight on anyone. I'm not upset nor am I mad at those who ask these. I just want the answers laid out bare so everyone can see!{% endraw %}
