{% raw %}HELLO FRIENDS!! A portion of this video was premiered during the Streamys, so thank you so much to the Streamys for featuring us! You can check out the show here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI64cM3sogg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI64cM3sogg</a><br /><br />Here is a bit of a different kind of video, the start of a new series (I hope) - where we trained as boba-ristas and then ran a boba shop for a day! We collaborated with Kung Fu Tea in Charlottesville, VA to learn how their shop operates behind the scenes, then designed a custom drink menu, and made and served people some of our curated boba selections! I’ve been a boba fan for many years, but this was my first time taking a stab at making bubble tea on my own — and though I’m not sure I have a future in the bubble tea-making profession, it was a lot of fun! What did you guys think of our drinks??<br /><br />Also, this video was filmed in early October, before the spread of Omicron &amp; I believe UVA has a vaccine requirement for their students. We made sure to comply with all mask requirements and there was a *lot* of hand washing throughout the day! Stay safe everyone!!<br /><br />This video is NOT sponsored, but thanks to Kung Fu Tea &amp; Megan for letting us film at your store!<br /><br />Check out our new merch here!! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fiendishbehavior.com/">https://fiendishbehavior.com/</a><br /><br />My Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​">https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​</a><br />My TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?">https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?</a><br />Our new livestreaming channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler">https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler</a><br />Our new YouTube Shorts channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig</a><br /><br />MUSIC<br />Via AudioNetwork<br /><br />PRODUCED &amp; EDITED by<br />Safiya Nygaard<br />Tyler Williams<br />Nez Covington<br /><br />GFX by Dayana Espinoza{% endraw %}
