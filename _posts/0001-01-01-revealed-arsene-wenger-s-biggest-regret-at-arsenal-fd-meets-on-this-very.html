{% raw %}On this very special episode of the Extra Time Podcast, Michael McCubbin chats to Christian Jeanpierre, director of Arsene Wenger: Invincible, to discuss the making of the film and Jeanpierre’s experience of knowing Wenger since his early days managing in France.  <br /><br />From his upbringing in rural Alsace, to his courageous stint in Japan and the scepticism that greeted his arrival at Arsenal in 1996, Invincible covers a lot of ground that casual fans may have otherwise not known about. But his glory years at Highbury are also well documented, with Patrick Vieira, Ian Wright, Thierry Henry and even Sir Alex Ferguson laying bare their experiences with Wenger in the early late 90s and early 2000s. Wenger also reveals his biggest regrets as Arsenal boss.  <br /><br />Should he have left North London sooner? How did the move to the Emirates effect him? And how did he cope with the pressure of the UK press? Invincible is out in UK cinemas on November 11th, and is available on other platforms from November 22nd.<br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to FOOTBALL DAILY PODCASTS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2W5ICxU">https://bit.ly/2W5ICxU</a><br />► SPOTIFY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/30bG0Q7">https://spoti.fi/30bG0Q7</a><br />► APPLE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2KaVq0K">https://apple.co/2KaVq0K</a>{% endraw %}
