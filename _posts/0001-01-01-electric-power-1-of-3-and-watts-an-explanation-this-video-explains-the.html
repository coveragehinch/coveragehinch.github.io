{% raw %}This video explains the basics of electric power and watts.  Also includes several example problems for calculating power, current, resistance and voltage.<br /><br />Electric power describes how fast electric potential energy is convert to other forms of energy such as heat, light and motion.  Power is measured in watts.  One watt is when one joule of energy is converted to another form of energy in one second.<br /><br />Please do not forget to do the following four things;<br />(1) subscribe to my channel, get ll my excellent physics, chemistry and math videos.<br />(2) give this video thumbs up.<br />(3) leave a nice positive comment in the comment section.<br />(4) sharing is caring, share this video with others to show that you care about them.<br /><br />Link for sharing; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/41-37Kv_ljw">https://youtu.be/41-37Kv_ljw</a>{% endraw %}
