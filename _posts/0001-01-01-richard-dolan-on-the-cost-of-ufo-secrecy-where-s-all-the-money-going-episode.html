{% raw %}Episode 28 - Richard discusses that the most organized and expensive government operation may be to keep the subject of UFOs secure and away from the public eye? A cost that we the citizens have to endure which Richard refers to as 'Illegal Legality'. The money spent on some kind of deeply classified structure or breakaway civilization could be in the amount of trillions of dollars. This would also include the price of security and purpose circulation of disinformation. Such secrets may not just emcompass UFO's and their occupants but very much the advanced technology they use which could help change the face of humanity and our impact on our planet.<br /><br />This channel is managed by Zohar Entertainment Group UK, Zohar Entertainment Group International Inc, USA and AdRev, USA.{% endraw %}
