It was sold in Japan as the Citro√´n Chanson, because Honda had registered the &quot;Saxo&quot; name.[1] As a badge engineered variant of the Peugeot 106 (which itself was a development of the Citro√´n AX), the major difference being interiors and body panels. Production ended in 2004, when it was replaced with the Citro√´n C2 and Citro√´n C3.<br /><br />All engines were from the PSA TU engine series that powered the Peugeot 205 from 1988 and the Citro√´n AX, and had their roots before that with the OHC PSA X engine various other PSA cars used, such as the Citro√´n Visa, Peugeot 104 and early Peugeot 205. The range included five petrol engines and one diesel engine, all naturally aspirated.<br /><br />Although the quoted power outputs are low in comparison to modern small hatchbacks, or even to other hatchbacks of the time, the kerb weight was generally very low, with even the range-topping VTS having a kerb weight of just 935 kg (2,061 lb), with other smaller engine models (except the diesel) being around 100 kg lighter than this<br /><br />There were three sport models of the Saxo:<br /><br />The Westcoast, later replaced by the Furio which featured a 1.4I 8V 55 kW (75PS/75BHP) engine with a top speed of 175 km/h (109 mph), and a 0-62.5 mph (0‚Äì100 km/h) time of 11.2 seconds.<br />The VTR MK1 (1997‚Äì1999) featured a 1.6I 8V 66 kW (90PS/89BHP) engine with a top speed of 187 km/h (116 mph) and a 0-62.5 mph (0‚Äì100 km/h) time of 10.0 seconds. The VTR MK2 (1999‚Äì2003) featured a 1.6I 8V 72 kW (98PS/97BHP) engine with a top speed of 193 km/h (120 mph) and a 0-62.5 mph (0‚Äì100 km/h) time of 9.4 seconds.<br />The VTS 16V featured a 1.6I 88 kW (120PS/118BHP) engine with a top speed of 205 km/h (127 mph), and a 0 to 60 mph time of 7.8 seconds. The VTS MK1 (1997‚Äì1999) and MK2 (1999‚Äì2003) shared similar performance, although the MK2 was slightly slower due to it being marginally heavier.<br />These models included 247 mm (9.7 in) vented front brake discs, with the VTR and VTS also having rear brake discs (solid 247 mm (9.7 in) discs). Also, a different style of control arms and struts was used for the suspension. The VTS had a 22 mm (0.9 in) master brake cylinder, and the VTR and Westcoast/Furio had a 19 mm (0.7 in).<br /><br />The VTS had a 19 mm (0.7 in) front anti roll bar and 22 mm (0.9 in) rear anti roll bar, while the VTR and Westcoast/Furio had a 19 mm (0.7 in) front and 21 mm (0.8 in) or sometimes 19 mm (0.7 in) rear antiroll bar. In addition, all the sports models featured a unique bodykit to the other models, commonly known as the &quot;VT&quot; bodykit.<br /><br />1998 Citro√´n Saxo VTS<br />Citro√´n carried on using the 1.4i engine on the facelift Saxo Automatic in 1999. Due to the C3 having a 1.4i automatic gearbox, the Saxo Automatic came to an end in March 2002, whilst the manual models were still sold right up to the end of 2003.<br /><br />Although MK2 Saxos were generally better equipped than their older counterparts, the interiors were still dated in comparison to other small hatchbacks of the time, such as the Vauxhall Corsa, with many of the center console controls originating from the older model of the Citro√´n AX.<br /><br />The 1.6L VTR and VTS Saxos were the best equipped, with both gaining rear disc brakes as opposed to drum brakes, and ABS as standard for the VTS and an optional extra on all other 1.6-liter models.<br /><br /><br />By 2003, some buyers were more attracted to the spacious, and practical five-door C3. However, the 1.6 VTR and VTS models remained popular. The Saxo finally finished production in September 2003, when the three-door C2 was launched. Its twin, the Peugeot 106, also ceased production at this time. By the end of the Saxo's production life, its design was seven years old.{% endraw %}
