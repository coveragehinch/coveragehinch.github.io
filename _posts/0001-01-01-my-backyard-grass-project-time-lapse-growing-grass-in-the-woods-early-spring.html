{% raw %}Early spring 2018 came around and I was ready to get started on the back yard which has never had anything done with it. I cleared the leaves and got my soil tests, results were not good, but I was determined to get grass to grow! 25 bags of lime, 10 bags of 12-12-12, 5 bags of Milorganite later worked into the top 3&quot; of soil and I was seeding grass. With regular watering the grass was coming in thick! I hope you enjoy the video!{% endraw %}
