Join me as I go live with you all. We have a few things to discuss. After the recent leverage shakeout, the market is still looking a little bland. However, I don’t take this as a bearish signal. On-chain metrics are still showing plenty of bullish activity. <br /><br />You all should know by now that during a bullish cycle, blood in the charts equates to discount signals. Is there a chance that we could see more downward movement in the price of #BTC during the short term? It’s quite possible. I won’t deny that. This still doesn’t change my overall sentiments towards where we’re ultimately headed. <br /><br />I will be taking advantage of every upcoming opportunity. People within the community often complain about missing out on golden opportunities. However, when the opportunities present themselves, these same people are too frozen in fear to make the proper moves. If I haven’t taught you all anything else, I hope that I have at least taught you all to not be that person. Outside of that, there are still stories of mainstream crypto adoption being reported every day.<br /><br />#Crypto.com has been killing it on the promotional front lately. We’ll discuss that and more. The chance to make life changing wealth is still upon Fam! Make sure you aren’t caught sitting on the sidelines!
