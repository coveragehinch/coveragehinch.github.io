{% raw %}OSRSGIS <br />If you work with remote sensing images from different sources - particularly from different sensors - you may encounter errors when trying to merge/stack raster data.<br />This simple tutorial shows you how to overcome such errors/difficulties using an example of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data with R.<br /><br />Feel free to ask if you have any queries.{% endraw %}
