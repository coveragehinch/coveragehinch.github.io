{% raw %}This is a very short 35-second film that was made as a group project focusing on mundane and everyday tasks. The topic we picked was reading; specifically reading Shakespeare. The video's concept was to show how reading in a mundane position such as sitting can be turned into something different and unfamiliar, by being in different positions, areas and locations.<br /><br />I was the actress that played the girl in the film.{% endraw %}
