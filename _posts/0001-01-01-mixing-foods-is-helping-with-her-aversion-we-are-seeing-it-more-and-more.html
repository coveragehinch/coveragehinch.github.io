{% raw %}We are seeing it more and more. Braylee is mixing different foods together and sometimes will eat her creations. The reason this is big for her is because not long ago, she would be bothered at even the sight of mixing foods. She first started tolerating seeing food dipped in condiments. Now, she mixes different ingredients into her Mac and Cheese. I think the key is, we don't force any new foods, let her go at her own pace with expanding to new foods, and spending time baking with her. Baking is all about mixing! <br /><br />Today is also finally the start of decorating our house for Christmas!<br />#weefam #autism<br /><br />Like this video?
