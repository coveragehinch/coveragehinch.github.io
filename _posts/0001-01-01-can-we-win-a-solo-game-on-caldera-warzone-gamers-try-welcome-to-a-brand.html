{% raw %}Welcome to a brand new show for the Gamology channel - Gamers Try, where we invite Gamers like today’s guest NaughtyAudi to play games and even set themselves challenges to show off their gaming abilities. Playing through Warzone’s new map Caldera, NaughtyAudi has set himself the challenge of winning a solo match with the side goal and beating his personal best killstreak. Follow him through 4 intense games of Warzone and see if he can beat his challenges.<br /><br />Did you enjoy this new show? Be sure to let us know in the comments!<br /><br />In addition to the &quot;Blackout&quot; mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (2018), Warzone is the second main battle royale installment in the Call of Duty franchise. Black Ops 4 relies more on equipable gadgets while Warzone focuses on accumulating an in-game currency called 'Cash' as opposed to equipable gadgets. Battle Royale and Plunder are the two key game modes in Warzone. It supports up to 150 players in a single match, which is more than what is typically seen in battle royale games.﻿<br />--------------------<br />﻿00:00 - Intro<br />﻿00:59 - 1st Try<br />﻿07:08 - 2nd Try<br />﻿11:19 - 3rd Try<br />﻿15:23 - 4th Try<br />﻿22:30 - Outro<br />--------------------<br />Check out some of our past videos!<br /><br />Spec Ops SHOOT Call Of Duty Weapons IRL (with Travis Haley) | Experts Try <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmYH2N5-qQQ&amp;t=1390s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmYH2N5-qQQ&amp;t=1390s</a><br /><br />Gamers Try playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyxcSiIY-KM&amp;list=PLGzvIvmnk2hRk2jIAT8B6raQ07On6Q_fX">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyxcSiIY-KM&amp;list=PLGzvIvmnk2hRk2jIAT8B6raQ07On6Q_fX</a><br />--------------------<br />Shout out to NaughtyAudi for the gameplay: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/audster1997">https://www.youtube.com/user/audster1997</a><br />--------------------<br />Up In My Jam (All Of A Sudden) by - Kubbi <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/kubbi">https://soundcloud.com/kubbi</a> <br />Creative Commons - Attribution 3.0 Unported- CC bY-SA 3.0 Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JnDfCE">http://bit.ly/2JnDfCE</a> <br />Music Promoted by Audio Library https: / /youtu.be/tDexBj46oNI<br />--------------------<br />Stay in the loop with us on social media!<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thebestofgam...">https://www.facebook.com/thebestofgam...</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gamology/?h...">https://www.instagram.com/gamology/?h...</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gamologyus​">https://twitter.com/gamologyus​</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our other YouTube channels:<br />Gamology Forecast - Watch out for new exciting games reviews, tips and hacks and MORE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/GamoForecast">https://bit.ly/GamoForecast</a><br />Send Noobs - If you enjoy discovering Free games and VR content, you should definitely subscribe to this channel! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SendNoobs">https://bit.ly/SendNoobs</a><br />Gamology Shorts will provide you with your daily dose of short gaming content! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/GamoShorts">https://bit.ly/GamoShorts</a><br />--------------------<br />#Warzone #Caldera #GamersTry{% endraw %}
