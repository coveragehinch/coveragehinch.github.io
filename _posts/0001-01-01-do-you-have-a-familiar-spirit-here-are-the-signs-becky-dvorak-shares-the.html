{% raw %}Becky Dvorak shares the signs of a familiar spirit and how to take authority over it.<br />▶▶Get your copy of Conquering the Spirit of Death by Becky Dvorak: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2LmdyqX">https://bit.ly/2LmdyqX</a><br /><br />Becky Dvorak is a prophetess and healing evangelist, conducting healing services, seminars, and conferences globally.<br /><br />As a prophetic healing evangelist, and an author about faith for the miraculous, she  knows that we need to tap into the supernatural power of faith to receive our healings, but first we must learn how to believe. And she’s here to teach us how to do just that– believe and receive our miracles, and then release this supernatural power to others.<br /><br />Along with her husband, David, they have been full-time missionaries since 1994, in Guatemala, Central America, founders of Healing and Miracles International, and Vida Ilimitada, and have founded Life Tender Mercy Homes in Guatemala for children that are abandoned, orphaned, and/or born with the HIV virus.<br /><br />It is here, at Life Tender Mercy Homes in Guatemala where the Holy Spirit taught her how to heal the sick, raise the dead, and set the captives free. And from here He began to call her to the Nations.<br /><br />They celebrate 40 years of marriage, have 8 children, 3 adult biological and 5 adopted,  1 son-in-law, 4 daughters-in-law and 11 grandchildren, and live in Arizona, U.S.A.{% endraw %}
