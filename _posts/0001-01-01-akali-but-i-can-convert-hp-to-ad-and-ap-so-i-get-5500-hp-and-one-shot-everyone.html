{% raw %}The perfect hybrid Akali build to be a tank mage assassin adc bruiser moral supporting menace.<br />Through items we can convert bonus HP to AD and AP so I built those alongside a lot of health and penetration to be super tanky and also still deal ridiculous damage. This build was actually pretty fun to play, hope you enjoy it too!<br /><br />Runes: Resolve - Grasp of the Undying, Demolish, Conditioning, Overgrowth<br />Precision - Presence of Mind (probably change to Triumph), Coup de Grace<br />Secondaries - AD, AD, Armor<br /><br />Remember to 'Like' and Subscribe if you enjoy the video!
