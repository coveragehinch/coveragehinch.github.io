{% raw %}With 2,774 miles logged at the midpoint of December, it's time to go over my favorite shoes from 2021. There were so many good ones, and to help narrow down the field, I'll be choosing my favorites in each of five categories of running shoes.<br /><br />0:00 intro<br />1:30 disclosures<br />2:29 marathon shoes<br />4:14 daily trainer<br />5:19 max cushion<br />6:34 speed shoes<br />7: 41 trail shoes<br /><br />caveat: I've been very careful to note that these are my favorite shoes, and not necessarily the &quot;best&quot; shoes, whatever you subjectively and/or idiosyncratically may interpret that word to mean. that being said, I'd love to hear what have been your favorite shoes to run in.<br /><br />disclosures: while I do buy a significant number of my own shoes, all of the shoes mentioned in this video were provided to me by someone at some point during the year. I have also made some collaboration content with Hoka and ASICS over the course of this year for use on this channel. Some of the travel required for those collaborations has been expenses paid, some of it was on my own dime. <br />No one is paying me to make this video or to include their shoe in a video. No one has previewed any of this video edit or my thoughts before this video has gone up on YouTube. <br /><br />Thanks for watching!
