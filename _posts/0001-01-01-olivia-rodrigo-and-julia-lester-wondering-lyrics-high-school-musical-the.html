{% raw %}Title: Wondering<br />By: Olivia Rodrigo and Julia Lester<br />♬Lyrics♬<br />Seems like a part of me will always have to lose<br />Every single time I have to choose<br />Swore that it felt right, but was I wrong?<br />Is this where I'm supposed to be at all?<br /><br />I don't have the answers, not today<br />It's like nothing makes the questions go away<br />What I'd give to see<br />If the grass was greener<br /><br />On the other side of all I've had and lost<br />Would it be enough?<br />Or would I still be wondering?<br /><br />If I could go back and change the past<br />Be a little braver than I had<br />And bet against the odds<br />Would I still be lost?<br />Even if I woke up in my dreams<br />Would there still be something I'm missing?<br />If I had everything<br />Would it mean anything to me?<br />Ooh<br /><br />Feels like I might have broke the best thing that I had<br />I said too much to ever take it back<br />Scared I'll never find something as good<br />And would I even know it if I could?<br />From the other side of all I've had and lost<br />Would it be enough?<br />Or would I still be wondering?<br />Or would I still be wondering? Oh<br /><br />If I could go back and change the past<br />Be a little braver than I had<br />And bet against the odds<br />Would I still be lost?<br />Even if I woke up in my dreams<br />Would there still be something I'm missing?<br />If I had everything<br />Would it mean anything?<br /><br />Maybe I should turn around and take the other road<br />Or maybe I'm just looking for what I already know<br />I'm just wondering<br /><br />If I could go back and change the past<br />Be a little braver than I had<br />And bet against the odds<br />Would I still be lost?<br /><br />Even if I woke up in my dreams<br />Would there still be something I'm missing?<br />If I had everything<br />Would it mean anything to me?<br />Would it be enough?<br />Or would I still be wondering?<br /><br />#wondering #HighSchoolMusicalTheMusicalTheSeries<br /><br />I do not own anything.
