{% raw %}Got a replacement axe for myself for the two Gransfors axes that I gave away to my sons-in-law. This one is the 19&quot; Small Forest Axe, open box and desktop review. I looked up the smith who made this axe. It is &quot;CS&quot; for Sj√∂lund Christian. Good job Christian! This axe is warrantied for 20 years.{% endraw %}
