In addition, we’ll offer tips on how to avoid common errors in your Ranges code, and demonstrate a couple of useful utility functions which you can drop into your codebase today.<br /><br />---<br />Tristan Brindle<br />C++ London Uni<br /><br />---<br />Streamed &amp; Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk<br />events@digital-medium.co.uk <br /><br />*-----*<br />The CppCon YouTube Channel Is Sponsored By:<br />JetBrains : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jb.gg/cpptools">http://jb.gg/cpptools</a> <br />SonarSource:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sonarsource.com/">https://www.sonarsource.com/</a><br />*-----*{% endraw %}
