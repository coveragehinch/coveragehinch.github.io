{% raw %}The newest Canadian IMP is lighter in weight, yet packs in just as many calories as ever. This Pulled Pork, menu #12 is absolutely fantastic. With 39 grams of protein to the main course, it's very sustaining and truly delectable in it's quality. Gotta say, this is a menu worth looking for! <br /><br />Currently editing an exciting review of a never before filmed US survival ration from 1957. So stay tuned for that. Had to eat a little something normal for in between, so for the folks out there who like their food a bit fresher, this one's for you. Alright cool, see ya.<br /><br />For correspondence, or to send a Military Ration for review, my exact mailing information is: <br />Steve1989<br />3616 Harden Blvd<br />360<br />Lakeland, FL 33803 <br /><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2821334&amp;ty=h">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2821334&amp;ty=h</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/steve1989">https://teespring.com/stores/steve1989</a>{% endraw %}
