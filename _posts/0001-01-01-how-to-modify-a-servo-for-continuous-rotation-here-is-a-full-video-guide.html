{% raw %}Here is a full video guide to modifying a Turnigy TG9e Analogue Micro Servo for continuous rotation. Modifying a servo for continuous rotation opens up a number of possibilities for new Arduino projects, the modified servos essentially function as a PWM variable speed and direction motor which can easily be controlled by an Arduino or similar micro controller.<br /><br />The process is very similar for other servo models and different sized servos.<br /><br />Visit this link for the full guide along with purchase links for the tools and materials - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.the-diy-life.com/how-to-modify-a-servo-for-continuous-rotation/">http://www.the-diy-life.com/how-to-modify-a-servo-for-continuous-rotation/</a>{% endraw %}
