You’ll also learn:<br />- the difference between knowledge, truth, belief and commitment,<br />- the Four Great Questions of Life,<br />- how lack of knowledge affects our worldview and our education system,<br />- the gospel of Jesus in this context.<br /><br />Key Scriptures: Hosea 4:6; Daniel 12:4; John 17:3; 2 Peter 3:18 <br /><br />Learn about the book, &quot;Knowing Christ Today&quot; on our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dwillard.org/books/knowing-christ-today">https://dwillard.org/books/knowing-christ-today</a>{% endraw %}
