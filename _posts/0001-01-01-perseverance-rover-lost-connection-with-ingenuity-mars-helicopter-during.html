{% raw %}On December 5, 2021 NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter completed 17th flight on Red Planet but lost connection with Perseverance Rover during landing. After a successful traverse to the northeast, the radio communications link between Ingenuity &amp; Perseverance Mars Rover was disrupted during landing. The rover later received telemetry suggesting Ingenuity. Nasa’s Ingenuity operation engineers are understood this situation and will try to solve it in upcoming flights. Technically there may be consequences after difficulties detected at 17 flight.<br /><br />Credit: nasa.gov, NASA/JPL-Caltech, NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU<br /><br />Source for Ingenuity Flight 17 connection issue: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/26397/orientation-of-mars-helicopter-base-station-antenna-for-flight-17/">https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/26397/orientation-of-mars-helicopter-base-station-antenna-for-flight-17/</a><br /><br />Source for Perseverance’s latest image of Ingenuity Helicopter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/ZL0_0279_0691721516_144EBY_N0080064ZCAM08294_1100LMJ">https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/ZL0_0279_0691721516_144EBY_N0080064ZCAM08294_1100LMJ</a><br /><br />#mars #helicopter #ingenuity{% endraw %}
