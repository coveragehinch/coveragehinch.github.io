Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving...<br /><br />Just make sure you don't forget to breathe.<br /><br />• Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive<br />• It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations<br />• Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics<br />• Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations<br />• Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations<br />• Always Keep Yourself Breathing<br />• Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling<br />• Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds<br /><br />The 'Unexplained Traits' update has dropped for Oxygen Not Included!<br /><br />This update reintroduces the world traits system to Spaced Out!<br />This means that each planetoid in the cluster gets a few randomly selected traits to modify the world generation algorithm and mix up the play experience. There are over 20 different traits that may be selected: some old, some new. Some worlds will not be affected at all.<br /><br />We’ve also upgraded the frigid “Rime” cluster to be compatible with Spaced Out! You can now find Rime in the “Classic” destination category when you start a new game.<br /><br />We’ve also added four new Spaced Out! centric Duplicant traits. You might notice some Duplicants now have space specific traits, and some give off a bit of a glow...<br /><br />Additionally, we’ve added several new Spaced Out! specific Achievements. You can check them out in the ‘Colony Summary’ screen. <br /><br /><br />Check out Oxygen Not Included on Steam!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/</a><br /><br />- - - - -<br /><br />#Blitz #OxygenNotIncluded{% endraw %}
