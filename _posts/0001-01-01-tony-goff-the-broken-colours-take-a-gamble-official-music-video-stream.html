We all have struggles and want to give in at times, it's a little reminder to say. You got this!<br /><br />&quot;The influences brought to this song are from artists such as Jamrioquai, Vulfpeck and Ripe. As we grow as musicians we have fallen into a more soulful indie vibe. This isn't our old sound. But over the pandemic we restructured and released our 2020 funk offering 'Rearrange'. Members changed, and so did the flow. This track is a taster of our forthcoming EP, full of indie soulful funk!&quot;<br /><br />------------------------<br /><br />Recorded by - Free Fall Studios <br />Produced - Paul Frost <br />Mastered - Sonomax <br />Video Credit - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.whitelizardproductions.com">http://www.whitelizardproductions.com</a><br /><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/tgbcofficialuk">http://www.facebook.com/tgbcofficialuk</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/tgbcofficialuk">http://www.instagram.com/tgbcofficialuk</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/tonygoffmusic">http://www.twitter.com/tonygoffmusic</a><br />YouTube - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/tonygoffmusic">http://www.youtube.com/tonygoffmusic</a><br /><br />Spotify - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/39Flm11">https://spoti.fi/39Flm11</a><br />Apple Music - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/36FP8Rt">https://apple.co/36FP8Rt</a>{% endraw %}
