{% raw %}Marc invites a robber and a milkmaid into our home for Christmas... <br />******<br />We could really do with both a boost at the moment and there are several things that you can do to help: <br />1. Watch the adverts. (We don't choose them, the algorithm does. But this is how we get our income).<br />2. Subscribe to our channel (YouTube is more likely to promote us if we have more followers). <br />3. Like and comment on our videos. (Even just an emoji! Also helps YouTube know what to promote!)<br />4. Spread the word - send it to your friends and family! <br />5. Follow us on instagram and facebook (links below) <br />6. If you want to see more videos and be part of a lovely community, please join us on Patreon. The standard tier is 3.50 euros a month or its equivalent in your currency. We produce between four and six extra videos a month, plus other posts, and we really open up our hearts and home in a way we can't do in public. <br />Links: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Chateaurosieres">https://www.patreon.com/Chateaurosieres</a> <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.chateaurosieres.com">https://www.chateaurosieres.com</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chateaurosieres/">https://www.instagram.com/chateaurosieres/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/chateaurosieres/">https://www.facebook.com/chateaurosieres/</a> <br />Also a closed facebook group called 'The Chronicles of Rosieres' where we discuss the YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1111629642596547/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1111629642596547/</a><br /><br />#chateau #traditional #france #family #christmas{% endraw %}
