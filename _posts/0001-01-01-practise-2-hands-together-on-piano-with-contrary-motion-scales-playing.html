{% raw %}Playing piano or keyboard with two hands together is one of the biggest challenges learners face â€” playing with either left or right hand by itself is relatively easy, but once the hands have to work together things can get challenging, fast. <br /><br />The single best type of exercise for improving your hand independence on piano or keyboard is contrary motion. You can practise contrary motion using scales or broken chords, and it's massively effective at getting both hands working at the same time because it's regular and controlled, but both hands are doing something different throughout the whole exercise.<br /><br />In this video I demonstrate a C major contrary motion scale and an F major contrary motion broken chord. If you want to push you hand independence skills even further, try going faster, playing over more octaves, or playing the exercises with both hands in harder keys with more black notes.<br /><br />By the way, if you're interested in other strategies that will help you get your hands working together better on the keyboard, I have a full tutorial on the subject here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5w5Tgb6pJeM">https://youtu.be/5w5Tgb6pJeM</a><br /><br />#Shorts #Piano{% endraw %}
