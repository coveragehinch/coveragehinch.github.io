{% raw %}Some mysterious vanishings are very unusual in just how sudden and without warning they come. There have been those cases in which people have just seemingly gone up in a puff of smoke, leaving few clues as to what has happened to them and a blank space where they should have been. One of such cases comes from somewhere in the world, where an experienced hiker sat down one day to fade out of existence without a trace.<br />Please contact me if you know something about these disappearances. Thank you so much!<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Chapters:<br />00:10 1. Serenity Dennard<br />04:12 2.
