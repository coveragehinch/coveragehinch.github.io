{% raw %}When we have a clean heart and understand how the law of 'action' truly works, we have the best chance of enjoying the game of life, and all the consequences we bring back to ourselves. When we understand the actions of 'humanity' as a whole we can see the consequences of these on our dear planet and why people and governments across the globe are now seeking to address the need to change our habits and actions so the earth can flourish again.<br /><br />Raja Yoga Master Sister Shivani will explain how this journey starts within each individual spirit and how now is the time to strengthen our inner being so we can align our actions with our original benevolence. The afternoon also includes a question and answer session with Sister Shivani on this fascinating topic, facilitated by Samantha Fraser.<br /><br />Sister Shivani is a practitioner of Raja Yoga Meditation of the Brahma Kumaris for over 22 years.
