We miss travelling and we know you do too, so we are bringing on some travel adventures in Taiwan! Taiwan is blessed with tons of authentic street food from other countries and today we are taking you on a street food tour with HONG KONG’s best street food. <br />We start our Cantonese street food tour at a traditional morning market that we heard was the general location for a man with a Cheong Fun stall. We didn’t know the address, we only knew that he was open on Fridays. He makes his Cheong fun by pouring rice flour onto a metal tray. He adds your toppings like shrimp, egg and lettuce and puts it into the steam tower. Once cooked, he scrapes it into messy rolls. So delicious! (130 NTD / USD $4.34) <br />An important part of Hong Kong’s food culture is brunch with tea, or “Yum Cha”. Gathering around a table with family and friends, sharing tea and eating dim sum is what Yum Cha is all about. At this authentic restaurant, the dim sum carts are constantly circulating with fresh and hot steam baskets. We ordered the classics: har gao, shui mai, meatballs, char siu bao, egg tarts and MORE! Total meal cost 616 NTD (USD $20.56). <br />Roasted meats hanging in windows dot the streets of Hong Kong and you can find that here in Taiwan too! We went to a shop that is frequented by taxi drivers and is famous for their signature 3 Treasure Meats dish. We ordered roast duck, BBQ pork, roast chicken, sausages and siu yuk chopped up before your eyes! It was served alongside rice, and seasonal vegetables. It wasn’t the best version of Cantonese roast meats. The price of the meal came to 150 NTD (USD $5.01).<br />Afternoon tea in Hong Kong was influenced by the British, which means local cafes or Cha Chaan Teng serving sweet teas and even sweeter desserts. There are many authentic Cha Chaan Teng in Taiwan as well! We visited a spot that was decked out in Hong Kong memorabilia, including street signs, pop culture posters and iconic brandings like Carnation, Ovaltine and more. We ordered the Pineapple Bun, French Toast, Lemon Tea and HK Milk Tea. The total cost was 255 NTD (USD $8.51). <br />We wanted to finish the crazy day of eating Hong Kong food in Taiwan with a traditional dessert. We visited a Hong Kong dessert chain and ordered a Walnut and Sesame paste soup. It’s served hot and is not too sweet. The flavours and textures are exactly like the one we had in Hong Kong last year! The bowl cost 105 NTD (USD $3.50). <br />Restaurant Info <br />Cheong Fun at Guangdong Rice Rolls  (in Binjiang Market) <br />No. 6, Alley 2, Lane 410, Minzu East Road, Zhongshan District, Taipei  <br />Yum Cha / Dim Sum at Brother Hotel Plum Blossom Room<br />No. 255, Section 3, Nanjing East Road, Songshan District, Taipei <br />Roasted Meats at 香港裕記燒臘<br />No. 170, Long Jiang Rd, Zhongshan District, Taipei <br />Afternoon Tea at Boji HK Style Restaurant<br />No. 8, Lane 70, Yanji Street, Da’an District, Taipei <br />Hong Kong Dessert at 佳佳甜品<br />No. 145-2, Section 1, Keelung Rd, Xinyi District, Taipei <br />If you liked this video, subscribe to this channel!
