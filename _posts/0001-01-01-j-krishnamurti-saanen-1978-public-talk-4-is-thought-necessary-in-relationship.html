{% raw %}Saanen 1978 - Public Talk 4 - Is thought necessary in relationship?<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Thought is never free, it is limited in all circumstances.<br /><br />Is relationship a movement of identification?<br /><br />Is it possible in your daily relationships with each other not to register insult or flattery? <br /><br />Through identification with another are you escaping from yourself?<br /><br />When you strip yourself of conclusions, words and experience, you are nothing, you are empty. <br /><br />Can the mind observe emptiness and not move away from it? <br /><br />Is it possible to have no fear whatsoever, physically and psychologically?<br /><br />When you watch closely, without any movement of thought, direction, motive, trying to change or go beyond, the thing that you are watching undergoes a fundamental change.<br /><br />---<br /><br />This channel is managed by the Krishnamurti Foundation Trust​​, UK​, and by the Krishnamurti Foundation of America.<br /><br />The role of the foundations was described by Krishnamurti when he said,​ ​'The foundations will see to it that these teachings are kept whole, are not distorted, are not made corrupt. They will not give rise to any sectarian spirit in their activities... nor create any kind of place of worship around the teachings or the person.​'​<br /><br />We maintain extensive archives of Krishnamurti's original works and all four Krishnamurti foundations are actively engaged in the publication of material in various forms.<br /><br />Our videos contain thousands of subtitles in more than 25 languages, translated by volunteers from all over the world. If you would like to help us with translating subtitles, please contact us at digital@kfoundation.org<br /><br />For more information about J.
