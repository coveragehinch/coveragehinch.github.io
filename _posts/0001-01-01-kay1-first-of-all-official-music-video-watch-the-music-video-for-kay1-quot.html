/>When I wake up in the morning tell myself go get it<br />When I come up to the spot you can see who did it<br />And I came up from the bottom you can see we in it<br />I'll put you on hold cause my call ain't finished<br />I got so much on the line you gotta wait a minute<br />And I gotta let em know that I'm making my image<br />I'm so much on the grind they should put me in Guinnes<br /><br />[Hook]<br /><br />Shawty fuckin' with a real one she won't believe me<br />I'ma fuck her and I leave some she can feel me<br />Realest boy you ever seen yeah I think she sees me<br />Shawty getting them feels yeah she won't leave me<br />I'll be rather on my grind so I'm seeing VVS<br />When I look up for the time diamonds dancing freaky<br />Now I gotta take what's mine so you gotta let me<br />She was lookin' so fine but she didn't get me<br /><br />[Verse 1]<br /><br />If she doesn't run with me then it ain't my type<br />Yeah I'm coming from the 23 fuck a 45<br />Got my vision on my bag got a mission in my life<br />Gotta listen to a youngin' I'm not all about the likes<br />I know she likes my fashion I know she likes my vibe<br />But how long is it lasting it doesn't feel right<br />I'm grindin' for a mansion baby sit tight<br />You can't handle all the tension did you even try<br />I gotta tell her goodbye I really was a nice guy<br />Baby know I won't lie she leavin' at a night time<br />Gotta stay on my grind brothers feel like blood line<br />I Keep it on the left lane comin' from the north side<br />I keep it on the gogo everything but slo mo<br />I do things you don't know I leave it on the low low<br />Busy on the phone phone fuck her then I go prone<br />What I dream I will own runnin' to the end zone<br /><br />[Pre Hook]<br /><br />First of all I'ma start with this<br />When I wake up in the morning tell myself go get it<br />When I come up to the spot you can see who did it<br />And I came up from the bottom you can see we in it<br />I'll put you on hold cause my call ain't finished<br />I got so much on the line you gotta wait a minute<br />And I gotta let em know that I'm making my image<br />I'm so much on the grind they should put me in Guinnes<br /><br />[Hook]<br /><br />Shawty fuckin' with a real one she won't believe me<br />I'ma fuck her and I leave some she can feel me<br />Realest boy you ever seen yeah I think she sees me<br />Shawty getting them feels yeah she won't leave me<br />I'll be rather on my grind so I'm seeing VVS<br />When I look up for the time diamonds dancing freaky<br />Now I gotta take what's mine so you gotta let me<br />She was lookin' so fine but she didn't get me<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br /><br />Since a youngin' on the run I was settled on an island<br />Never seen a gun later on I met the violence<br />You gotta see it all before life is getting timeless<br />Bags to the mall really wanna be the flyest<br />I feel like Travis in the room when they see me I'm the highest<br />Drippin' for days when I come I change the climate<br />Phone goes off gotta take another client<br />I will take it to the moon this star will shine the brightest<br />At the end she wanna sit in a Porsche 4 door<br />Baby I can tell you that I need 4 more<br />Take the roof off the coupe I can feel the G-Force<br />So much on my plate it's not even main course<br />Sushi or a steak yeah I pay what I'm here for<br />Don't you be amazed I think it's the year for<br />Gucci, Cartier she knows what I'm in for<br />Don't you get insane I think I'm getting in form<br />First things first If we make a deal I keep a third<br />I really need my car go skrt we make it skrt<br />Nowadays we gotta be insured<br />Really makin' sure that the money won't burn<br />See me in designer I stay pure<br />They see that the money still talks to her<br />She just wants the guala in her purse<br />She's gonna fuck it up for sure<br /><br />[Pre Hook]<br /><br />First of all I'ma start with this<br />When I wake up in the morning tell myself go get it<br />When I come up to the spot you can see who did it<br />And I came up from the bottom you can see we in it<br />I'll put you on hold cause my call
