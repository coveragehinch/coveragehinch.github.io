{% raw %}I was a child<br />I was on fire<br />but I stayed alive while all else died<br />I held my breath<br />what could I say<br />and I closed my eyes like marvin gaye<br />but now I've had enough<br />it's in the drugs<br />it's in the drugs<br />it's in the drugs, ahhh<br />it's in the drugs<br /><br />you had your plan<br />a heavy hand<br />but the weight was more than you could stand<br />breaking like dolls<br />singing like birds<br />we always get what we deserve<br />but now I've had enough<br />it's in the drugs<br />it's in the drugs{% endraw %}
