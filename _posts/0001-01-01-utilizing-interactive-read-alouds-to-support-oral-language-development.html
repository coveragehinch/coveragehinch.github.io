{% raw %}Reading aloud to children is a critical component of supporting their oral language development. When teachers regularly engage children in interactive read-alouds, including holding conversations before and after book-reading, children have opportunities to practice their oral language skills. <br />See <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.easternct.edu/center-for-early-childhood-education/oral-language-development/interactive-read-alouds.html">https://www.easternct.edu/center-for-early-childhood-education/oral-language-development/interactive-read-alouds.html</a> for additional resources and related videos.<br /><br />Copyright 2015 by the center for Early Childhood Education at Eastern Connecticut State University.
