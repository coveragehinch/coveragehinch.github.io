It has characteristics of both a fat and a carbohydrate, but it's not either. Ketones come from fat, and they are an alternative fuel source. You get ketones by lowering the carbohydrates in your diet, or by reducing your frequency of eating. <br /><br />That's why I recommend a low carb diet (ketogenic diet) with intermittent fasting. That way, you can maximize your ability to make ketones. <br /><br />Benefits of ketones:<br /><br /> • Increases oxygen in the body<br /> • Increases energy<br /> • Supports the brain <br /> • Supports the heart <br /><br />Most of the body tissues can run on ketones, but some parts need glucose. However, you still don't need to consume glucose. Your body can make glucose when it needs to through something called gluconeogenesis. <br /><br />It takes time to start turning fat into ketones. The time it takes depends on how damaged your pancreas is. <br /><br />How to get into ketosis: <br /><br /> • Lower your carbs<br /> • Lower your frequency of eating<br /><br />Why should you do ketosis?<br /><br /> • To lower insulin<br /><br />High insulin levels cause insulin resistance. <br /><br />Insulin resistance in behind:<br /><br /> • Pre-diabetes<br /> • Diabetes<br /> • Metabolic syndrome<br /> • High blood pressure<br /> • Fat in the gut area<br /><br />More benefits of keto and intermittent fasting:<br /><br /> • Reduce fat in the liver<br /> • Improve cognitive performance <br /> • Improve mood<br /> • Decrease blood pressure<br /> • Decrease inflammation <br /> • Improve energy<br /> • Decrease belly fat <br /> • Autophagy <br /><br />* Your hunger goes away with the keto diet and intermittent fasting. <br /><br />* Keto and intermittent fasting work best when combined. <br /><br />* I recommend healthy keto over dirty keto. <br /><br />* Don't eat unless you're hungry. With healthy keto, you will be full and satisfied. <br /><br />* Autophagy starts after about 18 hours of fasting.<br /><br />* When fasting drink fluids, take electrolytes and B vitamins, and take sea salt. <br /><br />Common foods to focus on while on the ketogenic diet plan: <br /><br /> • Pasture-raised eggs<br /> • Shellfish <br /> • Fish <br /> • Sardines<br /> • Organic meats <br /> • Cheese <br /> • Olives <br /> • Avocados <br /> • Veggies <br /> • Nuts <br /> • Seeds <br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:<br />Dr. Berg, 56 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
