{% raw %}The Earth is our home and it feels like it has been here forever and will always be there. However, it's not so easy and safe in space, and it looks like the Milky Way is at risk!<br /><br />Astronomers believe that in 4.5 billion years, a powerful galactic collision will occur. The Milky Way galaxy, which is the home to our Solar System and the very planet we live on, will collide with the Andromeda Galaxy. The good news is that the collisions, and the potential appearance of a quasar, will have no effect on our planet! What's more, even the quasar's radiation won't manage to disturb the peace of the Solar System.<br /><br />Other videos you might like:<br />A Mysterious Object Punched a Hole in the Milky Way, Scientists Are Confused<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_iJsEdhFgzc">https://youtu.be/_iJsEdhFgzc</a><br />Stephen Hawking’s 7 Predictions of Earth’s Demise in the Next 200 Years<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Lq9wipOftXw">https://youtu.be/Lq9wipOftXw</a><br />The Solar System Is Not Like You Think It Is<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-FvpAe3MacM">https://youtu.be/-FvpAe3MacM</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />The release of the most detailed map of the Milky Way 0:38<br />A new galaxy was discovered 1:12<br />The mystery of Antlia 2 2:43<br />There was a collision 1 billion years ago 3:48<br />The future collision 5:17<br />The dramatic results of a collision 6:38<br />Will it really happen? 7:38<br /><br />#spacefacts #brightside #milkyway<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />-In 2018, the European Space Agency finally released the most detailed map of the Milky Way galaxy.<br />-A new galaxy orbiting the Milky Way that was named Antlia 2 was discovered thanks to the powerful telescope.<br />-A new study claimed that the very same Antlia 2 is responsible for bizarre ripples disturbing the hydrogen gas in the Milky Way's outer disc. <br />-It seems that over time, the Milky Way has absorbed loads of the material Antlia 2 consists of when the two collided about 1 billion years ago.<br />-There might be not one, but two galactic collisions; and the first is likely to happen around 2 billion years from now, when the Milky Way collides with the Large Magellanic Cloud. <br />-All the constellations, as we know them, will disappear from the sky, but the potential appearance of a quasar, will have no effect on our planet.<br />-The chances of several stars colliding during the galaxies' merge are really low because stars are located too far away from each other.<br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
