{% raw %}Song off of &quot;The Eventually Home&quot; album by Andy Hull's Right Away, Great Captain!<br /><br /><br /><br />In no way do I own the rights to this song. Manchester Orchestra and their label own the rights to this.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />I will get you. <br /><br />You will pay, I hope you know. <br /><br />I am a vampire to you. <br /><br />I will sneak up and get you. <br /><br />I'm bad.<br /><br /><br /><br />And I was afraid. <br /><br />I will see who I was. <br /><br />You were the child that I once knew. <br /><br />I am a saint; I will haunt you at night. <br /><br />I am the dog that you feed. <br /><br />Won't you feed on me?{% endraw %}
