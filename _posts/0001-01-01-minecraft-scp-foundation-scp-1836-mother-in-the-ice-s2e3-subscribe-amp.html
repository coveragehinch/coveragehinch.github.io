The head north from the south pole to the northern arctic circle where they search for the culprit. <br /><br />Cory, Trianna and Hooper sail through the arctic waters searching for the illusive SCP. Cory decides to try his hand at fishing, and rather than catching a seal, catches the iceberg that slams into the boat. Trianna orders Cory to board the iceberg and alas he is marooned on it. He falls through the ice and is face to face with the Mother in the Ice inside the iceberg. They discuss her reasoning for protecting her people's waters. <br /><br />When Hooper and Trianna catch wind of the berg, they trap it in a harbor. Cory escapes narrowly, but not without a lesson in mind. Avoiding hypothermia, he gets warmed up on the boat...but starts to question his place in this war between the agency and SCP's.{% endraw %}
