Only one centrist candidate won a seat in a revamped Legco, after traditional opposition parties stayed out of the race. It was the first Legco poll since Beijing’s overhaul of Hong Kong’s electoral system to ensure that only “patriots” could run for office. Voter turnout was the lowest since Britain handed the city back to China in 1997 at 30.2 per cent, compared to 58 per cent in the most recent Legco vote in 2016. <br /><br />(Photo: Robert Ng)<br /><br />Related story:<br />As it happened: 1.3 million voters cast ballots in Hong Kong Legco election <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sc.mp/64tl">https://sc.mp/64tl</a><br /><br />Support us:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://subscribe.scmp.com">https://subscribe.scmp.com</a><br /><br />Follow us on:<br />Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scmp.com">https://www.scmp.com</a><br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/scmp">https://facebook.com/scmp</a><br />Twitter:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/scmpnews">https://twitter.com/scmpnews</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/scmpnews">https://instagram.com/scmpnews</a><br />Linkedin:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/south-china-morning-post/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/south-china-morning-post/</a><br /><br />#scmp #SCMPOriginals #HongKongLegislativeCouncilelection2021{% endraw %}
