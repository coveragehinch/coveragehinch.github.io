{% raw %}In this ridiculously long and detailed video, I'll take you behind-the-scenes of my YouTube channel and various businesses to show how much money we've made in 2021. Please do take the trigger warning at the start into account and please also understand that this is not an overnight success story, and there's no (legit) way to make money online without large amounts of work, luck and unfair advantages, of which I've had plenty.<br /><br />If you've got any questions, chuck them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer. <br /><br />🧠 The Part-Time YouTuber Academy - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academy.aliabdaal.com">https://academy.aliabdaal.com</a><br /><br />PS: This is all pre-tax revenue, and it goes into a company account which I then pay 21 team members, lots of money for various contractors, consultants and coaches, and an obscene amount of money for various software subscriptions etc. The money then gets corporation taxed. Personally, I don't withdraw very much each year and when I do, I get hit with 37.5% dividend tax and 9% student loan repayments. So this &quot;top line business revenue&quot; has very little association with the numbers on my personal bank account, in case you're trying to estimate my personal net worth from this video. Maybe I'll talk about that some other time, but yeah - please don't rush to any conclusions from this video on that front :) <br /><br />Timestamps - <br />00:00 Intro<br />01:54 Twitch<br />02:54 Working as a doctor<br />03:22 Mentor for BASB<br />03:47 Real-estate<br />04:43 Nebula<br />05:11 Podcast sponsorships<br />06:40 Stocks and shares<br />10:20 Book deal<br />12:00 Crypto<br />15:15 Affiliate income<br />17:37 YouTube AdSense<br />19:56 Sponsorships<br />22:46 Skillshare<br />26:08 PTYA<br /><br />MY FREE ONLINE COURSES:<br />🚀  Productivity Masterclass - Principles and Tools to Boost Your Productivity - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.aliabdaal.com/course/productivity">https://go.aliabdaal.com/course/productivity</a><br />🎬  Video Editing with Final Cut Pro X - From Beginner to YouTuber - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.aliabdaal.com/course/video-editing">https://go.aliabdaal.com/course/video-editing</a><br />🎓  How to Study for Exams - An Evidence-Based Masterclass - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.aliabdaal.com/course/studying">https://go.aliabdaal.com/course/studying</a><br /><br />PART-TIME YOUTUBER ACADEMY:<br />🍿 My 6-week live online course - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academy.aliabdaal.com">https://academy.aliabdaal.com</a><br /><br />MY FAVOURITE GEAR:<br />🎥  My YouTube Camera Gear - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/AliAbdaal">https://kit.co/AliAbdaal</a><br />⌨️  My Keyboard - Wireless Coral mechanical keyboard (Cherry Blue) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.aliabdaal.com/keyboard">https://go.aliabdaal.com/keyboard</a> <br />📝  My favourite iPad Screen Protector - Paperlike - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.aliabdaal.com/paperlike">https://go.aliabdaal.com/paperlike</a> <br />🎒 My Desk Accessories + Todo List - Ugmonk - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.aliabdaal.com/ugmonk">https://go.aliabdaal.com/ugmonk</a><br /><br />MY FAVOURITE SOFTWARE:<br />✍️ The best summaries of books (Shortform) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.aliabdaal.com/shortform">https://go.aliabdaal.com/shortform</a><br />📚  How I remember what I read (Readwise) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.aliabdaal.com/readwise">https://go.aliabdaal.com/readwise</a> <br />🎵  Where I get my Music (amazing for YouTubers) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.aliabdaal.com/epidemicsound">https://go.aliabdaal.com/epidemicsound</a><br /><br />🎙 My weekly podcast - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.notoverthinking.com">https://www.notoverthinking.com</a><br />My brother and I host a weekly podcast where we discuss happiness, creativity and the human condition.
