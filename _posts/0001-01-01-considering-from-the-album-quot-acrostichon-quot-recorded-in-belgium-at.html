{% raw %}From the album &quot;Acrostichon&quot; - Recorded in Belgium at  the 24-track Just Born Recording Studio's June 1977 - Engineer: Luc Ardyns<br /><br />From the Album - Acrostichon<br /><br />ISOPODA was often considered as Belgium Seventies best Progressive band. It plays a superb sophisticated and melodious Progressive rock, based upon the combinations between vovals, guitar, keyboards and flute. Working such as a goldsmith, ISOPODA composes pieces with a rare perfection, which could equal to the best GENESIS, enhanced by somptuous vocals and arrangements.<br /><br /><br /><br />On this album issued in 1978, this Belgian band performed an elegant Progressive with elaborated arrangements. They played refined melodies with wonderful vocals, nice flute &amp; guitar parts. The GENESIS and Alan PARSONS' references are obvious: liking for velvet and refined melodies, which thanks to their fluidity, delicate accoustic parts and beauty, seduce the auditor.{% endraw %}
