Shake and strain into a coupe glass. Garnish with a lime wheel.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨<br /><br />The Cosmopolitan is the only classic cocktail that was invented in the last 20 years, but it has suffered a little bit of a negative connotation lately, and I think that's due to a certain HBO show about four women going to brunch. But I'm going to go out on limb and defend the Cosmopolitan, because I think it is a great cocktail, and I have to give it serious props because without the Cosmopolitan getting so popular, who knows if cocktail culture would have reemerged the way it has in the first place. So we have to pay our respects to the Cosmopolitan. And the good news is when it's made properly with fresh ingredients it's actually a really delicious cocktail. <br /><br />So we're going to start with two ounces of lemon vodka or citrus vodka, and a little orange liquer, Quantro is a great option for that, three-quarters of an ounce. You'll see a lot of versions of this recipe. This is the one I like to do, I'm kind of do a mixture of all of them. I also like to add a little bit of simple syrup, because I think that Quantro comes on a little too strong, so just a quarter ounce of simple syrup, and about three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lime juice. This is another one of those drinks is that if you get the mix or anything like that it's all downhill from there.<br /><br />It's got to be fresh ingredients if it's going to taste good, and you want your drinks to taste good, right? I mean why else are you making them? And the key ingredient, of course, is the cranberry juice to give it that nice trademark pink color, three-quarters of an ounce of cranberry juice. Notice this is the real cranberry juice, not the processed kind that you usually see. This is a shaken drink, since we've got some citrus in there, a little more ice. Okay, now we've got our ice in there, and I'm going to grab the frozen coupe glass in the freezer. Okay, time to shake. Oh yeah, it's definitely pink. I mean that is a Cosmopolitan right there. I'm going to garnish it with a lime wheel, a nice, thin slice of lime to top it off. Cheers, girls. That's how you make a classic Cosmopolitan.{% endraw %}
