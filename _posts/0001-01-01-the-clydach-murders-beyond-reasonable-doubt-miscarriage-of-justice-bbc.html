{% raw %}At last the jitter-free version of this documentary for which you have all been praying ;-)<br />Here is the previous version  - lots of interesting comments  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Oo_gH4EEYIM">https://youtu.be/Oo_gH4EEYIM</a><br />And the previous BBC documentary from around 2000 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r30APIoE3XQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r30APIoE3XQ</a><br /><br />Campaigners rally for man convicted of killing four members of the same family<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/free-dai-morris-clydach-murders-17345351">https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/free-dai-morris-clydach-murders-17345351</a><br />Helen Hignett<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/helen.hignett">https://www.facebook.com/helen.hignett</a><br />Clydach killer David Morris is serving a whole life sentence but supporters believe he is innocent<br />Campaigners rallied in Swansea city centre calling for a man convicted of multiple murders to be freed.<br />David Morris was sentenced to four life sentences in 2002 following the horrific murders of Mandy Power, 34, her daughters Katie, 10, and Emily, eight, and her mother Doris Dawson, 80, who were all beaten to death in Clydach in June, 1999.<br />Morris' conviction was later quashed in 2005 and retrial was ordered after judges ruled that a conflict of interest involving a member of his legal team meant he had not received a fair trial.<br />However, in 2006, he was again convicted on four counts of murder.<br />Although failing in his attempts to get the verdicts overturned, Morris has always protested his innocence.<br />On Sunday morning, scores backing the campaign staged a protest in Swansea City Centre. Gathered in Castle Square carrying green and yellow balloons and ribbons, they handed out leaflets and chanted &quot;Free Dai Morris&quot;.<br /><br />The notorious Clydach murders<br />The Clydach murders were the most brutal multiple killings in Welsh history.<br />The brutal murder of three generations of a Swansea Valley family shocked the nation back in 1999 and led to one of the biggest murder investigations South Wales Police has ever seen.<br />Mandy Power, aged 34, her daughters Katie, 10, and Emily, eight, (all pictured) and their grandmother Doris Dawson, 80, were killed at their Kelvin Road home in Clydach.<br />First the killer entered his victims’ home, went upstairs and smashed a heavy fibreglass pole repeatedly into the face of 80-year-old invalid grandmother Doris Dawson.<br />When Mandy and her daughters arrived home, he killed them in identical, sadistic fashion.<br />The killer set fire to incinerate all trace of his actions.<br />Three years after the crimes, builder David Morris, now 55, was handed four life sentences for killing Mandy, 34, and her family.<br />The group's ultimate aim is to raise political awareness in the hope of forcing the case back open.<br />Geraint Evans, who helps to run the group, said at Sunday's rally: &quot;There's massive support for him, not only in Swansea but across the UK.<br />&quot;We are here to raise awareness in Swansea for the people who are not on social media.<br />&quot;The members just keep growing and at the moment we are getting between 200 and 300 a day.&quot;<br />Donna Hayes, from Penlan, was at the rally to &quot;raise awareness&quot; of the campaign.<br />&quot;I believe that Dai is innocent,&quot; the 49-year-old said.<br />&quot;I don't know the family but I feel strongly that he should not be where he is.<br />&quot;I'm here to raise more awareness and to hopefully see if anyone can come through with more evidence that can help to get him released.&quot;<br /><br />A lesbian affair<br />In the days and weeks after the Clydach murders, the public became gripped with the revelations about Mandy Power's lesbian relationship with a married police officer.<br />It emerged that Mandy's lover was a former women police sergeant married to a male officer who was the identical twin brother of a local police inspector who was the first officer on the scene.<br />All three police officers were arrested and repeatedly interviewed however none were charged.<br />It was only three years later that David Morris (pictured) faced court and was jailed for life.<br />Also at the event in Swansea was Michael O’Brien, who spent more than 11 years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit.<br />In recent weeks a social media group calling for Morris's release has gone from hundreds of members to almost 13,000.<br />David Jones, 65, from Penlan, said that the increase in the number of members and the turn-out on Sunday morning &quot;shows how strong the feeling is&quot; for Morris.<br />Darren Protheroe had travelled from Carmarthen to attend the rally as he has been supporting the campaign since it began.<br />The 41-year-old, originally from Gendros in Swansea, said that he is &quot;hoping to see Dai Morris's case reviewed by the Criminal Cases Review Commision (CCRC).&quot;<br />The group of campaigners met in Castle Square before heading to Maggie Dicks in Brynhyfryd where their previous public meeting was held.<br />Present at that meeting was former solicitor John Morris, who wrote the controversial 2017 book, The Clydach Murders: A Miscarriage of Justice.<br />&quot;Whether you like Dai Morris or not doesn’t really matter,&quot; he had told the meeting. &quot;Looking at the case from a totally objective point of view I can only come to the conclusion that he must be innocent.{% endraw %}
