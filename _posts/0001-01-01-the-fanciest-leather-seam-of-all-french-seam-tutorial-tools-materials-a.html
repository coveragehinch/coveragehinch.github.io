In this video we show you how to make a french seam by hand for your leather projects, because it's not that hard to do! This seam is a great way to stretch your smaller leather pieces by making one large pice out of a few smaller pieces. It's ideal for gussets and liners, but of course you cold expand this to featuring the seam on the outside of a leather bag or project as well!{% endraw %}
