{% raw %}Found this moment of the doctor amusing. During my time in school I was told to highlight important sentences by teachers when we did books reviews. Peterson flat out objects to that notion.<br />It never really did help to highlight, made me confused instead.<br /><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GSUG_B-new">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GSUG_B-new</a><br /><br />Support Jordan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson">https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson</a>{% endraw %}
