{% raw %}We challenged chefs of three different skill levels - amateur Stephen, home cook Daniel, and professional chef Saul Montiel from Cantina Rooftop - to make a rich cup of hot chocolate. Once each level of chef had presented their magnificent mugs, we asked expert food scientist Rose to explain the choices each cocoa-maker made along the way - both good and bad. Which cup of hot chocolate are you dipping a sugar cookie into?<br /><br /><br /><br />Chef Saul is on Instagram at @chefsaulmontiel<br /><br />Find Daniel at @iamdanielvictor<br /><br />Follow Stephen on social at @typethisexactly <br /><br />Looking for Rose?
