{% raw %}Ever wonder what it would be like to take apart a riveted aluminum fishing boat? Wonder no more! We've completely disassembled the boat down into it's individual panels so we can prep them for repairs and eventual reassembly. <br /><br />Prepping the panels involves removing rivets, or rather pieces of them left behind in the disassembly process, taking off anything on the surface of the panels like decals, the paint, glue and any other surface contaminants. Removing and chemically treating any corrosion and pitting with cleaning acid is a very important part of what we're doing as well.<br /><br />For more on removing the rivets, check out this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duGFYOK4Ruo&amp;t=245s&amp;ab_channel=FishingOntario">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duGFYOK4Ruo&amp;t=245s&amp;ab_channel=FishingOntario</a><br /><br />Cleaning acid for aluminum panels: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/38NHncd">https://amzn.to/38NHncd</a><br /><br />Acid resistant gloves: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3mZxDR3">https://amzn.to/3mZxDR3</a><br /><br />Thanks for checking out the video!
