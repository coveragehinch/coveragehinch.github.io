{% raw %}GOOD DAY MY LOVELIES. It's Libra Season and my Uncle Eric turned 60.  Watch as we celebrate his birthday.  It's still covid so many of our family members and friends were not in attendance. Also watch as Queen Crazy, Latoya comes home for the weekend to attend her besties wedding, but yet again, her suitcase did not. Of course there is always a drama attached to her and I tell her that she has a &quot;horseshoe&quot;....that means that she's lucky that the outcome is always on her side.  Hope you enjoy the good vibes in this vlog.<br /><br />Business Inquiries Email: Jilliandanford@gmail.com)<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/askauntiejillian">http://youtube.com/askauntiejillian</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/askauntiejillian">http://instagram.com/askauntiejillian</a><br />Twitter: @auntiejillian<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009063391397">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009063391397</a><br />Email your questions to: askauntiejillian@gmail.com<br /><br />INTRO MUSIC PRODUCED BY: K CUT &amp; CURTIS RICHARDSON<br />INTRO VOCALS BY: @CHARLIEVOXOFFICIAL<br />SONG INTENTIONS: VOCALS @CHARLIEVOXOFFICIAL<br /><br />Category<br />People &amp; Blogs<br />License<br />Standard YouTube License{% endraw %}
