{% raw %}Prime Time With Ravish Kumar - October 25, 2021: Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Friday that the taxes on petrol and diesel provides the &quot;ability&quot; to the government to provide welfare services such as '1 billion vaccines'. Ravish Kumar says that the burden borne by citizens due to rising fuel prices far exceeds the cost of vaccines. Do the poor have to pay indirect taxes running into thousands so that a portion of that can be availed by them as free vaccines? Economist Dr Arun Kumar says that the government is more dependent on indirect taxes which is a huge burden on the people belonging to the poorer strata of the society.
