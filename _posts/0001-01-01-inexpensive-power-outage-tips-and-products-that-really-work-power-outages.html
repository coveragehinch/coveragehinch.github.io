{% raw %}Power outages are inconvenient, but in the winter, staying warm and keeping the pipes from freezing can be a huge problem. This video is the third in a series about how to prepare for a cold weather power outage. <br /><br />In this video, we share frugal power outage solutions sent in from our viewers and then review products that we bought on the recommendation of our viewers.  It's all about finding inexpensive power outage solutions and products that really work. <br /><br />We share how we liked the Kaito solar powered wind up emergency radio and the Danforce headlamp. <br /><br />//PRODUCTS MENTIONED IN THIS VIDEO: <br /><br />- Heated Socks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3rrAJ6c">https://amzn.to/3rrAJ6c</a><br />- Rechargeable LED lantern: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3obMM5G">https://amzn.to/3obMM5G</a><br />- Jackery 1000 with solar panels: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pmMKHg">https://amzn.to/3pmMKHg</a><br />- Oupes Power Generator with solar panels: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shrsl.com/3a98i">http://shrsl.com/3a98i</a><br />- Head Lamp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pigPIe">https://amzn.to/3pigPIe</a><br />- Wind Up Flashlights: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3EfvLgD">https://amzn.to/3EfvLgD</a><br />- Voyager Wind Up Solar Radio: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3EjjjMS">https://amzn.to/3EjjjMS</a><br /><br /><br />// SUBSCRIBE: <br /><br />//TIP JAR: Want to send us a special &quot;Thank You&quot; for our content?
