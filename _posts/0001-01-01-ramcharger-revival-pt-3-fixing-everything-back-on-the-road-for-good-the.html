{% raw %}The Ramcharger project is finally complete! Going into this video we had many things that needed fixed on the ol' Ramcharger. From worn suspension parts to holes in the floor and everything in-between, we managed to get her fixed up into near mint condition! This project was a lot of work, a lot of fun, and a lot of learning! I am glad to have the Ramcharger back and I hope you guys have enjoyed watching me work on her!<br /><br />Welcome to Traplines and Inlines, this channel focuses on my dog and I on our remote Off the Grid Homestead in Northern Canada. I make videos on off grid homesteading and building, trapping, chickens, mechanical projects, and hunting and fishing.<br /><br />I went offgrid and started building my cabin over two years ago, while I was still in highschool. Since then I have built many things at the homestead and have had the priviledge of learning many things along the way. <br /><br />The homestead is designed to be relatively low maintenance and with extremely minimal expenses. All of my electricity comes from solar power, heat from woodstoves, and I haul all my water so I dont have any monthly costs associated with my homestead. <br /><br />I love the lifestyle, especially because it gives me the absolute freedom to do whatever I please. I plan on continuing to tackle awesome projects and work at building and fixing many more things, and I cant wait to share them with you on the channel. <br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Traplines and Inlines Official Merchandise: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://traplines-and-inlines.creator-spring.com">https://traplines-and-inlines.creator-spring.com</a>{% endraw %}
