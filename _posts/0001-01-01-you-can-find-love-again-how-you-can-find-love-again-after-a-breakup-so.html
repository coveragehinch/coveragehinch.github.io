{% raw %}How you can find love again after a breakup so you can find someone even better than your ex and love life again.<br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter I discuss two different email success stories from a guy in his fifties and another in his twenties who detail how my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” helped them to recover from their breakups and find love again. The guy in his fifties had been through two divorces and was in a state of depression when he found me on the Internet. His son shares some details of how he turned his life around. The second email success story is from a young guy in his early twenties who shares how he met his current girlfriend after getting dumped by his high school sweetheart, and got serious about his purpose and finishing medical school after implementing what my books teach. Two great success stories to inspire you to take action so you can create the life and lifestyle you’ve always dreamed of.<br /><br />“Breakups and the unexpected loss of a job or business often feel like the end, because our identity is totally wrapped up in our relationship, career or business. When we no longer have what we identify with and build our lives around, it feels like we no longer recognize our lives, who we are or ourselves. This in reality is a great opportunity, because we now have a clean slate to create and execute a great grand new vision, purpose and set of goals to become and achieve. Everyone must have a purpose and a reason to get up and do what we do everyday, even if that’s simply being a mom, a dad or just finding a way to enjoy life and be grateful for it no matter how close or far away we are from achieving our dreams. In order to feel successful, we must be able to measure progress, no matter how small or incremental it may be. As long as you have breath in your lungs, hope in your heart and an emotionally compelling reason to get up and take action every day towards making your life more the way you want it to be, you can find happiness and reasons to be grateful for and to enjoy your life.” ~ Coach Corey Wayne<br /><br />Click the link below to read the article “You Can Find Love Again” on my website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://understandingrelationships.com/you-can-find-love-again/36072">https://understandingrelationships.com/you-can-find-love-again/36072</a><br /><br />If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.
