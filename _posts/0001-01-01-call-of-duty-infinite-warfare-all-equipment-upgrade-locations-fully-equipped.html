{% raw %}Call of Duty Infinite Warfare has 12 Equipment Upgrades scattered across 9 Armory Locations. Finding all unlocks the Fully Equipped Trophy / Achievement.<br /><br />The following equipment must be upgraded:<br />Tactical: ATAD (V1), Hacking Device (V1), Retractable Shield (V1), Foam Wall (V1)<br />Lethal: Frag Grenade (V2), Shock Grenade (V2), Seeker-Bot (V2), Anti-Gravity Grenade (V2)<br /><br />There's a console in certain armories. Interact with it to unlock new upgrades.<br />Nothing is missable, you can get everything via mission select after beating the game! Just make sure you reach the next checkpoint to save the progress. After that you can quit out to the main menu and move on to the next location.<br />You can check your equipment before missions when you customize your loadout. Just load up one of the Retribution missions and during loadout customization check on your equipment (for example &quot;Retribution: Aftermath&quot;). You should see that it says V1 or V2 on equipment items. That's the upgrade level! Tactical equipment has only 1 upgrade (V1). Lethal equipment has 2 upgrades (V2).<br /><br />You get 2 upgrades from locations #4, ##7, #9. Everything else gives only one upgrade. It is entirely randomized what upgrade you will get. It's different for each player, but it's always guaranteed to give you a new upgrade you haven't unlocked before.<br />Pay extra attention on location #3 cause it's from a main mission objective. This one gave me a lot of trouble. It only dropped in 2 out of 10 playthroughs. After trying for 3 hours I could not determine any requirement for it to drop. It just seems random or glitched. If you are one upgrade short it's probably #3 you are missing. Just replay the mission a dozen times and it should unlock eventually.<br /><br />Armories you have previously used will have a red lockdown screen and you cannot interact with them again.<br /><br />TIMELINE (with mission names):<br /><br />#1 - Port Armor: Civilian Terminal - 0:00<br />#2 - Port Armor: Boarding Party - 0:34<br />#3 - Port Armor: Boarding Party - 1:16<br />#4 - Taken Dagger - 1:40<br />#5 - D-Con - 2:21<br />#6 - D-Con - 3:13<br />#7 - Deep Execute - 3:50<br />#8 - Burn Water: Refinery - 4:39<br />#9 - Black Flag: Prisoner Escort - 5:16<br /><br /><br />Call of Duty Infinite Warfare Trophy Guide &amp; Roadmap:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.powerpyx.com/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-trophy-guide-roadmap/">http://www.powerpyx.com/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-trophy-guide-roadmap/</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=powerpyx">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=powerpyx</a><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Follow PowerPyx:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.powerpyx.com">http://www.powerpyx.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/PowerPyx">http://www.youtube.com/PowerPyx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/PowerPyx">http://www.facebook.com/PowerPyx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/PowerPyx">http://www.twitter.com/PowerPyx</a><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />____________________________________<br /><br />All COD Infinite Warfare Trophies &amp; Achievements:<br /><br />Platinum<br />Awarded when all other trophies have been unlocked.<br /><br />New Gun Collector<br />Scan your first weapon!<br /><br />Serious Gun Collector<br />Scan 10 weapons.<br /><br />Gun Nut<br />All weapons scanned.<br /><br />Peace to the Fallen<br />Listened to all of the death letters of the fallen.<br /><br />Make it Personal<br />Load out with a custom weapon.<br /><br />Gear Up<br />Find your first equipment upgrade.<br /><br />Fully Equipped<br />Earn all equipment upgrades.<br /><br />Fangs Out<br />Earn your first Jackal item (weapon or upgrade).<br /><br />Jackal Ace<br />Earn all Jackal weapons and upgrades.<br /><br />Ante Up<br />Get your first kill on the most-wanted board.<br /><br />Aces High<br />Clear half of the most-wanted board.<br /><br />Royal Flush<br />All SDF Aces and Captains killed.<br /><br />Danger Close<br />Kill 15 enemies with a zero G grappling hook.<br /><br />You Know Nothing<br />Kill Kotch before his speech ends.<br /><br />Captain's Log<br />Use the computer in the Captain's office.<br /><br />Reality TV<br />Watch a news cast.<br /><br />Boots on the Ground<br />Go 2 minutes without double jumping or wall running in a mission where these abilities are available.<br /><br />Peek-a-boo!<br />Kick open a door, peek open a door, and throw a grenade while peeking a door.<br /><br />Gravity Kills<br />Kill an enemy while floating in your own anti-gravity grenade.<br /><br />C12<br />Kill a C12 by doing a right rodeo, a left rodeo and by blowing off multiple limbs.<br /><br />Sticker Collector<br />In Spaceland, find all of the quest items and complete the sticker pack.<br /><br />Sooooul Key<br />In Spaceland, recover the piece of the Soul Key.<br /><br />The Bigger They Are<br />In Spaceland, defeat 5 Brutes in one game without dying.<br /><br />Hoff The Charts!<br />In Spaceland, unlock David Hasselhoff.<br /><br />Rock On!<br />In Spaceland, craft a Weapon of Rock.<br /><br />Get Packed<br />In Spaceland, Pack-A-Punch a weapon.<br /><br />Batteries Not Included<br />In Spaceland, create an Exquisite Core.<br /><br />I Love the 80's<br />In Spaceland, find the MW1 and MW2 songs.<br /><br />Insert Coin<br />In Spaceland, play every arcade game at least once.<br /><br />Brain Dead<br />In Spaceland, play 30 games and get to scene 10 or higher.<br /><br />Dominion<br />Win 5 online matches in Multiplayer.{% endraw %}
