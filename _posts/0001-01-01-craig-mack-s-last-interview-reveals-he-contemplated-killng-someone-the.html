{% raw %}The interview/documentary has not been released to the public yet, but the creators of it did drop by NY Daily News to talk about it.<br /><br />Last year, Craig Mack, who was no longer the young man behind the hit that launched Sean (Diddy) Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment in 1994, invited his friend and former producer, Alvin Toney, to come to Walterboro, South Carolina for an interview. Decades before, Alvin Toney had watched Craig Mack grapple with being denied a second chance with Bad Boy Records, believing he was eclipsed by Biggie Smalls.<br /><br />According to county records, in November of 2017 Craig Mack bought a home from  nonprofit branch of the controversial Overcomer Ministry — for $5, where he lived until his death.<br /><br />Toney recorded several hours of interviews with Mack at his home in mid-February. By that point, Craig Mack was acutely aware that he was dying, struggling to breathe and relying on a cane to walk.  Craig Mack’s last interview will be the subject of an upcoming documentary featuring Long Island rappers Biz Markie and both members of the EPMD hip-hop group, Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith.<br /><br />The Craig Mack who Alvin interviewed at his home wanted to share a life story that rivaled Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur, both of whom reached massive success and fame before being shot dead. Craig Mack's decision to leave New York in 2011 was motivated by the growing fear he could meet a similar fate to the legendary rappers.<br /><br />Craig Mack said in the February interview with Alvin,  “If I would have stayed, then I’d be dead, too.”<br /><br />In the interview, Craig Mack described the moment he contemplated killing someone.  He said, “I had a gun in my lap and I’m sitting there talking to God, saying like, ‘I don’t want to do this, but if it comes to getting ugly with somebody [that's] going to try to kill me, I’m going to have to do something first to prevent that.’”<br /><br />In that moment, Craig Mack looked to a car radio for solace during his breakdown.  He flipped through AM stations looking for the hip hop channel he loved while contemplating whether or not to use the gun. Instead, he found Ralph Gordon Stair — a self-proclaimed prophet — preaching on the airwaves.<br /><br />Craig Mack said “I knew that it was God talking to me because of the way it made me feel emotionally, I broke down crying all over the place in the car: ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry I was thinking about trying to do this to somebody.'”<br /><br />Alvin declined to reveal who Craig Mack had considered killing but suggested the conflict was set off by &quot;emotional things&quot; involving his family.<br /><br />***MY LINKS****<br />BUNDLE SALE!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lailahlynn.mayvenn.com/">https://lailahlynn.mayvenn.com/</a><br />*Take 25% Off EVERYTHING using the code SPRING<br />Quality hair extensions with a 30 day money back guarantee<br /><br />SOCIAL MEDIA<br />IG: @lailahlynntv<br />TWITTER: @lailahlynn<br />EMAIL: lailah@lailahlynn.com<br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lailahlynn.com">https://lailahlynn.com</a><br /><br />Disclaimer - Excerpts from books, blogs, social media, and public figures protected by Fair Use Clause of the Copyright Act which states - Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phono-records or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, COMMENT, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.{% endraw %}
