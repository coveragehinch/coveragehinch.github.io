{% raw %}Biden administration considering millions in payments to migrant families separated at the border. The Biden administration is reportedly considering making payments of approximately $450,000 to each person separated from their family at the southern border, the Wall Street Journal reports, showing signs of a potential settlement for several lawsuits that claim the U.S. government’s policies left them with lasting psychological effects. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services are in talks to offer each person who had been separated $450,000, the Journal reports, citing multiple sources close to the discussions. The offer comes to nearly $1 million per family, as most families who crossed the border included one parent and one child, though the Journal reports the official number could change. It is unclear how many people will be eligible for the settlement, but about 940 families have reportedly filed claims.<br /><br /><br /><br />If You Would Like To Support the Show Thank Y<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="ouhttps://cash.app/$Informationman06">ouhttps://cash.app/$Informationman06</a><br /><br /><br />Subscribe To My SECOND Channel Information Man Show As Well Thank You:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8MjODwLBmJZ3Ml2NXwvFRg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8MjODwLBmJZ3Ml2NXwvFRg</a> <br /><br />Instagram : InformationmanPodcast06  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram">https://www.instagram</a><br />MY PATREON Thank You : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user">https://www.patreon.com/user</a> <br /><br />ＬＩＫＥ | ＣＯＭＭＥＮＴ | ＳＨＡＲＥ | ＳＵＢＳＣＲＩＢＥ<br /><br />The show attempts to make assessments.
