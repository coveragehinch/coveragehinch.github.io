{% raw %}Lord Petyr Baelish tribute. <br />He is such a fascinating character! Complex, tragic, cunning and Master of Chaos (with a pinch of creep..) ..he also has some of the most amazing lines in show. Think what you may of him, but he plays the game damn well! ..which he should, since he is also the one who started it. <br />.. and yes, I find him insanely hot, for reasons I don't know! xD{% endraw %}
