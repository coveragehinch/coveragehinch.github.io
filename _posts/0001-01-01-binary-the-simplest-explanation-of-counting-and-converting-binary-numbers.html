{% raw %}In this video we look at the Binary number system. Our jumping off point is comparing and contrasting it to the Decimal number system, which is already familiar to us. This makes understanding Binary much simpler.<br /><br />We then learn how to count in binary, and how counting in Binary is actually very similar to counting in decimal. <br /><br />Then we look at the details around why Binary conversions work the way they do. Form there, we look at a simple and fast way to convert from Binary to Decimal, and to convert from Decimal to Binary. <br /><br />Finally, we take tie everything back together when we look at an IPv4 address, solidifying some key lessons we learned along the way.<br /><br />00:00 - Start<br />00:07 - Binary Introduction<br />00:42 - How to count in binary<br />07:29 - Understanding how Binary conversion works<br />10:02 - Converting Binary numbers to Decimal<br />14:45 - Converting Decimal numbers to Binary<br />20:33 - 8 bits and IPv4 Addresses<br /><br />A great follow up to this video if you are trying to learn Subnetting is the Subnetting mastery playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.practicalnetworking.net/stand-alone/subnetting-mastery/">https://www.practicalnetworking.net/stand-alone/subnetting-mastery/</a>{% endraw %}
