{% raw %}This is me reacting to, analyzing, and talking USA Volleyball passing from a 2019 match between USA and Poland. In this video I strictly watch serve receive, talking about technique and how we can be better. If you have any comments or questions please leave them below in the comment section :)<br /><br />I know this video is a little rough and choppy, and has a lot of technical terms going on. I promise to get better at this sort of video in the future!<br /><br />FOLLOW ME:<br />Instagram: @erikshoji<br />Twitter: @shojinator<br />TikTok: @thelibero<br />Cameo: cameo.com/erikshoji<br /><br />CONTACT ME:<br />erikshojivolleyball@gmail.com<br /><br />#erikshoji #libero #volleyball #passing{% endraw %}
