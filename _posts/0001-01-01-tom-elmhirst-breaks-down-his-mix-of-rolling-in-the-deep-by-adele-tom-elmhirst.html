{% raw %}Tom Elmhirst gives us a behind the scenes look at drum and vocal elements from Adele's smash hit 'Rolling in the Deep'<br />Full video available exclusively on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mwtm.com/dm32">https://mwtm.com/dm32</a><br /><br />Filmed at Electric Lady studios in NYC, this exclusive series uncovers the magic behind the sound of Adele’s 2010 superhit ‘Rolling in the Deep’. With the Pro Tools multi-track session spread across a Neve VR console, the famed mixer Tom Elmhirst takes you through his analog signal chains and routing. Following an overview of his inserts, effects sends, busses, and mix chain, he comments on Paul Epworth’s rough mix and then starts a new mix himself. Within about twenty minutes, he feels that his new mix is sonically superior to his original version! Tom demonstrates his usage of VCA faders, parallel drum treatment, console EQ, vocal effects, automation, de-essing, and other techniques acquired throughout his illustrious career.{% endraw %}
