There are also some very important rules to follow if you decide to gamble:<br /><br />1. Don't think of gambling as a way to make money.<br />Gambling should be seen as a form of entertainment and even if you can win in the short run, the house always has an edge in the long run.<br /><br />2. Only gamble with money you can afford to lose.<br /><br />3. Set a money limit in advance.<br />It's easy to get carried away when playing, which is why you should set a limit in advance. This is easily done in your profile on most casinos.<br /><br />4. NEVER chase losses.<br />Chasing losses can be devastating. Machines / casino games have no memory, so being unlucky for a certain amount of games won't make you more likely to win further on. If you hit your limits, you should always quit.<br /><br />5. Take frequent breaks.<br />Breaks are crucial to not lose your perspective when playing.<br /><br />‚ùó For casino links:<br />18+ ( you won‚Äôt be able to sign up if not) T&amp;C's Apply, New Customers Only, Gamble Responsibly, www.begambleaware.org<br /><br />If you have any other questions about responsible gambling, you can always ask in chat.<br /><br />Feel free to like and subscribe if you want to see more casino action and vlogs ‚ù§Ô∏è{% endraw %}
