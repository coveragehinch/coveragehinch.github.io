{% raw %}Disabled mannequins will be eliciting astonished looks from passers-by on Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse today. Between the perfect mannequins, there will be figures with scoliosis or brittle bone disease modelling the latest fashions. One will have shortened limbs; the other a malformed spine. The campaign has been devised for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities by Pro Infirmis, an organisation for the disabled. Entitled &quot;Because who is perfect? Get closer.&quot;, it is designed to provoke reflection on the acceptance of people with disabilities. Director Alain Gsponer has captured the campaign as a short film.<br />The figures are life-sized, three-dimensional representations of Miss Handicap 2010, Jasmin Rechsteiner, radio presenter and film critic Alex Oberholzer, track and field athlete Urs Kolly, blogger Nadja Schmid and actor Erwin Aljukic. <br />&quot;We often go chasing after ideals instead of accepting life in all its diversity. Pro Infirmis strives especially for the acceptance of disability and the inclusion of people with disabilities,&quot; says Mark Zumbühl, a member of the Pro Infirmis Executive Board, in describing the campaign. <br /><br />See our former TV-Spots under:<br /><br />Bear: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/zFWr-CKMWGY">http://youtu.be/zFWr-CKMWGY</a><br />Gianni Blumer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/Qr-xnqgpin8">http://youtu.be/Qr-xnqgpin8</a><br /><br />Music: Lost At Sea by Dave Thomas Junior{% endraw %}
