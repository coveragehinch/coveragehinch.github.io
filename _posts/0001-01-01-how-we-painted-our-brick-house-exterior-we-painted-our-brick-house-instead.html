{% raw %}We painted our brick house! Instead of paying thousands of dollars to have our house painted, we did it DIY style of course. It turned out so good! The old brick was outdated and this house needed a little TLC on the exterior. Next up is finishing the front entryway and the back patio makeover! <br /><br />Thank you Wagner for sponsoring this video!<br />Control Pro Cart Sprayer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3caesAP">https://bit.ly/3caesAP</a><br /><br />Should you paint your brick house? Will the paint chip out? Moisture behind the brick? These questions and more are all over Google, and for good reason. It is crucial that you use a brick / masonry paint or Lime product to paint your brick. Not properly prepping your brick or using the wrong product can lead to moisture issues. We chose to use a Behr Masonry paint for this reason. Behr also makes an elastomeric product, meaning it's flexible, but from my research performs marginally better on brick and costs quite a bit more. Lime paint from companies like Romabio are fantastic options but cost 60% more and we were unable to find any tintable products locally. Behr's paint was $105/5 gallons and Romabio was $215-$240 for 4 Gallons. We used a total of 40 gallons to paint the exterior of our 2300 sqft home with two coats. <br /><br />WHAT WE USED (affiliate links):<br />Ryobi Power Washer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/P0zAB6">https://homedepot.sjv.io/P0zAB6</a><br />3M Pretaped Plastic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3uYGdU4">https://amzn.to/3uYGdU4</a><br />Brick Paint (We got it in the color Alabaster): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/doymny">https://homedepot.sjv.io/doymny</a><br />Door Paint (in the color Broadway): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/LPakEM">https://homedepot.sjv.io/LPakEM</a><br />Front Entry Lights: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/ZdVZB0">https://homedepot.sjv.io/ZdVZB0</a><br /><br />OTHER SWEET DEALS<br />10% off Ariat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3egV99O">https://bit.ly/3egV99O</a><br /><br />ðŸ”¥Check Out The Brand New Woodbrew Guides!<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://woodbrew.retrieve.com/store/#/">https://woodbrew.retrieve.com/store/#/</a><br /><br />SOCIALS:<br />Instagram: www.instagram.com/woodbrew_/<br />Pinterest: www.pinterest.com/Woodbrew/{% endraw %}
