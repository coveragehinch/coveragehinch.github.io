The skills and tools have immediately made an impact on our organization.” <br />-- John Berrios, Vice President Commercial Operations, Bayer “<br /><br />I learned more useful and practical strategy tools in one day with you than in five days at the Wharton Executive Education Program on Strategy. Your Strategic Thinking program was much more of what I was looking for: one day of using practical tools to help develop a strategy. I can envision using what you taught us immediately with my team for next year’s planning.” <br />-- Michael Tomcsanyi, National Director, Sunovion <br /><br />&quot;Your Deep Dive Strategic Thinking workshop was very effective at introducing planning concepts I am now using to develop strategies at FedEx. Your strategic concepts are universal for most product and service applications, and by providing about 10 concepts, we were sure to walk away with at least half of the concepts that we can apply to our specific work. I found your Deep Dive Strategic Thinking Process to be skillfully facilitated and concepts to be vital planning tools.&quot; <br />– Ann Smith-Gill, Marketing Special Advisor, FedEx{% endraw %}
