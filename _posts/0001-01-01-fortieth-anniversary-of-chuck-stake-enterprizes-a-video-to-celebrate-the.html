{% raw %}A video to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of Chuck Stake Enterprizes. <br /><br />On Thursday, March 23, 1972 Chuck Stake Enterprizes was founded in Toronto, Ontario on Queen Street East. CSE is a Correspondence/MailArt company. Here is a pen and ink and gel pen drawing that is 8.5 x 11 inches as well as three sets of Artist Trading Cards that I made as well. Mostly pen and ink and gel pens but also mechanical pencil and coloured pencil. The date of the founding of CSE is the main focus of these works. Also included some drawings from previous anniversaries and some related images. <br /><br />Four postal workers use music to make the work of canceling stamps less boring. They were recorded at the University of Ghana post office in 1975 by James Koetting. I dont believe the music is available on iTunes or anywhere else except YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/vf0I5s-Ghhk">http://youtu.be/vf0I5s-Ghhk</a><br /><br />Correspondence/MailArt Information:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_art">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_art</a>{% endraw %}
