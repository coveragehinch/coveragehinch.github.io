{% raw %}Across the street from neighbourhood green space, welcome to 856 Finley Avenue, a beautifully updated 3+2 bedroom raised bungalow situated on a corner lot within South West Ajax’s lakeside community of Discovery Bay.<br /><br />Evergreen trees, hedges, and shrubs bring year-round curb appeal to this brick home - which features a single car garage in addition to ample driveway parking, with an interlocking walkway from the driveway to the front entrance; and is minutes from prime amenities, as well as Ajax’s waterfront park. <br /><br />Opening into a tiled foyer, a carpeted split staircase leads to both the main and lower levels, its railing painted in the modern colour contrast of grey and white.<br /><br />Elegantly updated and having an easy flow that is ideal for entertaining, the main level showcases wide plank New England hardwood flooring throughout, as well as pot lighting and crown moldings in the principal rooms - with the crown moldings also featured in the hallway leading to the bedrooms.<br /><br />Separated by the railing surrounding the open space around the stairs - the living and dining rooms have their own distinct entertaining areas, yet enjoy an openness to each, while their large windows allow for abundant natural light and enhance their bright, airy aura. <br /><br />The newly renovated kitchen is as functional as it is beautiful - and showcases gorgeous upgrades including the quartz counters, its tiled back splashes, and a double wide stainless steel under mount sink. The white cabinetry has upgraded hardware and a convenient servery area - while a stainless steel fridge with bottom mount freezer, as well as an oven with smooth surface cooktop, complete the kitchen. The adjacent breakfast room is brightened with track lighting, and this space also has an alternate potential as a combined prep, storage, and breakfast area with the addition of a wall pantry and either a permanent or portable island with seating.<br /><br />Also newly renovated, the 4-pc washroom showcases beautiful upgrades - including oversized floor tiles, and the oversized wall tiles in a bath area featuring a soaker tub and rainfall shower head; as well as the stone counter and lighting with its vanity.<br /><br />The second and third bedrooms both have double closets - with the second bedroom filled with soft diffused northern light through its window, while the third bedroom - which could also be used as a home office, sitting area, or media room - has a sliding door walk-out onto a raised deck in the backyard. Mature evergreens and hedges give the yard privacy, and behind the yard - just steps from the front door - is a walking path to nearby Lakeside Park, and which connects with others throughout the neighbourhood.  <br /><br />The master bedroom is quite spacious, is bathed in soft diffused northern light, and features a large double closet - and completing this level is a linen closet across the hall, as well as a mirrored door coat closet just off the staircase landing.<br /><br />The fully finished lower level brings exceptional living and recreational space to the home - and with the split staircase at the foyer entrance, is also well-suited as an in-law suite.<br /><br />Featuring 10’ ceilings, oversized above grade windows throughout, and new broadloom where laid - to the left of the staircase landing is a naturally bright family room with a ceiling fan, which also provides access to a nicely sized storage area under the staircase.<br /><br />The remainder of this level features an eat-in kitchen brightened with track lighting, and which includes a fridge and stove - and off this space is a combined furnace and laundry room with washer and dryer; a 4-pc washroom with a linen and storage closet outside its door; as well as two incredibly spacious bedrooms, both having oversized wall-to-wall double closets.<br /><br />A short walk to a convenience store and Lakeside Public School, as well as within the catchment area of Southwood Park Public, St. James Catholic Elementary, Ajax High, and Notre Dame Catholic Secondary Schools for their French Immersion programs - this home is also a short walk to the restaurants and boutique shops within historic Pickering Village, and enjoys proximity to many of Ajax’s exceptional amenities - such as indoor and outdoor sports and fitness facilities, recreational and community centres, the Durham Centre Shopping Mall, Lakeridge Health Ajax Pickering Hospital, the GO Station, as well as quick access to Hwy 401 - and Ajax’s beautiful Waterfront Park with its over seven kilometres of trails along Lake Ontario is also a short walk or bike ride away.<br /><br />For more information, contact The Shiv Bansal Team, of Century 21 Percy Fulton Ltd., Brokerage, at (905) 683-2100, or direct at (416) 396-3550.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bansalteam.com/">http://bansalteam.com/</a>{% endraw %}
