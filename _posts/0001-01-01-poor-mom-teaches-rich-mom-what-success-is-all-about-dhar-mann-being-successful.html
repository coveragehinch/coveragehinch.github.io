{% raw %}Being successful won't always make you happy, but being happy will always make you successful. Watch this inspirational video where a poor mom and her son show a rich mom why success doesn't equal happiness. üëâüèΩ Hey #DharMannFam, thanks for watching my video!

They treat life as if it's some sort of score card and whoever gets the highest score wins. Since they went to a better school that somehow makes them smarter, since they have more money that somehow makes them better or since they have a fancy house that somehow makes them happier. But, what's important to remember is having a great life is not based on what you have, it's based on what you give. That person who didn't go to the best school may have learned more from life experience. That person who doesn't make a lot of money may be helping a lot more people. And that person who doesn't have a fancy house may still have a happier home. <br /><br />Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here ‚ûû ‚ûû <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DharMannYouTube">http://bit.ly/DharMannYouTube</a> **Make sure you click the bell icon so you can get notifications when my next video goes up so you don‚Äôt miss anything! <br /><br />FOLLOW ME: life tips, financial tips, relationship tips, plus much more!
