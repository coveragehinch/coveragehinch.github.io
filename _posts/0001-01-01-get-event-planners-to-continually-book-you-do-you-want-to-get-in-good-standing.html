{% raw %}Do you want to get in good standing with event planners? Do you want them to continually book you? Do you want to be seen as an automatic hire?<br /><br />You need to constantly be evolving in your ability to deliver professionally. Event planners want to see a speaker who's continually committed to getting better over time, regardless of how<br />professional they already may be. They want to see you striving for excellence.<br /><br />Continually improve the delivery of your speech. Practice and rehearse. For virtual events, continue to invest in better gear as time goes on. You can get better microphones, cameras, or lighting. All of this contributes to the the perceived professionalism of the service you are delivering.<br /><br />Even if you are already a seasoned presenter, there is always room for improvement. This is especially true in the wake of virtual events. If you want to keep getting booked, show people that you are continually getting better. They'll have confidence that the next time will be even better than the first.{% endraw %}
