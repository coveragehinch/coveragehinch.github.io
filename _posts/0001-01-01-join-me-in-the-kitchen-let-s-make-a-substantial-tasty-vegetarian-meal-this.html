{% raw %}This is not a recipe - it's just an invitation to join me in the kitchen, where we will prepare a satisfying and nutritious vegetarian meal, using ingredients mostly from a recent mini foodhaul video (here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1PL9idE144),">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1PL9idE144),</a> plus some of my foraged and homemade ingredients.{% endraw %}
