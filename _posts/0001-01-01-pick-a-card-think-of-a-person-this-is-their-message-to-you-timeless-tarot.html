{% raw %}Think of a person you'd like to receive a message from, it could be your love interest, a friend, a relative, somebody who passed away, an ancestor, whoever you want to be in contact to. Bear in mind that it could also be their higher self talking to you and not necessarily their conscious self. <br /><br />Remember it's a timeless reading so no matter what day you're going to click onto this video, it will apply to your current situation. There are 3 piles to choose from, so here are the timestamps: <br /><br />ðŸŒ¿ TIMESTAMPS ðŸŒ¿<br /><br />- Intro: 00:00<br />- Pile 1: Rabbit + Hawthorn Berries: 01:54<br />- Pile 2: Elephant + Apricot Seed: 17:50<br />- Pile 3: Gazelle + Pine cone: 37:02<br />  <br />I believe that your spirits, angels, ancestors and even your higher self will be able to guide you towards the right choice, so trust your first intuition while picking the pile (or even piles) for you. <br />Remember though that being only a GENERAL reading it may or may not fully resonate with everyone, take only what feels right for you and let go of the rest:) Always trust your INTUITION. <br /><br />ðŸŒ± SUBSCRIBE ðŸŒ± if you want to get more free tarot readings about LOVE, RELATIONSHIPS, PERSONAL GROWTH, ABUNDANCE, MESSAGES FROM SPIRITS, MONTHLY PREDICTIONS, plus free REIKI SESSIONS and more. <br />Don't forget to hit the notification bell down below if you want to be notified every time I upload a new video, which happens every THURSDAY AND SUNDAY.
