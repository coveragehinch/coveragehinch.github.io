{% raw %}Gratitude is central to the service that we give and receive. By expression or action, gratitude is also essential to our faith.<br /><br />This speech was given on November 16, 1999. <br /><br />Read the speech here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/rulon-d-pope/free-riding-gratitude/">https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/rulon-d-pope/free-riding-gratitude/</a><br /><br />Learn more about the author:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/rulon-d-pope/">https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/rulon-d-pope/</a><br /><br />More BYU Speeches here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.speeches.byu.edu/">https://www.speeches.byu.edu/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to BYU Speeches:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/c/byuspeeches/">http://www.youtube.com/c/byuspeeches/</a><br /><br />Follow BYU Speeches:<br /><br />Podcasts:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.speeches.byu.edu/podcasts/">https://www.speeches.byu.edu/podcasts/</a><br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/byuspeeches/">https://www.facebook.com/byuspeeches/</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/byuspeeches/">https://www.instagram.com/byuspeeches/</a> <br />Twitter:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/byuspeeches/">https://www.twitter.com/byuspeeches/</a> <br />Pinterest:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/byuspeeches/">https://www.pinterest.com/byuspeeches/</a> <br /><br />© Brigham Young University.

However, I am at a distinct disadvantage: I am an economist. In spite of these trepidations, I will on occasion resort to personal experiences and observations, a few of which are colored by my chosen academic field. However, you shouldn’t expect much. An old joke goes like this: “There are three kinds of economists: those who can count and those who can’t.” I feel that way sometimes, but today I am actually going to talk in a general way about counting.<br /><br />It seems that many of the most important experiences in life are very subtle and inward. The Apostle Paul said: “We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal” (2 Corinthians 4:18). Love, for all of its power and importance in our lives, is most difficult to describe. Perhaps I am not the only husband who gets a glimpse of God’s grace when I look into the eyes of my dear wife and exclaim, “How could this wonderful thing have happened to such as I?” Love does not lend itself well to direct observation, but it is revealed and nourished in many subtle ways. For those of us who have embraced the great plan of happiness, we know that the love of God and of man is the ultimate distillation of that great plan. It is of one of these very subtle manifestations of and strengthenings of love that I wish to talk about today: gratitude, both as a spiritual feeling and as an ensuing expression.<br /><br />Some months ago I was driving somewhere with my son Cameron. Cameron is 11 years old, and he likes to talk. In spite of wonderful Mormon ads on parental listening, unfortunately I am often more aware that Cameron is talking than I actually understand what he is saying. As I tried to refocus on what he was saying, he mentioned a name. I asked, “Who is that?” He replied with considerable emphasis and surprise, “He is my Primary teacher.” I felt that I was thankful for this man’s help in teaching my son, yet I hadn’t revealed it by my behavior. How easy it would have been to have previously asked my son about his Primary class and learned his teacher’s name. I clearly failed the implicit quiz given to me by my son.<br /><br />It is not always immediately apparent to us or to others what is in our hearts. There can be insensitivities even when our hearts are in the right place, not to mention those that are truly born of ingratitude. Neither are particularly pretty. As I reflected on which of these was correct regarding Cameron’s teacher, my mind was drawn to an experience that looms large in my early married life. When I was in graduate school, my wife, Sue, was in a fairly serious car accident. A young man stole his aunt’s car and drove it through a red light, hitting my wife and our two small daughters in our Volkswagen bug. My wife can verify that I was a little too anxious, after hearing that they were all well, to move on to inquire about the condition of the car, which was only a few years old. As it turned out, it was totaled.<br /><br />Those who know me well are probably amused or even a little concerned at hearing this story, because I have always been a bit too captivated by machinery. Perhaps this is a legacy of my rural heritage. However, this experience gave me a vivid insight: one can build relationships by expressing love and gratitude or one can diminish them by silence or by expressing ingratitude...&quot;{% endraw %}
