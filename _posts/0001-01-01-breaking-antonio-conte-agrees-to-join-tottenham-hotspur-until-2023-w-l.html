{% raw %}Joe and Zac discuss the news that Nuno Espirito Santo has been sacked after his Spurs side lost 3-0 at home to Manchester United, whilst also talking about how his most likely replacement, Antonio Conte, will do in North London. Will he be able to get the best out of the squad? Will Harry Kane find his best form? Was it too soon to get rid of Nuno? The boys discuss all, along with discussions over West Ham, Manchester City and Aston Villa!<br /><br />► SPONSOR THIS VIDEO: footballdailyuk@gmail.com<br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to FOOTBALL DAILY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/fdsubscribe">http://bit.ly/fdsubscribe</a><br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to EURO FOOTBALL DAILY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/37igEnb">https://bit.ly/37igEnb</a><br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to FOOTBALL DAILY PODCASTS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3moyeMO">https://bit.ly/3moyeMO</a><br /><br />► JOIN THE FAN RUN FD FAMILY DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/KH5YMxA">https://discord.gg/KH5YMxA</a><br /><br />► SIGN UP FOR A FREE SMARTERSCOUT MEMBERSHIP HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smarterscout.com/">https://smarterscout.com/</a><br /><br />This is Football Daily - the home of Premier League fan analysis on YouTube.
