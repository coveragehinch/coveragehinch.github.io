{% raw %}An inconspicuous tollbooth on a lonely stretch of road: the tollbooth operator is barely noticed by the people who drive through, pay their money and drive on in an endless stream.<br />But he notices them.<br />These brief interactions allow him to imagine the nature of their lives; their sorrows, their joys, and the love stories they are driving towards. The narratives that follow could be his imagination, or they could be the truth, but each one explores a different facet of love, life and heartbreak.<br />We all know the pleasure of people watching when we're in cafes or public transport. LITTLE DEATHS is a film dedicated to the pleasure of eavesdropping on strangers, and imagining what kind of life they lead.<br />When he sees the girl who works in the tollbooth next to his, the stories he imagines come to reflect what he cannot do in real life and eventually pushes him to start a love story of his own.{% endraw %}
