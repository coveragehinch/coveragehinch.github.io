That's parents for you<br />Very loyal?<br />Shoulda had my back, but you put a knife in it, my hands are full<br />What else should I carry for you?<br />I cared for you, but<br />Feels like we're on the edge right now<br />I wish that I could say I'm proud<br />I'm sorry that I let you down<br />L-l-let you down<br />All these voices in my head get loud<br />I wish that I could shut them out<br />I'm sorry that I let you down<br />L-l-let you down<br />Yeah, you don't wanna make this work<br />You just wanna make this worse<br />Want me to listen to you<br />But you don't ever hear my words<br />You don't wanna know my hurt, yet<br />Let me guess you want an apology, probably<br />How can we keep going at a rate like this?<br />We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave<br />Please don't come after me<br />I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all<br />Go ahead, just drink it off<br />Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong<br />Ain't that what you always do?<br />I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood<br />What else can I offer you?<br />There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you<br />Feels like we're on the edge right now<br />I wish that I could say I'm proud<br />I'm sorry that I let you down<br />L-l-let you down<br />All these voices in my head get loud<br />I wish that I could shut them out<br />I'm sorry that I let you down<br />L-l-let you down<br />Yeah, don't talk down to me<br />That's not gonna work now<br />Packed all my clothes and I moved out<br />I don't even wanna go to your house<br />Everytime I sit on that couch<br />I feel like you lecture me<br />Eventually, I bet that we<br />Could have made this work and probably woulda figured things out<br />But I guess that I'm a letdown<br />But it's cool, I checked out<br />Oh, you wanna be friends now?<br />Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now<br />Sit around and talk about the good times<br />That didn't even happen<br />I mean, why are you laughing?<br />Must have missed that joke<br />Let me see if I can find a reaction<br />No, but at least you're happy<br />Feels like we're on the edge right now<br />I wish that I could say I'm proud<br />I'm sorry that I let you down<br />Oh, I let you down<br />All these voices in my head get loud<br />And I wish that I could shut them out<br />I'm sorry that I let you down<br />Oh, let you down<br />I'm sorry<br />I'm so sorry now<br />I'm sorry<br />That I let you down<br /><br />Nf- let you down lyrics <br />I do not own this song{% endraw %}
