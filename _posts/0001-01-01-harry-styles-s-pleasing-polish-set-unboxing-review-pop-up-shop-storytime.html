{% raw %}If you don't know, Harry Styles is starting a skincare/cosmetic brand called Pleasing, and they had their first pop up shop in LA. With 20 minutes notice, I ran to get ready to get over to Studio City. At the truck they were only selling the Perfect Polish Set, so that's what I wound up getting. I'm a big nail polish fan, so I was curious to try these out. It's definitely the most high end nail polish I've ever used in my life. <br />But is it worth that price tag? Since it's still before the general sale, I figured I would show you what these colors look like IRL best I can and give a review of the polish itself with this unboxing and review. Hopefully this can help you decide whether it will be worth it to you. Also, I'm throwing in a little storytime about the Pleasing pop up itself and meeting Harry Lambert there. <br />If you have any questions about the nail polish, feel free to ask in the comments! <br />-Lanie <br />If you want to learn more about Pleasing:<br />My article on it: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.musicmusingsandme.com/2021/11/harry-styles-steps-into-beauty-business.html">https://www.musicmusingsandme.com/2021/11/harry-styles-steps-into-beauty-business.html</a><br />Pleasing Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pleasing.com/products/nail-polish-4-set">https://pleasing.com/products/nail-polish-4-set</a><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />S O C I A L S<br />@mslaniebrice on Twitter (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mslaniebrice)">https://twitter.com/mslaniebrice)</a> and Instagram (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mslaniebrice/)">https://www.instagram.com/mslaniebrice/)</a> and TikTok<br />@movieinmyhead for art<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.laniebrice.com">https://www.laniebrice.com</a><br /><br />M U S I C<br />Original Songs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS5LOlBIIBQ_f1XDBxFwxwCiIjrTHevaw">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS5LOlBIIBQ_f1XDBxFwxwCiIjrTHevaw</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-498913248">https://soundcloud.com/user-498913248</a><br />Music Blog:<br />Music, Musings, and Me<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.musicmusingsandme.com">https://www.musicmusingsandme.com</a><br />Subscribe to Weekly Music Newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://musicmusingsandme.substack.com/welcome">https://musicmusingsandme.substack.com/welcome</a><br /><br />B O O K   B L O G<br />Reading, Writing, and Me:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.readingwritingandme.com">http://www.readingwritingandme.com</a><br />Twitter: @readwriteandme<br />Instagram: @readingwritingandme<br /><br />C O N T A C T<br />For Business Inquiries:<br />lbricecontact@gmail.com <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Music Credits:<br />Music by Mark Generous - Heavy Eyes - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=AF931758">https://thmatc.co/?l=AF931758</a>{% endraw %}
