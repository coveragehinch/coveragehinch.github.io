{% raw %}In San Diego a serial killer who strangled 35-40 prostitutes, put them in garbage bags wrapped with tape, and disposed of them in dumpsters was not found until a Canadian lab was able to get prints from a plastic bag 6 years later. A Hollywood cold case file was solved by computerized fingerprint ID (AFIS), convicting a killer over 30 years later. A man in Vermont was skewered to the floor by a ski pole; the murderer had left bloody fingerprints on a door frame and a palm print on the pole, but raising them took an expert. The suspect was convicted--delivered into the arms of justice by his own hands.<br /><br />Content licensed from New Dominion Pictures to Little Dot Studios.<br /><br />Any queries, please contact us at: owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com{% endraw %}
