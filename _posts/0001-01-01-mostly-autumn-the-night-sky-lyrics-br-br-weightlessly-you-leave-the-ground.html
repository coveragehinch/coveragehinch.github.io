{% raw %}Lyrics:<br /><br />Weightlessly you leave the ground<br />Hanging gently in the breeze,<br />You lift your head to face the stars<br />and catch the wind above the trees,<br />You know you're safe, you know you're there<br />The night sky rushing through your hair<br />The shadow cast across the fields<br />By silver moon that lights the night<br />Over the mountains over the hills,<br />The changing horizons, you drift through the valleys<br />Reaching for distance, floating alone,<br />Like an eagle at midnight, under the stars.<br /><br />Through frozen eyes you see the hills<br />Go rolling by, your spirit fills with wonder<br />And the freedom to roam the winter sky,<br />You drift into the fragrance of the forest<br />Swaying gently down below.<br /><br />The warm glow of a village sleeping silently,<br />You rise to meet the bleakness of the mountain<br />That roll into the distance,<br />A ghost upon the north wind bound for nowhere,<br />To meet the rising sun.{% endraw %}
