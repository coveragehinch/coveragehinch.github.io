{% raw %}&quot;How to Get Well, Stay Well, and Never Be Sick Again” was presented by Raymond Francis DSc.,MSc, RNC on November 16, 2017 at the  Silicon Valley Health Institute.<br /><br />Raymond Francis, D.Sc., M.Sc., RNC has been called a “brilliant advanced thinker” and has been cited as “one of the few scientists who has achieved a breakthrough understanding of health and disease.”<br /><br />On the cutting-edge of health science, Raymond is an internationally recognized leader in the field of optimal-health maintenance and a pioneer in transforming our failed disease-care system to a true health-care system. He is a chemist by training, a graduate of M.I.T., a bestselling author, and a world-class speaker.<br /><br />At the height of his career as president of a management consulting firm, Raymond’s health began declining. What began as fatigue and allergic reactions, ended up as several autoimmune syndromes, chemical sensitivities, chronic fatigue, and acute liver failure.  At age 48, his imminent death was considered a medical certainty. With only days to live, he used his knowledge of biochemistry to save his life and restore his health. Now age 80, Raymond enjoys an extraordinary level of health and vitality.<br /><br />Since his recovery, he has devoted himself to helping others to get well and stay well. To teach others how to achieve the level of health he has achieved, Raymond devised a new health model, The Beyond Health Model. This model cuts through the complexity and confusion, takes the mystery out of disease, and makes health simple for the average person. This model is so simple it can be taught to a child, yet so powerful that many have used it to cure themselves of incurable illnesses.<br /><br />Raymond is a former U.S. Army officer who served in a combat infantry division. He is listed in standard references including: Who’s Who in the World, Who’s Who in America, Who’s Who in Medicine and Healthcare, Who’s Who in Science and Engineering and Who’s Who in Finance and Industry. He has written five breakthrough books, the international bestseller Never Be Sick Again, Never Be Fat Again, Never Fear Cancer Again, Never Feel Old Again, and The Great American Health Hoax.<br /><br />Visit Raymond Francis' official website at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://raymondfrancisauthor.com/">http://raymondfrancisauthor.com/</a><br /><br />Newsletter on this presentation at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.svhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NOVEMBER_Newsletter_2017_1c.pdf">http://www.svhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NOVEMBER_Newsletter_2017_1c.pdf</a><br /><br /><br />Visit the Silicon Valley Health Institute (aka Smart Life Forum) at<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.svhi.com">http://www.svhi.com</a><br /><br />Silicon Valley Health Institute Smart Life Forum Palo Alto{% endraw %}
