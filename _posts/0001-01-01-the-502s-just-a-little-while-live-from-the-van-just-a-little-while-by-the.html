{% raw %}Just A Little While by The 502s :)<br /><br />Lyrics: <br />Late nights in a wild town<br />We go out, roaming around<br />Holding your hair in my hand<br />Friday nights felt like they’d never end<br />You were Miss Hollywood<br />I was your chic chauffeur<br />Take you where you want to go<br />Get you there, nice and slow<br />You look up at me from your back seat<br />With that same old grin<br /><br />And I said<br />Wait just a little while<br />And tell me where you’ve been<br />I’ve been staying up at night<br />Thinking about it<br />And it’s been oh so long<br />That I’ve been feeling like this<br />And I know that I’ve never been more sure<br /><br />We went to the cinema<br />And you wore your shades inside<br />I couldn’t stop laughing, when you put on mine<br />And knocked that drink from my hand onto the floor<br />And then ran to Theater 8, and you hid behind the door<br />You look up at me from your back seat<br />With that same old grin<br /><br />And I said<br />Wait just a little while<br />And tell me where you’ve been<br />I’ve been staying up at night<br />Thinking about it<br />And it’s been oh so long<br />That I’ve been feeling like this<br />And I know that I’ve never been more sure<br /><br />Tell me what you want, what you really want<br />Tell me what you need, what you want to believe<br />I’ve got the soul, and you’ve got to know<br />That together we have everything<br />My time was dim<br />My love was gone<br />My life was thin<br />Then you walked in<br /><br />And I said<br />Wait just a little while<br />And tell me where you’ve been<br />I’ve been staying up at night<br />Thinking about it<br />And it’s been oh so long<br />That I’ve been feeling like this<br />And I know that I’ve never been more sure{% endraw %}
