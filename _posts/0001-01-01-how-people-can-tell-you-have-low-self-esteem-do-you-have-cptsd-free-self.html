{% raw %}Do you have CPTSD? FREE SELF-ASSESSMENT QUIZ:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3Eaq8Qb">https://bit.ly/3Eaq8Qb</a> <br />***<br />Does your vibe instantly broadcast to other people that you feel &quot;less-than&quot;? I call this the Underdog Effect. For a lot of people with CPTSD -- even when you’re not conscious you’re doing it, you’re signaling to people your low self esteem. That hurts your ability to have positive relationships, and that, in turn, makes it harder to heal. In this video I teach about the subtle ways past experiences of abuse and neglect can seep into the ways you behave, the way you think, and the way you hold yourself a little apart from where you really want to be in life. I'll show you steps to take to change how you feel inside, so you can elevate the impression you make as a healed person.<br /><br />***<br />NEW COURSE!
