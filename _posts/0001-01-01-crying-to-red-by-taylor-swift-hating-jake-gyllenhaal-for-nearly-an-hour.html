So I just realized from a patreon member that this might have seemed like I was listening to RED TV and unfortunately it isn‚Äôt. That's on me - I'm sorry. This is the original RED from 2012. I wanted to listen to the original and get my real reaction so David and I could edit it and turn it around in time for the new re-release. So I‚Äôm sorry if that was misunderstood üôèüèº I‚Äôve since listened to the new versions and THAT uncut video will be up on patreon this week and then youtube like normal.<br /><br />~ timestamps ~<br />0:00 - 3:19 intro<br />3:20 - 5:11 state of grace<br />5:12 - 8:28 red<br />8:29 - 11:29 treacherous <br />11:30 - 15:05 I knew you were trouble<br />15:06 - 18:12 all too well<br />18:13 - 20:23 22<br />20:24 - 22:16 I almost do<br />22:17 - 24:52 we are never getting back together<br />24:53 - 26:50 stay stay stay<br />26:51 - 29:59 the last time ft. gary<br />30:00 - 32:16 holy ground<br />32:17 - 34:08 sad beautiful tragic<br />34:09 - 36:59 the lucky one<br />37:00 - 39:57 everything has changed ft. eddy boy<br />39:58 - 41:48 starlight<br />41:49 - 43:41 begin again<br />43:42 - 46:58 the moment I knew<br />46:59 - 49:01 come back... be here<br />49:02 - 51:09 girl at home<br />51:10 - 53:53 outro<br /><br />#TaylorSwift #RED{% endraw %}
