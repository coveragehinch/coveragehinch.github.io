{% raw %}A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. When this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be &quot;infected&quot; with a computer virus.<br /><br />The term &quot;virus&quot; is also misused by extension to refer to other types of malware. &quot;Malware&quot; encompasses computer viruses along with many other forms of malicious software, such as computer &quot;worms&quot;, ransomware, spyware, adware, trojan horses, keyloggers, rootkits, bootkits, malicious Browser Helper Object (BHOs), and other malicious software. The majority of active malware threats are trojan horse programs or computer worms rather than computer viruses.<br /><br />Computer viruses cause billions of dollars' worth of economic damage each year.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE!<br />▶️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/buyrzbre">https://tinyurl.com/buyrzbre</a>{% endraw %}
