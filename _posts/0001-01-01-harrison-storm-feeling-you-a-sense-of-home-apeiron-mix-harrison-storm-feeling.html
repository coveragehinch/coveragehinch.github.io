I was always so hesitant to write songs with other humans; it always felt like a process I wouldn't ever be able to share with someone. But, Sam changed that for me. We connected in the way we write, and the song came out of this instrumental chat we had about relationships and love. The song feels like an extension of that conversation we had. <br /><br />Change It All<br />I heard somewhere that your songs could start to feel like your children in a way, and this song feels like that for me. It represents a point in my life that I look back on with a lot of interest. I was at such a pivotal time and feeling like I didn't know what I was doing. That confusion came out over a week or two. It was poured into this song and marked a moment where I felt a strong connection between me wanting to control my own life and the mystery of how things unfold if you're in the right space with yourself emotionally. And treading those two forces, learning when to let go. <br /><br />Run<br />“Run&quot; speaks to a part of me with an idea of what I want my life to be like but will never become, or it's just always at arm's reach. It's wanting to be something that just isn't going to happen. When I wrote this song, I experienced a strong sense of escapism within a relationship. Getting lost in the notes' calming nature and the progression they fall into, daydreaming of another life. <br /><br />Be Slow<br />&quot;Be Slow&quot; is one of those songs I'd always wanted to write and came about in a natural way. Over the past few years, I've spent some time in the UK amongst tours writing music with two other incredible songwriters and producers, Nick Atkinson and Edd Holloway. W It was the perfect environment to write &quot;Be Slow&quot;; in their barn studio in the countryside during one of these sessions.<br /><br />Breathe Again<br />I received a poem after a break up that highlighted a lot of truths about that relationship. It was super revealing and shook me up quite a lot. I didn't know how to reply, but I had so much to say. The best way I felt I could do this was by replying in a song. Music says so much more often than words do directly, and I think the desperation of my vocals conveyed more than I ever could face-to-face. <br /><br />With You<br />A lot of my songs are quite personal, but this one feels even more so. It's a sincere love song I wrote right at the start of 2020 before the world fell into madness. The recording schedule for this song happened to be right in the middle of an intense lockdown here in Melbourne. Luckily, I live with my drummer and bassist to record drums, bass, cello, vocals, and guitar from our house. We had to teach ourselves how to make everything sound like we heard it in our heads, and the amazing Hayden Calnin mixed it all to make it sound like it does now. This song is really special to me.<br /><br />The Words You Say<br />&quot;This song is about those people who say one thing and then do something completely different. Especially when it comes to a relationship...I know it might not necessarily be their fault, but at the same time this song was written it seemed there was a very real intention behind the actions that were causing harm between us.&quot;<br /><br />Sense Of Home<br />It's is one of the first songs I wrote where I felt I started to explore creating something out of my inner world that meant a lot to me. Songwriting was (and still is) a slight mystery to me. There are times when you don't know what will come out, and this song, in particular, was revealing things to me that I was too afraid to admit or couldn't perceive properly at the time. Out of all of my songs, this one is a deep reminder to stay in tune with myself and listen to what I need. <br /><br />» Follow Nettwerk:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nettwerkmusic">https://www.instagram.com/nettwerkmusic</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/nettwerkmusicgroup">https://www.facebook.com/nettwerkmusicgroup</a><br /><br />» Picture: Matt Dodd<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mdodd16">https://www.instagram.com/mdodd16</a><br /><br />This is a collaboration with Nettwerk Records, the home of Harrison Storm. <br /><br />You could also listen to one of our many playlists: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/apeironsound/playlists">https://www.youtube.com/apeironsound/playlists</a><br /><br />Are you an artist?
