{% raw %}what i eat in a week | realistic healthy meals , my relationship with food + vlog<br /><br />Hi Guys,<br /><br />Happy weekend! I can't believe its Saturday already. I feel the time is flying by this year. This is our very last video of wellness month and honestly one of my favorite! I am so proud of each one of you for joining us. We have done more than 13 workouts all together. You guys inspire me to keep focusing on my own personal wellness, which inspires a lot of the videos I share!<br /><br />Especially with the pandemic I feel we have become so much closer and more connected on the internet. It's a beautiful thing that we are all able to workout together and motivate each other!<br /><br />This weekend I am going to take it easy. My plans are to go for a walk on the beach, do my laundry  and film a holiday gift guide for you guys. Do you have any fun or relaxing plans for the weekend?<br /><br />I am gonna be honest, I am looking forward to the holidays!  It felt a bit weird to get in the mood because its still pretty warm in L.A. , I see palm trees everywhere and I am not with my family. Max and I got a Christmas tree today to make our space a little more cozy and to get into the holiday spirits. In Dutch we will call this &quot; gezellig&quot;. Its a cozy, nice, warm ambience. I wish they had word in English for this haha!<br /><br />In todayâ€™s video I wanted to share some of my favorite healthy meals I like to eat during the week. I didn't get the chance to film everything but I wanted to show you guys most of it! If you have any questions for me about the recipes or something completely different,  let me know in the comments down below. I will try to do my best to respond to all of them.<br /><br />Also, I have a very EXCITING announcement to make tomorrow. So follow me on Instagram to stay tuned in my stories. Can you guess what I am about to tell you? ( tip: max and I have been working on this for a long time..)<br /><br />Big warm hugs,<br /><br />Sanne<br /><br />Follow me!<br />Instagram: @sannevloet (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2vlnHLy)">https://bit.ly/2vlnHLy)</a><br />Twitter: @sannevloet (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2OKggYH)">https://bit.ly/2OKggYH)</a><br />Subscribe!!! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2KzihS5">https://bit.ly/2KzihS5</a><br /><br />Follow the link to my gear page with everything I use to create content - B&amp;H Photo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/34XSsaj">https://bhpho.to/34XSsaj</a><br /><br />Music: <br />I used music from Epidemic Sound -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/GVgBV">http://share.epidemicsound.com/GVgBV</a><br />I used music from Music Bed - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.mscbd.fm/sannevloet">http://share.mscbd.fm/sannevloet</a>{% endraw %}
