{% raw %}#coffeechat #oatmilk #oatly <br />In this episode of a Coffee Chat in a Van, we are looking closely at Oat Milk. I give my impressions of a few brands of Oat Milk. And explain why I prefer Oatly Full Fat Oat Milk to any other. <br /><br />If you enjoy my videos and would like to help me keep making them, please take a look at these links to support me:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/static-campervan">https://teespring.com/stores/static-campervan</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/StaticCampervan">https://www.patreon.com/StaticCampervan</a><br />CashApp: $StaticCampervan<br />Venmo: @Static-Campervan<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/StaticCamperVan">https://www.paypal.me/StaticCamperVan</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZBrU4AS-d5AkcsP2fnugHA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZBrU4AS-d5AkcsP2fnugHA/join</a><br /><br />My name is Scott and in 2015, I bought a Ram ProMaster City to live in. Even though I didn’t know much about RV’s and campervans, I set about building the van out as a minivan camper. And in April of 2016, I moved into my minivan full time.<br />Over the years, I’ve learned you don’t need to have a big skill set to build your own campervan. And that living as a minimalist and utilizing solar power can be a less expensive way to live. I’ve also learned that a minivan can be a very comfortable home. <br />Please follow along as I document my journey.<br /><br />My Channel Stickers are now available for purchase through PayPal.
