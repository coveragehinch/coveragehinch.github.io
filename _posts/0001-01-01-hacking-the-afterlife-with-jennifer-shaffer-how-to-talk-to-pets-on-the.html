{% raw %}This is one of those unusual podcasts where again, no plan, just chatting with Jennifer.  And in this case, a dog came through that I knew 30 years ago - that I walked for three years for my then boss Robert Towne, Oscar winning screenwriter.<br /><br />Hira was a unique pet - treated me like a vassal, had a persona that I can remember thinking &quot;this isn't a dog. This is like a person who allows me to walk with him, rather than walk him.&quot;  Robert and Hira had a terrific bond, even though Robert had other dogs before and since.<br /><br />Some years ago, when I was talking to Robert about my research, he told me he was a skeptic, didn't believe in any version of there being an afterlife. And so, as a proof of concept, I scheduled a conversation with Jennifer and our mutual friend Ed Taylor, who passed away, but knew Robert from college.<br /><br />He came through clear as a bell, and towards the end of the interview, I asked if I could &quot;speak to Hira.&quot;  Jennifer had no idea who that was - but realized it was a dog. We had a detailed conversation with him - and have since then numerous times. Hira recalls so many events with specificity that I could not know, it forced Robert to say to me &quot;I was convinced my whole life that the afterlife didn't exist, and now I'm convinced it does. What happened?&quot;<br /><br />Experience happened.  Hira is only known to Robert - and not to me, really. But Robert and him spent time together, he credits Hira with Robert writing &quot;Chinatown&quot; because of the way he used to smell the air on Catalina.  He credits Hira with his writing &quot;Greystoke: Tarzan&quot; - because he realized how sentient of a being Hira was.<br /><br />So the idea that Hira would &quot;come through&quot; because he wanted to speak to us about &quot;how to communicate with animals&quot; is mind bending. I didn't invite him, wasn't thinking about him - nor was Jennifer. Luana Anders, our moderator on the flipside, the person with the clipboard, knew Hira.  And here he is - giving us new information about &quot;how to speak with your pet no longer on the planet.&quot;<br /><br />It's mind bending, and I know it's accurate because I've been doing this work for ten years.  It's fine for people to dismiss it, ignore it, even laugh about it - it doesn't change the fact that I've been getting new information from animals no longer on the planet during many of my filmed sessions. <br /><br />There are a few examples in the documentary &quot;Hacking the Afterlife&quot; on Gaia, and in the book &quot;Architecture of the Afterlife.&quot; Anyone can do the same - doesn't need a medium (it helps) doesn't need a hypnotherapist (it helps) or me giving them a guided meditation. <br /><br />Our loved ones are not gone, and our pets are not gone either.{% endraw %}
