{% raw %}Check out the incredible scenes from Goodison Park as Everton came from a goal down to defeat Arsenal in the Premier League. <br /><br />Richarlison was in inspired form and eventually got his 50th goal in English football , despite having two ruled out for offside after VAR reviews, to cancel out Martin Ã˜degaard's opener for the Gunners. <br /><br />Demarai Gray then sent Goodison into raptures as his stoppage-time rocket left Aaron Ramsdale with no chance as it whistled into the back of the net off the post. <br /><br />Subscribe to Everton Football Club's official YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2wtCEbB">http://bit.ly/2wtCEbB</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/everton">http://facebook.com/everton</a><br /><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/everton">http://twitter.com/everton</a><br /><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/everton">http://instagram.com/everton</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to the Official Everton Football Club YouTube channel.
