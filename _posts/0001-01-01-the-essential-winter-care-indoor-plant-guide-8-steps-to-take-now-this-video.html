{% raw %}This video is all about what you need to do to take care of your plants during the winter months.<br /><br />1. Watering: Reduce the amount of Water your plants are getting.  Use a moisture meter to tell if the plants need water.  You can bottom-water the plants in order to ensure the plants are watered when they are dry.<br />2.  Temperature. Do not let your plants stay in temperatures below 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Senecio and Cacti do in fact do well when it is cooler, as they prefer to go dormant.<br />3. Humidity: Use a humidifier if necessary, place a vase or tray with evaporating water,  or co-located your plants to increase humidity.<br />4. Light: Make adjustments to where you plants are and the exposure they are getting.<br />5. Fertilization:  Be careful not to fertilize during the winter months, unless you see that they are growing, in which case you can fertilize just a little bit.<br />6. Pruning: Wait until spring to cut you plants back.<br />7. Clean your plants.<br />8. Control pests.{% endraw %}
