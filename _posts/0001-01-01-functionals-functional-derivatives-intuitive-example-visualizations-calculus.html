{% raw %}We can minimize a Functional (Function of a Function) by setting the first Functional Derivative (=GÃ¢teaux Derivative) to zero. Here are the notes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceyron/machine-learning-and-simulation/main/english/math_basics/functional_derivatives.pdf">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceyron/machine-learning-and-simulation/main/english/math_basics/functional_derivatives.pdf</a><br /><br />A Function maps a scalar/vector/matrix to a scalar/vector/matrix. We have seen it multiple times, we know how to take derivatives etc. But now imagine something takes in a function and outputs a scalar/vector/matrix? At first this seems more complicated. Situations like these arise for instance in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics or when deriving probability density functions from a maximum entropy principle.<br /><br />But a more intuitive example: Say you want to take your car from Berlin to Munich. There are quite a lot of possible routes to take, each with a potentially different velocity and height profile. Now imagine you have a function that associates each point in time over the route with a position on the map. You could use this to deduce the height-and velocity profile. A Functional would now be a function that takes in the route and outputs the fuel consumption, i.e. mapping from a function to a scalar.<br /><br />Then, you might be interested in minimizing your fuel consumption, so you seek the minimum of a Functional. First Derivative equals zero, right? But how do you take the functional derivative.<br /><br />All of this and more will be answered in the video. ;)<br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00 Introduction<br />00:49 Can't we just use Newtonian Mechanics?<br />01:27 Defining Energies and Parameters<br />04:21 &quot;Average Difference in Energy&quot;<br />06:20 A Functional<br />07:11 Example 1<br />08:46 Example 2<br />09:56 Example 3<br />11:18 Comparing the Examples<br />12:20 Visualizing the Examples<br />13:23 Mathematical Definition of a Functional<br />15:22 Concept of Minimizing a Functional<br />16:22 Intro to the Functional Derivative<br />19:43 Example: Minimizing the Functional<br />22:53 Rearrange for y<br />25:38 Fundamental Lemma of Calculus of Variations<br />26:55 Rediscovering Newtonian Mechanics<br />28:07 Solving the ODE<br />29:31 Summary: Functional Derivatives<br />30:35 Outro{% endraw %}
