{% raw %}WELCOME to a Wandering Scholar production; To all my subscribers, it is my pleasure to see you back !<br /><br />London to New York is the world’s most lucrative airline route. It witnessed the evolution of commercial aviation and cultivated the financial capitals of the world. <br /><br />Among the oldest contenders to the route is British Airways, and the airline’s first class is also the most premium product offered when crossing the pond in a commercial jet. However, British Airways’ first class has always been relegated as the world’s best business class due to its reverse herringbone design that draws similarity with prevalent business class seats in the market. I arrived at London Heathrow with the expectation of flying business class. But I cannot resist the urge to become BA’s frequent flyer upon disembarking in New York Kennedy.<br /><br />British Airways introduced a “New” first class seat in late 2020. In line with the airline’s new Club Suite business class seat, the modified version of first class now contains a sliding door that can be closed to enhance privacy. Together with the airline’s solid inflight service and industry-leading Concord Room, the British First Class is charting its path to become the best transatlantic first class. <br /><br />If you enjoyed my video, please go to INSTAGRAM and follow【wandering_scholar】to watch live travel stories and to interact with me, a 19 years old frequent flyer from Shanghai.  <br /><br />Before you depart, the best way for you to support me should you wish to follow me on my scholarly journey in the world of aviation is by simply clicking the subscribe button and thumbs up.
