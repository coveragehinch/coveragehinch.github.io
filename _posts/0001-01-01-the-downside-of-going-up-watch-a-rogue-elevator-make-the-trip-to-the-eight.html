{% raw %}Watch a rogue elevator make the trip to the eight floor for this businessman a tough ride...<br /><br /><br /><br />This is my first stop-motion production, hopefully many to follow, had lots of fun making it!<br /><br /><br /><br />Directed, written, built and animated by: Rob Coenen<br /><br /><br /><br />Music and sound effects by: Musinc<br /><br /><br /><br />I would like to add that I never would have been able to make this video without the two fantastic books about stop-motion animation written by Ken Priebe, thx!{% endraw %}
