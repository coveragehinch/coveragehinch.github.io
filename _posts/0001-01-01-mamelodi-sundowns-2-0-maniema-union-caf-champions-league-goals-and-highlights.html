{% raw %}Mamelodi Sundowns defeated Maniema Union 2-0 on Sunday afternoon to secure a spot in the CAF Champions League group stages.<br /><br />Sundowns made four changes from the narrow win over Golden Arrows, as they recalled Themba Zwane, Rivaldo Coetzee, Lyle Lakay and Grant Kekana.<br /><br />The Brazilians were on the front foot in the opening exchanges and they came very close to going ahead in the seventh minute after Peter Shalulile's header from a corner was cleared off the goal-line.<br /><br />Maniema were offering resistance after that and it took a sublime free-kick from Lakay to break the deadlock for the hosts midway through the first stanza to put the hosts 3-2 ahead on aggregate.<br /><br />With Sundowns pinning the Congolese side in their own half in the closing phase of the first stanza, Thabiso Kutumela had a big chance to double their lead just before the half-time break after rounding Maniema goalkeeper to go through on goal on the left side of the box but he hit the side-netting. <br /><br />The visitors forced a save out of shot-stopper Denis Onyango early in the second stanza but their goalkeeper made a costly error eight minutes inside the second stanza after spilling a cross by Lakay and he was punished by Shalulile, who toe-poked the ball home on the goal-line, making it 2-0 and 4-2 on aggregate for Sundowns.<br /><br />Masandawana were dropping deep in their own half after getting a two-goal cushion and Maniema nearly pulled a goal back in the last 18 minutes after their overlapping left wing-back went through on goal but his looping strike hit the side-netting.<br /><br />Sundowns made a double attacking change in the last quarter of an hour, as Kermit Erasmus replaced Kutumela for fresh legs upfront and Neo Maema came on for Shalulile, in a tactical tweak.<br /><br />The Brazilians were comfortable in the dying minutes and managed to keep a cleansheet, as they booked their spot in the group stages while Maniema will have a second chance in the CAF Confederation Cup play-off round.{% endraw %}
