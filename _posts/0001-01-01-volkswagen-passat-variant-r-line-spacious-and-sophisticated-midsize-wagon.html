{% raw %}2019 Volkswagen Passat Variant R-Line - Drive and Design. Subscribe.<br /><br />Volkswagen will offer the business class best-seller with a new specification structure. The basic equipment has the designation Passat. Above this, the medium level profile is called Business. From now on, the top level is called Elegance. Business and Elegance can also be ordered with R-Line personalisation. As well as these versions, the new model will also again be available as a separate Alltrack model (all-wheel drive all-rounder with offroad capabilities) and also as a GTE. For the market launch, there will also be an exclusive special-edition model limited to 2,000 units: the all-wheel drive Passat R-Line Edition in the exclusive colour Moonstone Grey. On board here as standard: one of the two top engines (176 kW TDI or 200 kW TSI) and new assistance systems such as Travel Assist.<br /><br />Particulate filters as standard. An additional highlight is the newly developed 2.0 TDI Evo – a highly efficient turbo diesel engine with an output of 110 kW / 150 PS that produces 10 g/km less CO2 compared with the equivalent engine in the predecessor. The 2.0 TDI Evo is the forerunner of a new generation of diesel engines. The powerplant range also includes three petrol engines (TSI) with 110 kW / 150 PS, 140 kW / 190 PS, and 200 kW / 272 PS as well as three diesel engines (TDI); the latter deliver 88 kW / 120 PS, 140 kW / 190 PS, and 176 kW / 240 PS respectively. All TSI and TDI units fulfil the requirements of the Euro 6d-TEMP emission standard. In addition, every new Passat – whether a petrol or diesel engine – is equipped with a particulate filter.<br /><br />Travel Assist. IQ.DRIVE is the new umbrella brand for Volkswagen assistance systems. From now on, the technologies involved in autonomous driving will be bundled under the IQ.DRIVE label. An example is the new Travel Assist. The Passat will be the first Volkswagen that is capable of partially automated driving across practically the whole speed range (0 to 210 km/h). Along with its assistance system, the Passat represents the most advanced version of IQ.DRIVE yet seen.<br /><br />Capacitive steering wheel. Volkswagen builds on intuitive operation and technologies that function largely automatically. The new Passat will be the first Volkswagen worldwide with a capacitive steering wheel. It detects touch by the driver, providing an interactive interface to systems such as Travel Assist.<br /><br />Automatically safer. Emergency Steering Assist also sees its début in the Passat. The system improves safety during sudden evasive manoeuvres via braking intervention. In addition, the lane guidance with Lane Assist has been optimised with a new multifunction camera. The new IQ.LIGHT - LED matrix headlights also enhance safety and comfort.<br /><br />Permanently online. The third generation of the Modular Infotainment Matrix (MIB3) also has its début alongside the new Passat. App-Connect – the interface for integrating smartphone apps – offers wireless integration of iPhone apps via a wireless Apple CarPlay™ for the first time as a result. The Passat is now permanently online as the new Infotainment system also comes with an integrated online connectivity unit (OCU) complete with SIM card as standard. As well as improved navigation-related services with real-time information, this encompasses new technologies and offers, music streaming services, Internet radio, the use of updatable web app technology, natural voice control enriched with online content, the seamless use of online services provided by Volkswagen We, and future cloud-based portable vehicle settings. Smartphones (compatible Samsung models) also become a mobile key for opening and starting the Passat.<br /><br />New Digital Cockpit. The hardware and software in the MIB3 form a digitally linked unit with the Passat’s new Digital Cockpit. The digital instruments have been considerably enhanced compared to the previous system (Active Info Display). The enhanced high-contrast graphics display is clear and high-quality. The variety of functions has been lifted to a whole new level. Three various display configurations can now be customised via the new multifunction steering wheel at the touch of a button.<br /><br />LEDs refine the design. Volkswagen has fine-tuned the Passat’s design for an even more commanding presence on the road in either saloon or estate form. The front and rear bumpers, the radiator grille and the Passat logo, now located centrally at the rear, have all been redesigned. In addition, new LED headlights, LED daytime running lights, LED fog lights, and LED tail light clusters ensure a distinctive design. Colours like Lapiz Blue, Bottlegreen, and Sandgold are new to the Passat. In addition, four new styles of 17, 18, and 19-inch alloy wheels extend the wheel range.{% endraw %}
