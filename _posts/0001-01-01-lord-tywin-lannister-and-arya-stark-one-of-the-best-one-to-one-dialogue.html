{% raw %}One of the best one-to-one dialogue themes in GoT, which occurs between Lord Tywin Lannister and Arya Stark, while she is disguised and works as his cupbearer at Harrenhal. Sadly, I couldn't find any single video encompassing all their interactions, so edited a video myself.<br /><br />Events:<br />0:00 Arrival<br />1:33 The Young Wolf<br />3:10 A Letter<br />5:29 Tywin's Last War<br />6:53 Legacy &amp; History<br /><br />-----<br />Clips owned by HBO, and used from HBO's Game of Thrones S02 E04-07.{% endraw %}
