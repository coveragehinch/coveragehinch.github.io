I ask a few other species outside of predators for their opinion as well.  It is fun enriching the lives of captive wildlife.  They are captive for no condition of their own and I try to make their lives better by interacting and enriching their lives while trying to better understand them.  My future cheetah breeding and release project will focus on breeding cheetahs for release but there will be times I come across a rescue animal that may or may not be able to release.  I will attempt to enrich its life as much as possible before release or offer the best life possible with a 'forever home'.<br /><br />Catnip is a herb that has some pheromonal effect on some house cats.  The Africa Wild Cat is one of the genetic link to house cats.  I suspected they would appreciate Catnip the most.  What do you think?<br /><br />Thanks for watching!
