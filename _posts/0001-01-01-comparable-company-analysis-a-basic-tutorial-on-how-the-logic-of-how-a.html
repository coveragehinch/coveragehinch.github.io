{% raw %}A basic tutorial on how the logic of how a Comps Analysis works. Great for anyone interviewing for investment banking.<br /><br />Update 2021:<br /><br />Please find the models and walkthroughs here for download:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d0ticshlXRj1Vo9mC4S1rMDKHrD53vRP?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d0ticshlXRj1Vo9mC4S1rMDKHrD53vRP?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />We've since taken our site - Valuation University - down, and there won't be new content. Thanks for all the love over the years, our goal was to simplify concepts and create an easy-to-grasp educational platform for anyone breaking into finance, and we hope that we did just that. Good luck to everyone :){% endraw %}
