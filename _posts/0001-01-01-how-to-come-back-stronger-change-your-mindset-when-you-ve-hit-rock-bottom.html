The heartbreaking reality is that too many women have allowed pain to fester and keep them stuck in cycles of negative thinking and habits that do not serve their higher purpose. Natasha Grano (a.k.a. Natasha Graziano) is no exception. She is a woman like many of us. She’s experienced unimaginable pain from sexual trauma to physical sickness, and barely being able to provide for her baby. She’s opening up the book with Lisa to discuss how she started shifting her thinking and became aware of all the ways her thinking could attract positive change or create more negativity and heartache. She is an instagram influencer with over 7 million followers, a best selling author, a model and so much more. She’s dropping so much wisdom in this episode you’ll want to take notes.
