{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.truthforlife.org">https://www.truthforlife.org</a> || By: Alistair Begg —  Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the Lord’s temple acknowledged that no earthly dwelling could hold the God of creation. The wonder of the incarnation, Alistair Begg explains, is that an uncontainable God took on flesh and became Immanuel, “God with us.” God's plan has always been a person, not a place. Jesus’ glory outshone that of the temple, and His death enables us to draw near to God. Though ascended to heaven, Christ still dwells among His Church, a new temple of “living stones” unified by the work of the Holy Spirit.{% endraw %}
