{% raw %}#ChinaNews#Chip#3DPRINTING<br /><br />Hi everyone, welcome to Eyes of Real China. Eyes of Real China is focusing on Chinese latest and   prevalent news and events. With the environment of globalization, more and more people are following the changes of China. So we will show you what a real China is.   <br /><br />Lately, it is reported that the Chinese Academy of Sciences has made a breakthrough of the key core technologies of quantum computing and 3D printing, which showed the world the powerful scientific research strength. In fact, it is obvious that China has exerted to catch up with the world's advanced trends of high-end technology development. The significant achievements made in high-end technology fields such as chips and respirators has proved that China now is entering a era of high-end technology.<br /><br />Up to now, China's Chinese Academy of Sciences is focusing on two key technologies in the field of high-end technology. So, let's be patient and read the below article, then find out together what two key technologies China now is concentrating on.<br /><br />As we all know that in recent years, it is very eye-catching to people all over the world of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in China, such as graphene, photothermal distilled water and so on.As a result, in early November, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhang Pan propose a new model method for quantum computing with a crew from the Institute of Theoretical Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.<br /><br />The amplitude calculation of a big number of uncorrelated strings can be finished more more efficiently and conveniently by this new model method. And most importantly, it will be faster than the Platanus platanus quantum computer developed by Google in the United States. The United States quantum computer claims that it only takes more than three minutes for the calculation of 10,000 years. Once this new model of our country is put into practical use, it only takes tens of seconds under the premise of the same amount of calculation.{% endraw %}
