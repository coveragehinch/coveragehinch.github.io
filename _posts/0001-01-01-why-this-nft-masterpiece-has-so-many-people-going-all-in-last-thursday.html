{% raw %}Last Thursday we saw one of the biggest NFT mints of all time, and not many people are talking about it, even though it's one of the most affordable collections of its magnitude. <br /><br />The project is called Merge and it's the latest blockchain game from the pseudonymous artist known as Pak. In this video I talk about my first impression of Pak, why his new project could be a masterpiece and a great jumping in point for newbies, and the reasons why he/she has such a rabid fanbase. <br /><br />At the time of this video the secondary market game has not started yet. Expected to start 12/8/21. <br /><br />Follow me on twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GiancarloChaux">https://twitter.com/GiancarloChaux</a><br />--<br /><br /><br />0:00 start here<br />1:13 my thoughts on Pak...<br />2:24 why Pak is famous <br />3:27 Pak's collectors have made ALOT of money <br />4:52 How Merge works (important) <br />7:00 the potential returns <br />7:56 ASH erc-20 token <br />9:21 the simple bull thesis<br />10:00 two additional sources <br /><br /><br />OS collection: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://opensea.io/collection/m">https://opensea.io/collection/m</a><br />two more sources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDefiant">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDefiant</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shortshoward.substack.com/">https://shortshoward.substack.com/</a>{% endraw %}
