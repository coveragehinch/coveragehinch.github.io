{% raw %}Hazards and Risks in the Workplace<br /><br />Life is filled with risks caused by hazards that we encounter as part of daily life - that we learn to handle from the time we are born. <br />In this video, we learn what is a hazard, and what is a risk and the difference between the two. We take a look at the five categories of workplace hazards and some examples of each. <br /><br />Copyright Eduworks Resources, 2021{% endraw %}
