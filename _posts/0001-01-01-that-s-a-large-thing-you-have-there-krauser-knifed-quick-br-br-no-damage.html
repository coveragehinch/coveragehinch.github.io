{% raw %}Krauser knifed quick ^^<br /><br />No damage<br /><br /><br /><br />He can be knifed quicker, in 30 seconds, if you're able to corner him. That's the way most people beat him with Leon. You can disrupt some of his attacks with the knife. In this video, I show you how to take advantage of his jumping attack, that has the longest recovery phase. ^^<br /><br /><br /><br />NOTE: Take a look at my video &quot;Separate ways no merchant run Chapter 5 pt3&quot;. In this video, I knife krauser without the continue point cheat. He recquires 8 stabs instead of 5.<br /><br /><br /><br />NOTE: I didn't include the section after the tower battle, because there's nothing new there. A lot of crossbow ganados to knife, and two J.J. There're enough stairs for the job =P{% endraw %}
