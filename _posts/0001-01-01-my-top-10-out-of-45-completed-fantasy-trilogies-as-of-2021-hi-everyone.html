{% raw %}Hi everyone! Today’s video will be the top 10 completed fantasy trilogies that I’ve read so far. This video is ranked based on the 45 completed fantasy trilogies I finished reading so far. After receiving a lot of requests for this video, and now that we’re near the end of 2021, I think it’s the right time to post this recommendation video. There are still so many fantasy trilogies I want to read, and I will make sure to update this list again once I’ve read about 10 or 20 more finished fantasy trilogies. Let me know your thoughts on this list, and what’s your favorite completed fantasy trilogies?<br /><br />Note: This list won’t have a direct sequel trilogy, that in my opinion, definitely require reading the previous series first to fully appreciate. I will save my recommendation for the best sequel trilogy/series for future videos.<br /><br />Channel mentioned:<br />@Elliot Brooks <br /><br />Trilogies Mentioned:<br />0:00 Intro<br />1:43 The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb<br />3:00 The Winnowing Flame Trilogy by Jen Williams<br />4:19 The Poppy War Trilogy by R.F.
