{% raw %}📺 Check out the extended cut of this video on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/bkxc">http://patreon.com/bkxc</a><br /><br />&quot;The views, the terror, the total package.&quot;<br /><br />It was great to show Patrick (@crappypatty) Hangover for the first time. Sedona has three really tough and fantastic rides that keep people coming back every year: Hiline, Hogs and Hangover. This is the toughest of the bunch, with high consequences everywhere you look. Sometimes it feels more like mountaineering than mountain biking.<br /><br />* Trailforks ridelog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.trailforks.com/ridelog/view/32492258/">https://www.trailforks.com/ridelog/view/32492258/</a><br /><br />1️⃣ Trail One Components now in stock! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://trailone.bike">https://trailone.bike</a><br /><br />🚲 I'm sponsored by IBIS and ride a RIPMO.
