{% raw %}House of Representatives Debates : Corporations Amendment (Improving Outcomes for Litigation Funding Participants) Bill 2021<br /><br />This Orwellian named Bill does the exact opposite . <br /><br />It uses Soviet style 'price controls' which will only make it more difficult for Australian small business to access justice. <br /><br />Shame on the Liberal Government for pushing such legislation which will only protect the big end of town.{% endraw %}
