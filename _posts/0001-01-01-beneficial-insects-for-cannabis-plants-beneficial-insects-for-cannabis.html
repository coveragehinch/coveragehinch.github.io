{% raw %}Beneficial Insects for Cannabis Plants<br /><br />Professor DeBacco<br /><br /><br />List of Beneficial Insects<br />Syrphid Flies<br />Green Lacewings<br />Collops Beetles<br />Damsel Bugs<br />Spined Solder Bugs<br />Minute Pirate Bugs<br />Lady Beetles<br /><br /><br /><br />Syrphid Flies (Flower Flies, Hover Flies)<br />Most beneficial for targeting mostly slow-moving, soft-bodied insects such as mealybugs and especially aphids.<br />Can also attack scale, and some species of thrips.<br /><br /><br /><br />Green Lacewings<br />Adults feed on nectar, pollen, and honeydew, while the larvae are active predators of soft-bodied insect pests: aphids, thrips, whitefly, leafhoppers, spider mites (especially red mites) and mealybugs.<br />Purchase Larvae as this is the most advantageous for immediate treatment of a pest problem<br />Purchase Adults if you are seeking to establish a population<br /><br /><br /><br />Collops Beetles<br />They are important predators for soft-bodied insects like whiteflies (all stages), small Lygus nymphs, aphids, mites, and lepidopteran eggs and caterpillars.<br />These can be important for the natural control of whiteflies in field applications along with selective insecticides. <br /><br /><br /><br />Damsel Bugs<br />They are predators of aphids, moth eggs, and small caterpillars, including corn earworm, European corn borer, imported cabbageworm and some armyworms. <br />Other prey may include leafhoppers, small sawfly larvae, mites, tarnished plant bug nymphs, and asparagus beetle and Colorado potato beetle eggs and nymphs.<br /><br /><br /><br />Spined Assassin Bugs<br />There are different species of assassin bugs<br />One of the largest (in size) of the insect predators<br />Typically feed on the various caterpillars such as corn earworm, zebra caterpillar, and yellow striped armyworm<br /><br /><br /><br />Minute Pirate Bugs<br />One of the most common general predators in field crops but can also be used for indoor growing environments.<br />Emerging early in the spring, their diet consists of a variety of small pests which include thrips and white fly nymphs and aphids (as seen in the images)<br />They reproduce quickly, completing a total life cycle in just 3-4 weeks, making them effective at handling serious infestations quickly.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lady Beetles (Ladybugs)<br />There are different species of Lady Beetles<br />They are natural enemies of many insects, especially aphids and other sap feeders.<br /><br />Some species prefer mite or scale populations so if using them as a biological control check to make sure you are maximizing their effectiveness for your situation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Link to Lecture Slides: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12hipIG27eCb0p45ZmAQvwz0TPg2W-Pj8/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/12hipIG27eCb0p45ZmAQvwz0TPg2W-Pj8/view?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />*Due to the description character limit the full work cited for &quot;Beneficial Insects for Cannabis Plants&quot; can be viewed at... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1avNPiPKIUFACVS3OQXsvPzBQ-cF24eHk/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1avNPiPKIUFACVS3OQXsvPzBQ-cF24eHk/view?usp=sharing</a>{% endraw %}
