{% raw %}Permitting a foundation repair can be a daunting task whose time consumption and cost can be overwhelming if you don't know what to expect. This video explores a brief introduction to the process of permitting, so homeowners can be aware of the litany of tasks that goes into permit acquisition and closure. <br /><br />***<br /><br />Does your home have cracks in the walls, roof, or foundation? Do doors and windows stick, or swing freely? Is there obvious sloping of your flooring, or does your floor appear &quot;wavy&quot;, or creak at night when you step over areas? Are gaps appearing frames and roof-wall or wall-floor transitions? You can guess none of this is exactly &quot;supposed&quot; to happen, but these are all symptoms of foundation movement. <br /><br />Now, not ALL of them individually is necessarily foundation movement, it could be the flexing of wood seasonally, poor installation, or a myriad of other things. But if it IS foundation movement, how does one take on the arduous task of analyzing foundation movement problems, or even understanding what engineers and contractors are telling you? Who is pushing an agenda or a product, trying to make their dollar while your GREATEST ASSET - YOUR home - is what's at risk? <br /><br />Hi, my name is Kyle Olsen and I've got 17 years of foundation leveling and stabilization, from the realm of designing and implementing repairs, coordinating engineers and city inspectors, and yeah even the ugly legal side of things. But let's not go there. These videos are designed to help you understand each facet of foundation leveling and stabilization, whether your home is heaving or settling, and I will walk through the process 100% of the way - without pushing a product or service. <br /><br />I encourage you to like, follow, subscribe, and share, my first several videos are for Homeowners, Flippers, and Realtors, sticking to the basics and trying to avoid some of the Engineering nuances. In the future, I hope to bring Engineers together for furthering education on some of the products and methods out there. <br /><br />If you have questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to leave a comment below or message me directly. Want to see another video covering something specific or elaborating on something? Just ask! This channel is all about foundation leveling and stabilization, because we believe that as long you're on the level, you won't go downhill...{% endraw %}
