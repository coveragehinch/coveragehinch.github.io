{% raw %}A woman who lost her right index and middle finger, as well as the top of her thumb, demonstrated in a November 24 TikTok video the use of her rose-gold prosthetic fingers in Centralia, Washington.<br /><br />The video, shot by Natasha Baggett, shows her use of the prosthetics, with Baggett turning a car key, opening compartments on her dashboard, and picking up a cup.<br /><br />“So some people have been asking to see some everyday normal tasks I can accomplish with my prosthetic fingers,” she says in the video. “And I’m testing out this new rose-gold color on my prosthetic and I thought it’d be the perfect chance to show you guys what I can do.”<br /><br />Baggett told Storyful she had an “accident while making a laptop table for a wheelchair-bound boy” last year.<br /><br />“My saw kicked back and sent the board I was working on into the air,” she said. “On the board’s way down, it smacked my hand into the blade.”<br /><br /><br /><br />Credit: Natasha Baggett via Storyful<br />Original video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@baberhamlincoln6523/video/6898767754350841093">https://www.tiktok.com/@baberhamlincoln6523/video/6898767754350841093</a><br />--------------------------<br />To purchase this video for media use visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://video.storyful.com">http://video.storyful.com</a> <br /><br />For Storyful Newswire subscription inquiries, please contact sales@storyful.com<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/storyful">https://twitter.com/storyful</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Storyful">https://www.facebook.com/Storyful</a>{% endraw %}
