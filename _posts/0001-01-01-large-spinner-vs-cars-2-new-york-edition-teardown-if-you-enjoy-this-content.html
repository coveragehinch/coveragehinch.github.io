{% raw %}If you enjoy this content, please like and Subscribe! It really helps a lot :)<br />Also, come say hi on discord!<br />I decided it was time to make a sequel to my most popular video. Large Spinner vs Cars just screams for a sequel. In fact many of my videos do, so expect more. This time I modified the Mini New York map to feature a quadruple city and a spinner center for maximum destruction. I chose all the best vehicles and all the best clips. We have yet again tanks, military vehicles, buses, construction vehicles, explosive vehicles, trucks and vans ... everything. Watch how all of new york's most prominent buildings collapse after being hit as the vehicles fly through the air crashing into buildings dealing massive damage as they attempt to stop the large spinner. I hope you enjoy this video :)<br />There is a special new outro screen too!<br /><br />Join Discord Server :)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/PCkNw2MGzw">https://discord.gg/PCkNw2MGzw</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHJ50h0N_dyUr9aSm_7vBA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHJ50h0N_dyUr9aSm_7vBA/join</a><br /><br />If you're feeling generous you can buy me a coffee!
