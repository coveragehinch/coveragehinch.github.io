{% raw %}&quot;I should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.&quot;<br /><br />FINALLY SOME HD QUALITY! I watched this the day it was released at cinema, then went again the next weekend as I loved it so much! I have been drumming my fingers til I got better quality footage to make a video. <br /><br />I know with all Austen adaptations everyone has their favourite, this is by far my favourite of Emma. Casting was great, the cinematography, so much sexual tension, loved their chemistry. <br /><br />It definitely cheered me up after my Sanditon glum!<br /><br />Please rate and comment :) <br /><br />STAY SAFE IN THIS PANDEMIC! <br /><br />Film: Emma (2020), dir. Autumn de Wilde<br />Song: Novo Amor - Carry You<br /><br />#Emma2020 #JaneAusten #fanvidfeed #perioddrama{% endraw %}
