{% raw %}Tractor Time with Tim takes the Ventrac 4500P to southern Indiana where he puts it to the test. Vinny shows just how tough cutting is done by clearing a wooded hill quickly. Our John Deere 1025R nor a zero turn mower would have accomplished this task. Corey, the homeowner, was evaluating the Ventrac for the needs on his hilly property. <br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://TractorTimewithTim.com">http://TractorTimewithTim.com</a><br /><br />Favorite Products: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amazon.com/shop/TractorTimeWithTim">http://amazon.com/shop/TractorTimeWithTim</a><br /><br />TTWT Merchandise: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://TractorTimeWithTim.com/shop">http://TractorTimeWithTim.com/shop</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/TractorTimeWithTim">http://facebook.com/TractorTimeWithTim</a>{% endraw %}
