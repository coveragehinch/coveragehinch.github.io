Cole]<br />Okay, back when I was sleepin' in my mama's crib<br />Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib<br />Payin' seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent<br />No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?<br />Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you<br />Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you<br />Childish shit, you know childish shit<br />Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit<br />Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip<br />Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now<br />The same clubs that I used to get tossed out<br />Life got crisscrossed, Totally Krossed Out<br />Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out<br />Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out<br />But I'm still on you, I'm still on you<br />My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you<br />I'm saying...<br /><br />[Hook 2: Miguel &amp; J. Cole]<br />Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?<br />Baby, I want you to want me<br />Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?<br />Baby, I want ya<br />And we are, we are, we are<br />Got me up all night<br />And we are, we are, we are<br />All I'm singin' is love songs<br />And we are, we are, we are<br />Got me up all night<br />And we are, we are, we are<br />She got me<br />And we are, we are, we are<br />She got me<br /><br />[Verse 2: J. Cole]<br />Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever<br />If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever<br />Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever<br />And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?<br />She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga<br />Wifin' in the club, man my homies gon' disown a nigga<br />Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla<br />Ass stupid, how you get to college, college<br />I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now<br />Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now<br />Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche?<br />I used to pop up on you at the mall each day<br />Now typically I kick game like Eastbay<br />But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', &quot;Please play!&quot;<br />For Pete's sake, homie pull it together<br />Just fuck her one time and be through it forever<br />But...<br /><br />[Hook 2]<br /><br />[Hook 1]{% endraw %}
