{% raw %}PNF Stretching is a great way to release the abductor muscles which are often involved in hip, low back, knee pain, and lower extremity problems. There are three PNF methods: the contract-relax method (CR), the antagonist-contract method (AC), and a combination of the two – contract-relax-antagonist-contract (CRAC).
