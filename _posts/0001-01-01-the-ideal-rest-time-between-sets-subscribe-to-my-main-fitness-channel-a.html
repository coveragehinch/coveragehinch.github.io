Stop worrying about specific rest between set intervals and just take as long as you require to where you feel that you can execute the next set at your full muscular potential.‚Å£ This can vary hugely depending on which specific bodybuilding exercise you're performing, how close to failure you're going (RPE/RIR), where you are in the workout and just how you feel physically/mentally on any given day.‚Å£ Based on that it could be anywhere from 1.5 minutes up to 5 minutes or more.‚Å£<br />‚Å£<br />Caveat:‚Å£ Whenever I bring this topic up, people often ask how things like rest pause, myo reps or drop sets factor into this since those are techniques I've mentioned before and personally use that involve very short rest periods.‚Å£ The reason why this differs is because the additional &quot;sets&quot; you perform beyond the initial one are just small clusters of reps and so they don't accrue the same systemic fatigue as performing an entirely new full length set.‚Å£ For example, I might perform a rest pause set where I do 10 reps to failure, rest for anywhere from 15-30 seconds, then perform another 5 reps, take that same short rest, then finish with another 3-4 reps.‚Å£ Since the muscle is already close to its failure point and the follow up sets (if you even want to call them sets) are low rep, things like cardiovascular fatigue, mental fatigue etc. don't end up being limiting factors.‚Å£<br /><br />#fitness #gym #workout #buildmuscle #bodybuilding{% endraw %}
