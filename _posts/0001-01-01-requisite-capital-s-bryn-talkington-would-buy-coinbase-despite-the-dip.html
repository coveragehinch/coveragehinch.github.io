Coinbase said in the report that bitcoin accounted for 19% of trading volume, and ethereum accounted for 22%. The remaining 59% came from other crypto assets, an increase from 50% in the second quarter.<br /><br />Assets on the platform swelled to $255 billion from $180 billion at the end of June. About 55% of that is from institutional investors with the rest from retail.<br /><br />Coinbase held its stock market debut in April at $381 a share and was briefly valued at high as $100 billion, on a fully diluted basis. The stock sank below $221 in July but has rallied dramatically in the past month, closing on Tuesday at $357.39.<br /><br />Net revenue more than quadrupled from a year earlier to $1.23 billion. However, it was down from over $2 billion in the second quarter. Coinbase said it expects retail monthly transacting users and total trading volume in the fourth quarter to be higher than in the third.<br /><br />In September, the company scrapped plans to launch a crypto lending product after it revealed that the SEC planned to sue over the product. Also during the quarter, Coinbase announced plans to launch a marketplace to trade nonfungible tokens and allowed customers to deposit paychecks into their accounts.<br /><br />Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms, recently said it hired Coinbase to deal with logistics for its new digital wallet for cryptocurrencies.<br /><br />» Subscribe to CNBC TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC</a><br />» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic">https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic</a> <br /><br />Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
