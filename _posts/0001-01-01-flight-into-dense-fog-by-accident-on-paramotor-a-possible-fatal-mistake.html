{% raw %}6am, I fixed a cup of coffee, walked outside.  I checked the forecast before I even got out of bed.  &quot;Patchy dense fog until 9am&quot;  Visual observations showed 1 mile visibility, patchy low fog.  The kind of fog we've all flown over dozens of time.  I even took the extra step of flying up a drone and looking around to find that magical dreamscape of bubbly fog with treetops poking out of it everywhere...Kyle O puts on a paramotor, launches, music playing.  I think it was Rocketman by Elton John.  Now here is the thing about weather.  It changes.  Forecast are wrong sometimes.  Even for professionals, it's still a guess.  At some point in your flying, it will surprise you.  For me, this surprise has happened twice.  Today was the worst kind of surprise. Visibility immediately dropped to zero, I lose reference to the ground.  I started an immediate descent, and found trees, only trees.  I'm lost.  My property, and the area surrounding it is an obstruction obstacle course.   No good for getting lower and hoping for the best.  I need better odds.  Violations of laws and regulations is no longer a thought I can dwell on.  I'm now operating in the interest of the safety of human life.  On a personal note, this is not my first venture into the white room, I've logged somewhere in the realm of 20 hours instrument training in airplanes.  10 hours real IMC flying.  Also, a few times paragliding inside clouds outside of the USA.  My thought, &quot;This is now game time&quot;.  I climb.  Our craft have an advantage in IMC in that if you just sit in it, it'll fly level. That's not the case with fixed wing craft, so my thoughts ease slightly.   After a spooky 30-40 second climb, I poke out of the top to find the entire planet blanketed in a white quilt.  I'm stuck on top.  I do a bit of soul searching while watching the sunrise.  Though I'm stuck and lost, I breathe easy, I can only control myself.  It's a beautiful sunrise.  I take an inventory:  4 liters fuel, gps capable phone.  Red Hot Chili Peppers &quot;Breaking the Girl&quot; is now playing.  I open GPS to find a strong signal.  I open the map.  Dang, I'm over a swamp.  No good options.   The headwind matches the sunrise, so I dump trimmers to the fast setting, and push.  I'm now over my area.  I'm continually looking for holes to descend through.  There are none.  I'm at 2 liters of fuel, and have to calculate my odds.  &quot;Rock Superstar&quot; by Cypress Hill is now playing.  The fog is growing thicker, there are still no holes in it.  I'm fully oriented, mentally focused.  If I run out of fuel, and botch it, I lose.  I need to go in while things are running.  There are large pastures around my property.  I select my safest option.  I setup an approach into the largest field on the downwind side.  I must calculate my glide slope mentally based on groundspeed, and altitude.  I can only see the GPS map, and fiddling with the phone with gloves on is a trip to ridiculous town.  I smile because I'm good at math.  I go in.  Spooky time again, about a minute of spooky time.  I arrive into the field at 100 feet AGL, turn toward my property, and land.  I wanted to write down this debrief while it was fresh.  Other than, a no go, not sure how this could have been avoided...Update.  I have the drone footage.  The last frame of this timelapse was what I saw 1 minute before launching.  After processing the video, you can clearly see the fog bank moving in.  My observation was this last photograph which still looks pretty benign.<br /><br />Paramotor Instructional techniques offered by Kyle O, and how I run my paramotor school in this video here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/WXRC3SmY-SI">https://youtu.be/WXRC3SmY-SI</a><br /><br />Shipping Address:<br />Kyle O'Glee<br />531 S Main St<br />Springhill, LA 71075<br /><br />My school group page:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/219727948582147/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/219727948582147/</a><br /><br />Best way to contact me initially is thru email.  <br />kyleoschoolofparamotor@gmail.com<br /><br />My personal facebook page:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/kyle.oglee">https://www.facebook.com/kyle.oglee</a><br /><br />Like my content?
