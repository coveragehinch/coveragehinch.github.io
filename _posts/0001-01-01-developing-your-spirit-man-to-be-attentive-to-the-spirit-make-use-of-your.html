{% raw %}Make use of your spirit man and listen to the Holy Spirit. <br />‘Be Attentive To His Spirit’ . You have two natures, the natural man and the spiritual man. But many people’s spiritual nature is shut down. They are not attentive to the Spirit of God. You will be inattentive, if you are not in His Word, because His Word is His voice. If Jesus is your Lord, then listen to His Spirit. God will direct a life that is submitted to Him. <br />Truly lives are changed by an encounter with Jesus.<br />God loves you, and may He bless your life as you follow Jesus,<br />Mark Hemans<br />Jesus Encounter Ministries<br /> <br />TO REGISTER FOR MIRACLE MEETINGS:<br />www.jesusencounterministries.com/schedule<br />Kindly send any prayer requests via the website, and not Messenger or Youtube.<br />Join the ENCOUNTER MINISTRIES GROUP at  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/354562954594850/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/354562954594850/</a><br />SUBSCRIBE to Youtube<br />PODCASTS on Spotify <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/48dDhSV5DSyqWxt8xXiijY?si=GQpbVBdaQ9ClgXjmRpfYBg&amp;fbclid=IwAR3twjqx9eOKG2hZh2rcm2otFKO8XrwYDg0H422ysU3TsC3en3kn04yGbtY">https://open.spotify.com/show/48dDhSV5DSyqWxt8xXiijY?si=GQpbVBdaQ9ClgXjmRpfYBg&amp;fbclid=IwAR3twjqx9eOKG2hZh2rcm2otFKO8XrwYDg0H422ysU3TsC3en3kn04yGbtY</a><br />VOLUNTEER  as an intercessor or prayer helper:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jesusencounterministries.com/contactus/volunteer">https://www.jesusencounterministries.com/contactus/volunteer</a><br />PRAYER REQUESTS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jesusencounterministries.com/contactus/prayer-request">https://www.jesusencounterministries.com/contactus/prayer-request</a><br />SHARE YOUR TESTIMONY:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jesusencounterministries.com/contactus/testimony">https://www.jesusencounterministries.com/contactus/testimony</a> <br />TO DONATE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jesusencounterministries.com/donate">https://www.jesusencounterministries.com/donate</a>{% endraw %}
