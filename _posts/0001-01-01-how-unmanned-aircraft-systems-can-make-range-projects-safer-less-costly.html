{% raw %}Credit: Stephen Baack | Date Taken: 02/27/2020<br />A group of Huntsville Center professionals gathered Feb. 27, 2020, at the Rocket City Radio Controllers complex in southeast Huntsville to evaluate the capabilities of three different unmanned aircraft systems to find ways to make range projects more efficient and less costly. (Note: This event took place before social distancing guidance was released.) The group included professionals with different technical specialties to evaluate a diverse set of potential applications. One of those applications is munitions identification. The team set up 25 different kinds of inert munitions and explosives of concern on the complex field and then put each unmanned aircraft through its paces to test a multitude of sensors they had placed aboard the aircraft.{% endraw %}
