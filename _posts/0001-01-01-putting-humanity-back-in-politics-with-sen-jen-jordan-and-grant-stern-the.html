{% raw %}On today's episode of The MeidasTouch Podcast we two incredible guests, Georgia’s State Senator and Candidate for Attorney General Sen. Jen Jordan and writer Grant Stern! During the interview with Sen. Jordan, we discuss what she can do to protect women in Georgia if Roe is overturned, election integrity and Kanye West’s publicist (?) trying to force a false confession from a Georgia election official. The remainder of the episode, the brothers discuss the tornadoes that hit midwestern and southern US states, CA Gov. Newsom’s response to the abortion ban and new information detailing Mark Meadows involvement in the Jan 6. insurrection.  We close the episode with a bombshell report from Grant Stern! Stern’s report (which can be found at grantstern.substack.com) unearths how Sidney Powell was mis-representing &amp; not properly disclosing important legal filings in Florida and the potential repercussions from this action.
