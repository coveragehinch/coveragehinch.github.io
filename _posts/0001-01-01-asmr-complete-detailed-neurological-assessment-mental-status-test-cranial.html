{% raw %}Today's video was researched using a different resource than normal: a 1997 edition of the Merck Manual of Medical Information.

I don't tolerate discrimination or hatred based on attributes you can't change like where you were born, what color you are, if you have a disability, or who you love‚Äì above all, be kind to one another. We're all just people, just trying to do our thing.<br /><br />‚ù•I upload on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays every week, and usually a new medical video every Sunday! (there may be fluctuations due to chronic illness)<br /><br />‚ù• If you want to donate (but don't ever feel pressured to!) I have two ways to go about it:<br />Ko-Fi link (one-time): ko-fi.com/calliopewhispersasmr<br />Patreon link (monthly perks like early access videos &amp; exclusive content): patreon.com/calliopewhispers<br /><br />‚ù• Check me elsewhere on the Web:<br />The Big List Of It All: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/xxcalliope">https://linktr.ee/xxcalliope</a><br />Twitter: @xx_calliope<br />TikTok: @xx_calliope<br />Instagram: @xx_calliope<br /><br />‚ù• Frequently Asked Questions:<br />- ‚ÄúWhy do you ask for a preferred name &amp; address?‚Äù While I'm a cisgender woman, I'm very aware of my audience having members that don't use their 'legal' names (I'm one of them) and use specific pronouns, or are questioning their names and given pronouns. It's just common courtesy to make everyone more comfortable here. Even if it doesn't apply to you, it may apply to others and makes the world of difference.<br />- ‚ÄúWhy do you ask for consent to touch (even if it's a given)?‚Äù Coooommon courtesy; big thing with me. I hate being touched by anyone I don't know, but being asked even if I know I'm going to have to anyway is much more comfortable than someone putting their paws on me without warning. Common courtesy.<br />- ‚ÄúIs your name really Calliope? How do you say it?‚Äù Yup. It's pronounced Ka-Lie-Oh-Pee, not Kal-Ee-Ope.<br /><br />‚ù• Channel intro created by Bearded Audio ASMR (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJVQJE8WNtZenEzlzpnuA2A)">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJVQJE8WNtZenEzlzpnuA2A)</a> :) background image is ‚ÄúClose-up Photo of Green Leafed Plant‚Äù from user Aditya Aiyar on pexels.com, no attribution required.<br /><br />‚ù• My equipment:<br />Audio Recording ‚Äì Rode NT1-A Microphones, 3Dio XLR Binaural Microphone, Blue Yeti Microphone,  Roland CS-10EM Binaural Microphones<br />Filming ‚Äì Lumix G85 Camera<br /><br />‚ù• Like &amp; comment if you enjoyed this video, subscribe if you want to see more!<br /><br />‚ù• Thanks for watching, have a whale of a day! :)<br /><br />#asmr #asmrroleplay #asmrexam{% endraw %}
