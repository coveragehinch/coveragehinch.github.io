{% raw %}A look at what befell the elves of Immoren between the Claiming and the Iron Kingdoms as they changed for IKRPG: Requiem.<br /><br />Warriors of WMH – Evolution in Hubris transcript link (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17luthNP9cR6D-yfTKzJT8a6UGJfrOQJm2aeGAISV5nc/edit?usp=sharing)">https://docs.google.com/document/d/17luthNP9cR6D-yfTKzJT8a6UGJfrOQJm2aeGAISV5nc/edit?usp=sharing)</a><br /><br />Addendum – the first bit is a not-so-subtle plug of a homebrew IKRPG: Requiem quick shot campaign I ran for a local group who were blissfully unaware of just how spoileriffic it was. As to the rest, it really would not do to spoil everything, so the viewer is invited to speculate answers to the questions towards the end (and whether they may or may not be answered in the book at all, don’t worry at least some of them are), along with how much the narrator related accurately or was subject to the unreliability of a deeply affected witness. Bear in mind, there is further context to add as the story of the elves of Ios is not yet over. This is merely their latest chapter, and worth bearing in mind: their destruction doesn’t sell minis for Privateer Press(!)<br /><br />Note of thanks – despite having written the source material (albeit only as a contributor as opposed to establishing its continuity), I nonetheless extend my gratitude to Matt Goetz and Privateer Press for giving me the opportunity to present it here.<br /><br />Feel free to follow me on FaceBook at (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Servant-Of-Nyrro-117684376484497/)">https://www.facebook.com/Servant-Of-Nyrro-117684376484497/)</a><br />Should you so wish to, you may support the channel at (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/ServantOfNyrro)">https://www.paypal.me/ServantOfNyrro)</a><br /><br />Disclaimer<br />This is an unofficial lore video and is not promoted, sponsored or endorsed by Privateer Press or any party financially or legally related to Privateer Press.
