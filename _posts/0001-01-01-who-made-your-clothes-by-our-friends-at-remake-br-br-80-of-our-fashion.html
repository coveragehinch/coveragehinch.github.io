{% raw %}By our friends at Remake:<br /><br />80% of our fashion is made by women (mostly 18-24 years old) but we only hear about these millennial makers when they're associated with a tragedy like Rana Plaza in Bangladesh in 2013 or the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York in 1913. Their stories are eclipsed by heartbreaking headlines that hound the fashion industry. <br /><br />But there is another part of this story. It’s a story of hope. Remake has traveled to factories and dormitories throughout the world in search of the women who never make the headlines. Kashmiri who opens the yarn to make it into fabric. Maud and Rubina who stitch our blouses and jeans together. Anju who pulls out loose threads and inspects everything to ensure perfection. Each has a story and a hope for a very different future. <br /><br />Meet the women behind fashion’s supply chain -- we followed them from Haiti to Pakistan to China -- and asked each of them to share a message to you, the end shopper.
