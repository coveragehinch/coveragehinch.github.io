{% raw %}PYRRHIC SALVATION - Those That Dwell<br />EP: PYRRHIC SALVATION - Manifestum I<br />Genre: &quot;Raw&quot; Technical Death Metal w/ Black Metal and Dissonant Death Metal influences<br />Location: Burlington, Vermont üá∫üá∏<br />For fans of: Gorguts, Anata, Blotted Science, Origin, Hate Eternal, Spawn of Possession, Ulcerate, Artificial Brain, Necrophagist, Vital Remains<br />_____________ <br /><br />&quot;We wanted to bring the idea that technical death metal with a variety of influences can be done with a very raw, unfiltered voice to it, and the result was kind of unexpected with all of this. It was kind of what we all wanted to hear, being that a lot of studio process in death metal-- while it sounds great and is purposed-- is also very perfected. We aimed to take that away from what we were doing, so if you hear us mess up somehow, it‚Äôs because we are still just people trying to play this. We do our best and no less.&quot;<br /><br />*Taken from the group's debut EP release, Manifestum I.
