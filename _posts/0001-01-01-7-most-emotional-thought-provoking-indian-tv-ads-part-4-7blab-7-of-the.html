{% raw %}7 of the most emotional and thought provoking Indian TV ads . This is part six in the series of Emotional videos from 7BLAB.<br />These are mostly TV advertising videos, however, they double up for Pay per click advertising, which is the traditional mode adopted however it is going through a change over time. Programmatic advertising is taking over, which is the use of software to purchase digital advertising. A demand-side platform (DSP) is a system that allows buyers of digital advertising inventory to manage multiple ad exchange and data exchange accounts through one interface. This is the way ahead for these ads to avoid the media buying agency and traditional ad networks. The creative (advertising ideas) are varied, targeted mostly at the emotional senses and distributed through platforms like facebook ads, Instagram Ads, Yahoo ads, Vimeo Ads.<br /><br />Our Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/7blab">https://www.youtube.com/c/7blab</a>{% endraw %}
