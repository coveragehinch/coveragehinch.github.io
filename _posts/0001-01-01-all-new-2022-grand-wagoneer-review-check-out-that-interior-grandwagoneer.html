{% raw %}#GrandWagoneer<br />#JeepGrandWagoneer<br />#CoupleCarReview<br />This is a Motormouth couple car review of the all-new 2022 Grand Wagoneer. This new Grand Wagoneer comes with a 6.4L V8, an 8-speed automatic transmission with 471 horsepower and 455 lb-ft of torque. The Grand Wagoneer offers the most overall passenger volume in its class with a new level of premium comfort and best-in-class second and third row legroom. It also has a best-in-class towing capacity of 9,850 pounds. With its dramatic yet contemporary exterior design, the backend reminds me of its predecessors from decades ago. The unique LED projector headlights have an integrated electronic headlamp motor that turns the light left or right to illuminate the road ahead. The Grand Wagoneer base trim comes with 20” wheels, all other trims get 22” wheels. Our test model is the top trim Series III in Silver Zynith with a black and tan interior, it has 22” aluminum painted wheels for $1,995 CAD, 22” polished aluminum wheels are standard on this trim. Other standard features include, LED headlights and LED taillights, LED cornering fog lights, bodyside power side steps, deep tinted sunscreen glass, a gloss black painted roof, hands-free power liftgate and a three-panel sunroof. The Grand Wagoneer offers an elegant and sophisticated not to mention spacious and comfortable cabin. Our test model has a Palermo leather-trimmed black and tan interior with quilted accents, a 12.3” driver information display, Uconnect 5 with a 12” touchscreen and wireless Apple Carplay and Android Auto. The 10.25” climate control screen lets you control the front and rear cabin seats including, massage features. I like that Jeep left buttons for the heated and ventilated seats as well as, the heated steering wheel, you don’t have to go into the screen to change them. The wireless charger is hidden behind the screen neatly. With the touch of a button, it flips to reveal the wireless charging pad, a storage compartment and USB ports. The passenger interactive 10.25” display located above the glove compartment allows passengers to access the entertainment system and update GPS coordinates. Of course, one of the standout features in this Grand Wagoneer is the 23-speaker McIntosh Audi system, which is standard on the top two trims. The base trims get a 19-speaker MacIntosh system, however the 23-speaker system is available one up from the base model. Is it as good as the Escalade’s 36-speaker AKG system? Not quite, but definitely has an amazing sound to it. All trims come with 7-passenger seating but 8-passenger seating is available at no extra charge.The Grand Wagoneer has standard Quadra lift air suspension, Adaptive damping suspension, Quadra Drive II 4WD system, Electronic limited slip differential and a Selec-terrain traction management system with 5 modes. Night Vision with pedestrian and animal detection is standard on the top trim but available on all trims. If you are looking for a trim with a cooler vibe, the Obsidian model might be for you. It comes with a black onyx grille, gloss black exterior mirrors, body-colour fascia, 22” tinted machined cast aluminum wheels with gloss black inserts, a black instrument panel, black leather seats and piano black trim.<br />Fuel economy, the Grand Wagoneer gets 18.6L/100 km, 15 MPG city and <br />12.8L/100m highway, 22 MPG highway. <br /><br />Get the dealership cost, any rebates and special interest rates, plus secret discounts, go to CarCostCanada.
