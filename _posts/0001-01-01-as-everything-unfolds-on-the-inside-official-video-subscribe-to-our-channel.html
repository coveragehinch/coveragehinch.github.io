Oh god you made me feel like nothing again, nothing again<br /><br />The windows are caving in<br />Glass underneath my skin<br />See what you need<br />Made us out to be enemies, enemies<br />(While you wallow in your selfish worth)<br /><br />Take all of my time, take all your petty lies<br />Holding out for a day on the right side<br />Crawling out of bed, while I’m burning up on the inside<br /><br />Take me out of line, let my withered soul die<br />I know what you want and it’s burning me up<br />On the inside<br /><br />Is my mind lying to me? <br />Am I supposed to feel free?<br />Do I deserve, is this my worth?<br />To feel pity under your control<br /><br />Take all of my time, take all your petty lies<br />Holding out for a day on the right side<br />Crawling out of bed, while I’m burning up on the inside<br /><br />Take all of my time, take all your petty lies<br />Holding out for a day on the right side<br />Crawling out of bed, while I’m burning up on the inside<br /><br />Take me out of line, let my withered soul die<br />I know what you want and it’s burning me up<br />Take me out of line, let my withered soul die<br />I know what you want and I won’t let you have it<br /><br />#aseverythingunfolds #withineachliestheother #longbranchrecords #posthardcore #metalcore{% endraw %}
