There are, however, certain diseases that can’t be cured, and most of them are genetic in nature. And in today’s video, we will look at 10 people with different genetic disorders, and discovery their amazing, and sometimes tragic life.<br />From a man with otherworldly flexibility, to someone with a condition that goes right up the nose, here are 10 unusual people with the rarest genetic mutations.<br /><br />Number 10. Javier Botet<br />Remember that extremely bendy ghost from the movie Mama? That one scared the living daylights out of me. Believe it or not, that wasn’t all CGI, and there’s an actor that is behind all that, well, bendiness. And his name is Javier Botet.<br />Botet suffers from a not so rare but very unusual genetic disorder called Marfan syndrome, which affects about one in every 10,000 to 20,000 births. It’s basically a disease of the connective tissues which causes the bones to overgrow and create loose joints. Hence the reason for Botet’s bendiness.<br />People with Marfan Syndrome tend to have long and thin arms and legs. They can also have overgrown ribs can cause the chest bone to bend inward or push outward. And since they tend to have longer backbones, curvature of the spine is also a major problem. <br />Interestingly, people with Marfan syndrome will also have Myopia, which is not a bone disease at all, but rather nearsightedness.<br /><br />Number 9. Bree Walker<br />Bree Walker has pretty much lived a full life. She was a popular TV anchor in Los Angeles and she’s also an actress that has appeared in numerous TV and movie projects, most notably in the extremely edgy series Nip/Tuck. She done all that despite having been born with the genetic condition called ectrodactyly.<br />A person with ectrdactyly, or more commonly known as Lobster Hand Syndrome, has a cleft where the middle finger or toe should be, a condition that gives the hand or foot the appearance of a lobster's claw, but ectrodactyly patients can have any number of unusual arrangements of the digits. If you see a travelling circus that features a lobster boy, it’s more than likely that that person also has this condition.<br />And this condition hereditary. In fact, two of Bree’s children are also born with it. Just a few decades ago, people with lobster hand syndrome would have very little prospects in life aside from joining the circus freak show. However, modern medical procedures can now help sufferers lead a very normal life.<br /><br />Number 8. Curtis Thompson<br />Curtis Thompson, although born normal, grew up to be like no other child. At age six, he was prone to doing a variety of involuntary movements, often causing him to hurt himself. Doctors have even described him as an out of control machine that is out to destroy himself, and sadly, that’s not an overstatement. <br />Curtis’s story was published in D magazine back in 1977, and the fact is, we don’t even know if he’s still alive. One thing’s for certain though; and that he lived out his life strapped into a bed or wheelchair when his compulsion to self-destruct becomes too<br />dangerous to his physical safety.<br />Curtis suffers from Lesch–Nyhan Syndrome, a disease that forces the body to produce an excess amount of uric acid, which manifest s under the skin as gouty arthritis. It also affects a victim’s neurological behavior, who then exhibit involuntary body movements, like tensing muscles, jerking movements, and flailing limbs. Self-mutilating behaviors are also common, including head banging, and lip and finger biting.<br />And the worst thing about all of this is sufferers can feel every single iota of pain that they inflict upon themselves.<br /><br />Number 7. David Vetter<br />Remember Bubble Boy? That movie who featured Jake Gyllenhaal play a character that was born with no immune system and had to live his entire life inside a germ-free bubble? Well, there are actually real people like that and the disease is very real as well.<br />David Vetter is one of them. He was born with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disorder or SCID. It’s also called the Boy in the Bubble disease, because back in the day, someone born with this has to live inside a germ free bubble. It was thought that he would develop an immune system after he underwent a bone marrow transplant, but that failed as well. He spent his short life inside the bubble, eventually dying at age 13, after another failed bone marrow transplant.{% endraw %}
