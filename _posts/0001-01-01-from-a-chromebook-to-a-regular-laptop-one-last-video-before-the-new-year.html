{% raw %}One last video, before the new year comes a-calling! Let's take an Acer C720P Chromebook that Google forgot and start down the road of making it into something useful.<br /><br />Stuff to know, do and read: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mrchromebox.tech/">https://mrchromebox.tech/</a><br />Gallium OS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://galliumos.org/">https://galliumos.org/</a><br /><br />I have a lot of time for low power computers (although it could be said that you have to!)...they are much more interesting to me than fire breathing high performance systems. You are responsible for the results of your own actions.{% endraw %}
