{% raw %}This clip presents an overview in the integration of instructional media into the instructional design process. The main idea is to create or select media and materials and finally integrate them into the lesson. The lesson plan created should indicate how the media and materials will be used and the role played by both teachers/instructors/facilitators and students.{% endraw %}
