{% raw %}In this video we take a look at a set of battles in Season 9 of the Pokemon GO Battle League (GBL) in the Great League featuring Trevenant, Luxray and Dewgong.<br /><br />Want me to showcase your battles on the channel?<br />GO Battle League Submissions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forms.gle/whekpsdS8qrCq6mJ6">https://forms.gle/whekpsdS8qrCq6mJ6</a> <br /><br />In today's video we are taking a look at some battles in the 3400's testing out the newest Community Day exclusive Pokemon, Luxray! The team being featured in this video consists of a Trevenant lead with Luxray and Dewgong in the back. I would not recommend testing out new Pokemon in this ELO range if you are looking to climb, but that is what we are doing in this video.<br /><br />Luxray is a glassy Electric type Pokemon that gained access to the community day exclusive Psychic move Psychic Fangs. Psychic Fang is a Poison Fang clone with a 100% debuff to the opponents defense by 1 stage. This provides Luxray with a bait move to pair with the heavy hitting nuke move, Wild Charge. Unfortunately, Luxray is a bit too glassy for the Great League and it feels as if its potential is better realized in the Ultra or Master Leagues.<br /><br />In this video I have decided to run Spark as the Fast move as it seemed to win more match-ups that were important for me in this team comp. Snarl is also a solid move to run on Luxray, and in most situations is probably the ideal choice for the fast move.<br /><br />Joining Luxray on this team is Trevenant in the lead, another Pokemon I am using for the first time. Trevenant is a Ghost/Grass type that is extremely high ranked on PvPoke. Unfortunately, the meta appears to be dominated by a lot of Dark and Poison types currently, which means that Trevenant could run into some issues. It is a solid answer to Fighting types however, and provides additional Azumarill coverage while being the only real answer for opposing Galarian Stunfisk or Bastiodon on this team.<br /><br />Dewgong is the final Pokemon rounding out this team. I decided to go with Dewgong because I wanted an answer for Nidoqueen, as well as something that could deal with Sableye safe-swaps, something I was expecting a lot of. Luxray can only defeat Sableye by landing a Wild Charge, so it is a bit too risky of a response. Dewgong was also the Pokemon that carried me to the leader board during Kanto Cup, so I wanted to keep using it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very risky team that I would not recommend for climbing. Luxray is the definition of a spice pick and is not recommended for the Great League. It is extremely difficult to build around given it's weaknesses and the only way to really benefit from using it is with perfect alignment each time.<br /><br />In this video we use a team consisting of: Trevenant (Shadow Claw, Shadow Ball, Seed Bomb), Luxray (Spark, Wild Charge, Psychic Fangs*) &amp; Dewgong (Ice Shard*, Icy Wind*, Water Pulse).<br /><br />* denotes Legacy move (may require Elite TM).<br /><br />__________________________________________<br /><br />On this channel we cover PvP content mostly related to GO Battle League in Pokemon GO.
