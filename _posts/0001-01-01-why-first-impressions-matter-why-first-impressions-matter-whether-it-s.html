{% raw %}Why first impressions matter. Whether it’s a first date, a job interview, or just meeting a friend of a friend, first impressions are important. And depending on how much of a social butterfly you are, meeting someone for the first time can also be extremely nerve-wracking and stressful. But just how important are first impressions, really? After all, it’s not like you can glean everything there is to know about a person just from your first encounter, right? After all, people are complex and multifaceted. <br /><br />#FirstImpressions #Confidence #Psychology<br /><br />Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music">https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music</a><br /><br />Summary:<br />So what makes first impressions so important? While people are far too complex to be perfectly encapsulated in a single encounter, our brains may try to convince us otherwise. According to Psychology Today, human beings seem to be mentally hardwired to size each other up as quickly as possible. In fact, a person often makes up their mind about someone w ithin the first 7 seconds of meeting them! The reason for these snap judgments can stem from a number of different factors, but once they’ve been made, a first impression can be hard to move on from. Because of this, first impressions can be an important, and in some cases, your only opportunity to really “sell yourself” to the person you’re meeting, which can be especially crucial in situations such as job interviews where leaving someone with a good first impression can make or break your chances at employment. That being said, there are ways you can ensure a better first impression when meeting someone for the first time; you can start putting these strategies into effect once you gain a better understanding of what goes into a first impression to start with.<br /><br />One weird little quirk in human psychology that has a strong impact on first impressions is an occurrence referred to as the “halo effect”. The halo effect occurs when our initial judgment of a person ends up unconsciously overshadowing our perception of that person as a whole, fairly or otherwise. The term gets its name because, when meeting someone for the first time, a positive external quality of theirs may shine over that person like a halo, glowing brightly enough to blind us from new details or information about that person that we may learn as time goes on. This can obviously lead to some incredibly harmful effects, such as some people being subjected to unfair and biased treatment based on aspects they can’t control, while others might be put on pedestals when their strengths seemingly overshadow their flaws. However, there are ways in which people have tried to work around the halo effect in order to be more fair and unbiased in their judgments. For example, in an academic setting, professors may choose to grade papers anonymously, so that preconceived notions they might have about specific students doesn’t have an adverse effect on their grades. You can also shake the halo effect simply by getting to know someone over a long period of time, such as in a long-term relationship. Eventually, the initial judgments of the halo effect will fade away as you begin to experience a more nuanced and realistic view of that person as new traits and information come to light.<br /><br />Of course, while true substance can eventually overcome a suboptimal first impression, most people often don’t get the chance to make up for their initial mistakes. This means that if you want someone to have a high opinion of you from your first meeting onward, you should pay attention to the ways in which your behaviour might be received by others, such as tone, posture and body language. Additionally, now that you know this information, you should also be more mindful of the ways in which your own personal prejudices might hold sway over the way you view others on a first impression, and try to break yourself out of that knee-jerk, judgmental mindset and see people for who they really are beyond your first impressions.<br /><br />Of course, breaking the psychology of first impressions is easier said than done. According to psychologist Leslie Zebrowitz from Brandeis University, the things that make or break a first impression can be as simple and subtle as someone’s facial information; even just seeing a photo of someone for the first time can be enough to create an impression which colours the thoughts and opinions you have of the person in question. <br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Medical Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i">https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i</a>{% endraw %}
