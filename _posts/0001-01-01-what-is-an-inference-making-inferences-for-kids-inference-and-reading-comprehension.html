{% raw %}What is an Inference? Making an inference simply means to use what you already know to make a guess about something that you don’t know.  It is a very important reading comprehension skill and throughout this video we help your kids and students practice making inferences.  <br /><br />There are 4 main steps to making inferences that we cover in this video.  They are: <br />1. Read the text. <br />2. Look for clues or important facts and details.<br />3. Combine those details with things that you already know.<br />4. Make inferences about what you are reading.<br /><br />We hope this video is helpful as you teach your kids about inferences and reading comprehension overall.  If you are looking for more inferences resources?  We have 6 different inference lesson plans with more activities, worksheets, classroom teaching ideas and more (for grades 1-6).
