{% raw %}A lot has been said about the ongoing championship fight between Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen. Many feel that this is one of the best rivalries in some time. Alfa Romeo’s Kimi Raikkonen, however, thinks otherwise and he has now explained why as quoted by GP Fans<br /><br />Link to poll: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxyyEyQfP8wM2j0CknkPZUSAfxFJPL1YM1">https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxyyEyQfP8wM2j0CknkPZUSAfxFJPL1YM1</a><br />0:00 - Kimi Raikkonen Downplays Hamilton-Verstappen Rivalry<br />1:23 - Fast Feed<br /><br />I'm your host Dillon Shelley and first up on Formula World:<br /><br />Kimi Raikkonen Downplays Hamilton-Verstappen Rivalry<br /><br />Kimi began by speaking about the intensity of the Max-Lewis rivalry<br /><br />“[It is] less [intense], for sure, because I’m not involved. For me, it doesn’t matter. Whoever has the most points at the end of the last race [will win]”<br /><br />He further explained how emotions can run high in any championship fight that is close<br /><br />“Honestly, I think everyone that gets close is always going to be in a lot of tight battles and one will be upset one day and the next another day”<br /><br />He then gave his thoughts on the incident from Brazil that led to a lot of discussions<br /><br />&quot;They didn’t touch each other so there’s not much to say about it really. I don’t think there was anything crazy. I’ve seen a lot more worse things. I’ve been involved in worse things. As I said, a lot has been written on something that’s made much worse than it actually is”<br /><br />He summed up his words by suggesting that things have been exaggerated <br /><br />“I think a lot has been written about it and making a big story out of not so many things in my view, but that is I guess F1, or the media”<br /><br /><br />Fast Feed<br /><br />Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has revealed that “[they] sat down during the summer break and [they] realised that [they] would get a better Checo if [they] gave him more security” [Auto Motor und Sport]<br /><br />“The second half of the season proves us right because Checo has become much better”<br /><br />Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko, meanwhile feels that “Max is fast in every car. Give him something and he's already driving at full speed on the second lap”<br /><br />“However, it takes longer with [Sergio Perez] to adapt especially when the plan has to be changed on short notice”<br /><br />Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz pointed out that “the last few circuits are somewhat unknown. In Jeddah, we have no idea what we're going to find” [Motorsport]<br /><br />“It seems to be a very fast circuit and at tracks like that we've seen the field shake up a lot. So, it could be very exciting”<br /><br />“There are fewer chicanes and it has a faster character. That can also bring the whole midfield much closer together. So, it will be some very tough racing”<br /><br />Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas feels that “a fifth title together in a row would be something really special to be part of, would be better than four” [Motorsport Week]<br /><br />“That’s definitely a goal and it’s also a motivation for me to keep pushing”<br /><br />He also feels that future teammate Guanyu Zhou “obviously knows how to drive, and he is quite young. The potential for sure is there”<br /><br />Former F1 driver Felipe Massa has explained that “the Haas is the worst car in Formula 1. [Mick Schumacher] doesn't have the best teammate” [Speedweek]<br /><br />“If he had someone with more experience, he would compete much better. We have to wait until he has a better car and a better teammate”<br /><br />“The Schumacher name is a burden for Mick. It helps him get sponsors and he gets a lot of support from them. But people expect things he can never deliver. The pressure is extremely high”<br /><br /><br /><br />Has the media blown the Hamilton-Verstappen rivalry out of proportion?{% endraw %}
