{% raw %}INFJ-T vs INFJ-A - The World's Rarest Personality Type - So, you've been typed as an INFJ personality type, the rarest of the 16 personalities according to the MBTI test.. but now you're stuck wondering &quot;What's the difference between an INFJ-T vs INFJ-A?&quot;<br /><br />Well, although the key differences between the turbulent and assertive INFJ aren't so easy to point out, there are definitely a few INFJ characteristics that set these two INFJ subtypes apart. <br /><br />For example, when it comes to INFJ stress, the INFJ-T (turbulent INFJ) is known to be the more sensitive of the 2 INFJ types, easily expressing when they're stressed and overwhelmed. While the INFJ-A (Assertive INFJ) on the other hand seems less effected by external everyday stress and are more focused on the bigger picture. <br /><br />So what else sets these two INFJs apart.. Are you an INFJ-T personality type or an INFJ-A personality type?<br /><br />#INFJ-A #INFJ-T #MBTI <br /><br />RELATED VIDEOS:<br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ 9 INFJ Dating Struggles (The World's Rarest Personality Type)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ8JZH9Hzvk&amp;t=15s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ8JZH9Hzvk&amp;t=15s</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ 15 Signs You Have The Worldâ€™s Rarest Personality Type - INFJ<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl__XKHWJAY&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl__XKHWJAY&amp;t=1s</a><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ 9 Signs Youâ€™re a True Heyoka (The Most Powerful Empath)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn_pRRwS8_g&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn_pRRwS8_g&amp;t=1s</a><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />ðŸ’™  SUBSCRIBE to our YOUTUBE: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyVtcgxAQ_qWKLZLydv8hdg?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyVtcgxAQ_qWKLZLydv8hdg?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /> <br />ðŸ’™  FOLLOW us on INSTAGRAM: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/psych_o_official/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/psych_o_official/?hl=en</a><br /><br />ðŸ’™  FOLLOW us on FACEBOOK: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PSYCH.O.Psychology">https://www.facebook.com/PSYCH.O.Psychology</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />All Audio &amp; Video Production by PSYCH-O<br /><br />Disclaimer: PSYCH-O is a theory channel.
