{% raw %}A NARCISSIST will use PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY to cast doubt on his or her bad behaviors so that they get away with murder. Even when confronted with evidence, a narcissist will spin a story to cover a story without breaking a sweat. It’s amazing how they do it and it’s even more amazing how targets will fall for it. But this is how the narcissist gets a free pass for everything he or she does.<br /><br />Welcome to the &quot;When Love Is a Lie&quot; Audio Blog PODCAST where I talk about everything having to do with narcissism in relationships.
