{% raw %}Anathema<br />A Fine Day To Exit<br />2001<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Long way from home<br />Nowhere to go<br />What made the river so cold?<br /><br />The sweat of thoughts<br />Trickle down my brow<br />Soaking and stinging my eye<br /><br />You've got to face it head on<br />So you can turn this thing around<br />'cause this ain't right<br /><br />Telltale signs and cries<br />Of dreams unfulfilled<br />And time is running, running dry<br /><br />Panic stricken bloodshot hearts<br />Try to restart<br />But no longer build the well to survive sweet oblivion<br /><br />You've got to face it head on<br />So you can turn this thing around<br />'cause this ain't right<br /><br />I've got these feelings and I don't know why<br />I see all my fears in the darkness of light<br />What made the river so cold?<br /><br />Never anyone to rearrange and fall to<br />Time inside the empty<br />Call to the blameless, I am faithless<br />Placid dying eyes<br /><br />You've got to face it head on<br />So you can turn this thing around<br />'cause this ain't right<br /><br />You have to go eye to eye<br />Raise your face to the sky<br />'cause this ain't right<br /><br />I got to believe when I say<br />Only this is the way{% endraw %}
