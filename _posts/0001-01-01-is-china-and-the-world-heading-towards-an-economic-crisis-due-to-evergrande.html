{% raw %}Is China and the world heading towards an economic crisis due to Evergrande?<br />#chinasnewnormal<br />TIMESTAMPS<br />00:00 Evergrande video introduction <br />01:50 China's four biggest time bombs: debt, SOEs, Real-Estate, social unrest<br />04:42 Who founded evergrande?<br />05:50 Which business is Evergrande in?<br />07:45 What are the problems Evergande is facing? 300 Billion in debt they can't pay back; 80% loss in value; selling assets at discount.<br />09:53 Which systemic problems does China have? Land sale, property speculation, little write downs of bad investments, and crossing the red lines of real-estate liabilities<br />14:12 What could Evergrande create social unrest? Bankcruptcies, unemployment, deposit losses, wealth losses. <br />16:12 What is the solution for Evergrande? Sell off assets as they won't get a bail-out from Beijing, nationalisation of assets and even Evergrande's owner's wealth<br />19:20 Will Evergrande survive? Only if they sell off most of their assets, get confidence from market back, go through a government led restructuring and get help from Beijing to finish the unfinished properties.<br />22:09 Will Evergrande set-off a crisis in China or globally? Unlikely, as this is not Lehman brothers or Japan crisis of 90s, but also because Beijing has been preparing for this and is not bailing out Evergrande.<br /><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pascalcoppens.com/">https://www.pascalcoppens.com/</a><br /><br />ABOUT PASCAL COPPENS:<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pascalcoppens.com">http://www.pascalcoppens.com</a><br />Linkedin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pacovision/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/pacovision/</a><br />Youtube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/pascalcoppens">https://www.youtube.com/c/pascalcoppens</a><br /><br />BOOK - CHINA's NEW NORMAL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pascalcoppens.com/shop">http://www.pascalcoppens.com/shop</a>{% endraw %}
