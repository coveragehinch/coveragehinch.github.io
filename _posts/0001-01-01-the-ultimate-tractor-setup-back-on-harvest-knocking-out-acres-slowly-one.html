{% raw %}Back on Harvest knocking out acres… slowly. One of the farms started getting pretty slick on some steep slopes, so instead of tearing up the hills I decided to switch to another farm that was flat, but was going to have tillage done anyway. If I need to fix ruts that would be the field to harvest in as of now. I needed a ride back to the combine (hence the bike)… but someone forgot to check tire psi before loading it up!<br /><br />Also figured out that one field on the bottom farm seems to be half tilled and half not tilled. You can definitely tell where there’s tile. Insane difference in yield. I may try and get some tilling done this fall! <br /><br />Instagram- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thesquad_youtube/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/thesquad_youtube/?hl=en</a>{% endraw %}
