{% raw %}What is the my planet game? It is a game that will tell you a lot about yourself and show you how you think and act. In this video, I will explain to you how the 'my planet game' will help to get to know yourself better.<br /><br />Differences can make for painful incompatibilities. But differences can also make for healthy compatibilities that lead to all kinds of positive things. When we are suffering as a result of the differences between ourselves and other people, it is tempting to think that if everyone was just like us, there would be no problems in the world. For this reason, it is good to do awareness exercises so that you can clearly see your positives and negatives, strengths and weakness, what you possess and what you lack and also the danger of there being no counter energies to your own character traits, perspectives and values. One of the best exercises for this is a little game I like to play with people called the “My Planet” game. What’s great about this game is that even though it will challenge your ego, it is also really fun to do. <br /><br />Full Article here ⟶ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/myplanet/">https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/myplanet/</a><br /><br />Five FREE Guided Meditations by Teal to Support Your Journey:<br />╰ Get Instant Access: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tealswan.net/present">https://www.tealswan.net/present</a><br /><br />Get Support on your Journey with Teal's Spiritual Tools, Frequencies, Meditations and More:<br />╰ Official Shop click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tealswan.vip/Shop">https://tealswan.vip/Shop</a><br /><br />Dive Deeper and Access ALL of Teal's Exclusive Content, Daily Updates, Workshop Replays &amp; More:<br />╰ Premium Content click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tealswan.vip/Premium">https://tealswan.vip/Premium</a><br /><br />#lawofattraction #spirituality #awakening<br /> <br />If you are in a crisis or if you or any other person may be feeling suicidal or in danger, the following<br />resources can provide you with immediate help: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tealswan.vip/Help">https://tealswan.vip/Help</a><br /><br />Beginning Song:<br />Alchemy - Blake Dyer<br />www.sundyer.com<br /><br />Ending Song<br />Our Game - Yaima<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/35ZR6JY">https://spoti.fi/35ZR6JY</a><br /><br />Teal Swan is a personal transformation revolutionary.
