{% raw %}“It is what it is” is a common phrase getting tossed around right now. To a certain extent, it’s true. Yes, this is what we’ve been dealt. This is the reality of our situation right now. But have we just started accepting disappointment as the norm without questioning if God is at work?  <br /><br />The story of Abraham and Sarah is a good illustration of what to do with disappointment and unmet expectations when we are faced with it. Through Romans 4:18-21, Pastor Steven Furtick of Elevation Church shows us how to have unwavering faith in the midst of doubt and disappointment. Yes, it is is what it is... but it’s not what it seems. <br /><br />This sermon was originally recorded April 24, 2016.<br /><br />Click here to watch the latest sermons: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ele.vc/jeetED">http://ele.vc/jeetED</a><br /><br />To support this ministry and help us continue to reach people all around the world click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://elevationchurch.org/giving/">http://elevationchurch.org/giving/</a><br /><br />See what God can do through you.
