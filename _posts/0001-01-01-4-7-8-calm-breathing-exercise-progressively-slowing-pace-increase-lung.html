{% raw %}Reduce anxiety and increase lung capacity with the 4-7-8 breathing technique. Enjoy the calming effects as the progressively slowing pace gently extends your breaths over eight cycles.<br /><br />4-7-8 rhythmic breathing is a core part of many meditation and yoga practices as it promotes relaxation and can also be used to help you fall asleep in a shorter period of time. The goal is to calm your sympathetic nervous system, which controls the fight-or-flight response. <br /><br />If you tend to be a shallow breather, it’s common to feel a little lightheaded when you start taking deeper breaths. This sensation will pass as your body becomes accustomed to a greater flow of oxygen. You can always take a short break and resume the exercise once you feel normal. It is not necessary that your timing perfectly matches the video example. You can take shorter or longer breaths as long as you maintain the ratio - Inhale 4, Hold 7, Exhale 8. Also, try to keep your expectations realistic. <br /><br />Some days will go better than others but the more often you practice, the more effective the exercise becomes.<br /><br /><br /><br />//  STRUGGLING TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH?<br /><br />If you are having difficulty taking a deep enough breath to complete the 4-7-8 exercise, you may wish to begin with a simple video that teaches proper abdominal breathing.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ApAsKd4hYiw">https://youtu.be/ApAsKd4hYiw</a><br /><br /><br /><br />//  GUIDED HANDS-ON MEDITATIONS<br /><br />If you would like to try meditation, I encourage you to try the Hands-On Meditation technique.
