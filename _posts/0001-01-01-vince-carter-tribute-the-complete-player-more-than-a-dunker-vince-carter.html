{% raw %}Vince Carter is known worldwide as quite possibly the greatest dunker who ever played in the NBA. That honor is a double-edged sword however, as it has overshadowed his complete basketball game and supreme skillset as a player. Vince worked diligently to improve his ball handling, his post moves, his passing, and his perimeter game. And when he was in his prime, he was truly one of the best all around players. It's unfortunate that many NBA fans don't know this about him. You often see the quote &quot;Vince was just a dunker&quot; on social media. I made this video in the hopes it will open eyes and teach people how good he was in virtually all aspects of the game. If you ever encounter a friend or fellow fan who claims &quot;VC was just a dunker&quot;, please just link them this video :-)<br /><br />Top 20 All-Time Scorer<br /><br />Top 10 All-Time 3PT FGM<br /><br />8x All-Star<br /><br />1 of 4 players with at least 25,000 points and 2,000 3P FG.
