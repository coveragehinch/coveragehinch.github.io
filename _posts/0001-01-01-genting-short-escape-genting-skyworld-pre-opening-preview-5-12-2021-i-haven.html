{% raw %}I haven't felt the chilly, windy air and cloudy sky up on the mountain in a long time. Even though the renovations and upgrades are still happening, people have begun to flock to this location in anticipation and enjoyment. Throughout the COVID time, the majority of people continued to wear masks, adhere to SOP, and protect themselves while enjoying the experience. Regardless, this brand new GENTING HIGHLAND is on its way to meet us very soon.{% endraw %}
