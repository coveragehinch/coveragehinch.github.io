{% raw %}This episode serves as a sort of “Dopamine Masterclass”. I discuss the immensely powerful chemical that we all make in our brain and body: dopamine. I describe what it does and the neural circuits involved. I explain dopamine peaks and baselines, and the cell biology of dopamine depletion. I include 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression, and I explain why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. I explain how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons including caffeine from specific sources. I describe non-prescription supplements for increasing dopamine—both their benefits and risks—and synergy of pro-dopamine supplements with those that increase acetylcholine. <br /><br />#HubermanLab #Dopamine #Motivation<br /><br />Thank you to our sponsors:<br />ROKA - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.roka.com">https://www.roka.com</a> -- code &quot;huberman&quot;<br />InsideTracker - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman">https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman</a><br />Headspace - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer">https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer</a><br /><br />Logitech Event - Rethink Education: The Biology of Learning<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://info.logitech.com/ReThink-Education.html">https://info.logitech.com/ReThink-Education.html</a><br /><br />Support Research in Huberman Lab at Stanford:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving">https://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving</a><br /><br />Our Patreon page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman">https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman</a><br /><br />Supplements from Thorne:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman">http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman</a><br /><br />Social:<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab">https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hubermanlab">https://twitter.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab">https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com">https://hubermanlab.com</a><br />Newsletter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network">https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network</a><br /><br />Links:<br />Review on Dopamine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00455-7">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00455-7</a><br />Cold Exposure &amp; Dopamine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004210050065">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004210050065</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00:00 Introduction &amp; Tool 1 to Induce Lasting Dopamine<br />00:04:48 Sponsors: Roka, InsideTracker, Headspace<br />00:09:10 Upcoming (Zero-Cost) Neuroplasticity Seminar for Educators<br />00:09:58 What Dopamine (Really) Does<br />00:15:30 Two Main Neural Circuits for Dopamine <br />00:18:14 How Dopamine Is Released: Locally and Broadly<br />00:22:03 Fast and Slow Effects of Dopamine<br />00:25:03 Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate<br />00:28:00 Your Dopamine History Really Matters <br />00:30:30 Parkinson’s &amp; Drugs That Kill Dopamine Neurons.
