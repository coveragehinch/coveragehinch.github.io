I grew up as a kid watching my dad's recorded VHS tapes of playoff games through the 70s and 80s, and collected all the Basketball cards. Something about the game and what it represents just hooked me from a very young age.<br />My love for the game only continues to grow as time goes on. I love studying and analyzing the game, with an unbiased perspective. Feel free to subscribe, follow me on social media, and celebrate this amazing game and it's rich history with me!<br />I post videos every week on NBA history, predictions, hypothetical scenarios and current NBA topics.<br /><br />______<br /><br />Intro Music: Turn On - RW Smith <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EzIBvLO8V9s​​​​​​​​​​">https://youtu.be/EzIBvLO8V9s​​​​​​​​​​</a><br /><br />-----<br /><br />#BillRussell #Celtics #GOAT{% endraw %}
