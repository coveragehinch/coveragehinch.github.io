Fried Deviled Eggs<br /><br />You'll Need (for 6):<br /><br />- 3 hard-boiled eggs, peeled<br />- 2–3 tbsp cream cheese, softened<br />- 1 tsp paprika<br />- flour + whisked eggs + crushed cornflakes for the breading<br />- chopped chives to serve<br /><br />Here's How:<br /><br />Cut the hard-boiled eggs in half lengthwise and remove the egg yolks. To make the deviled egg filling, stir the egg yolks, softened cream cheese, and paprika together until the texture is smooth and fluffy. Transfer the deviled egg filling to a piping bag with a star-shaped nozzle and set aside for later. Heat a pot filled with cooking oil on the stove. To set up the breading station, crush 2 cups of corn flakes in a deep bowl, whisk 3 eggs in a separate bowl, and set out a third bowl filled with flour. Dredge each hard-boiled egg white in flour, whisked egg, and crushed corn flakes. Repeat the breading process as many times as necessary to completely coat each hard-boiled egg white. Fry the breaded egg whites in hot cooking oil. Pipe the deviled egg filling into the fried hard-boiled egg whites and garnish with chives.<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br /><br />2.

Preheat the oven to 325°F. Grate cheddar cheese over the baked potato halves, sprinkle chives on top, and season with salt and pepper. Add a pat of butter to each half and mix everything together with a fork. Create a shallow well in the middle of each half and carefully crack 1 egg into each well.
