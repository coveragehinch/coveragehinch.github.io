The equipment is a training tool for both professionals and amateurs to develop their technical, concentration skills, and stamina. The sport will bring real football to the home of the customers. Teqboard together with the Teqbox add-on, which is <br />expected to be released next year, is the worldâ€™s first equipment that can objectively measure the technical football skills of a player in a fun-filled way.  <br /><br />Teqball is the cleanest type of football. There is no physical contact between the players and according to the official rules of the sport, it is forbidden to touch the equipment. As a consequence, the risk of injury is very low.<br /><br />Teqball has been developed with a scientific approach after years of mathematical and physical calculations and empirical tests. All the elements of Teqball were designed in a way that the ball always bounces out to the players. This forces the players to handle and control the ball every 2-3 seconds. As a result, a very high number of touches can be reached by the players within a very short period of time.<br /><br />Teqball is not a competitor to football. Just the opposite, it is a supportive tool to enhance your skills and master air-to-air ball handling. It helps you play more confident and develop quicker decision making. It helps you to improve your decisive 'first touch' moves and eventually grow you into a more confident, spectacular, and skilled player.<br /><br />Teqball can be played by 2, 4 or more players.<br /><br />Teqball is not a game of luck. The better player wins.<br /><br />Teqball is simply genius!{% endraw %}
