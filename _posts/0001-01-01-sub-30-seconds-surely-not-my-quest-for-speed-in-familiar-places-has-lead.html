{% raw %}My quest for speed in familiar places has lead me here. Attempting to achieve the fastest time I possibly can in my hometown of Aldridge (127 locations) ..I start the video with the view to beat last weeks time of 50 seconds, but things soon escalate and I kick into determination mode. The question is, just how fast did I manage to go?{% endraw %}
