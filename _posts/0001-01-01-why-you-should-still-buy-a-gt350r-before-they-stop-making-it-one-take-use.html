Now that Ford has announced the end of this generation of GT350, we took the opportunity to take the last California press car for a proper blast! The 2021 Ford Mustang GT350R follows Porsche's GT3 playbook to a T, and offers not just one of the most rewarding experiences available in an American car, but one of the most rewarding experiences available in all cars. <br /><br />Ford provided the vehicle, insurance, and a tank of gas for this review. <br /><br /><br />Follow us!<br />T: @thesmokingtire @zackklapman <br />IG: @thesmokingtire @fakezackklapman <br /><br />Check out our PODCAST!
