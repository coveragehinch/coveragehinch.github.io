{% raw %}This video is sponsored by Osmo. The family is celebrating Maya's birthday today but the fun doesn't last long as these Junior Toy Spies have to get to work to help find their missing new toy! The Toy Master strikes again, and this time he takes the silly kids' new Osmo toys. With help from our pretend Toy Spy Lucy, Addy and Maya search for and discover the Toy Master's secret toy dungeon, full of tons of missing toys. Will the girls locate their collection of Osmo toys? You'll have to watch to find out!<br /><br />The Monster game is part of the Osmo play system that works with your iPad and Amazon Fire. Mo is an ADORABLE fuzzy orange character who will take your little ones on an interactive storybook adventure - from spooky forests to candy adventures, to a magic show to helping to decorate Mo's house and room! Your little one will draw on the creative board to help Mo through his adventures, and Mo the Monster will pull their exact drawing into the iPad - it's magic!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.playosmo.com/en/monster/">https://www.playosmo.com/en/monster/</a><br /><br />Music Credits:<br />Ice-cream Truck by New Wave Sounds<br />Guardians by Caleb Harris<br />Coming by OBOY<br />Alive and Free by Hawksilver<br />Creepers by Be Still the Earth<br />Acoustic Kinetic by Sounds Like Sander<br />Brenner by Falls<br />Escape by OBOY<br />Burst the Clouds by IDOLS<br />Making Way for Darkness by Hill<br />Feel Good Fresh by Hawksilver<br />String Thing by Hill<br />Two Lives by Alice in Winter<br />Give by OBOY<br />Witches Brew by Be Still the Earth<br />It's Time to have Some Fun by Yung Koolade<br />Star Light by Matt Wigton<br />Nazca by Isaac Joel{% endraw %}
