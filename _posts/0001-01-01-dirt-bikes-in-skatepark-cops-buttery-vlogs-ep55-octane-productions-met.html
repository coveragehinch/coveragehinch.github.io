{% raw %}Octane Productions met us out at Lake Elsinore motocross track and was able to get us some killer footage! We loaded up and hit the streets to find some rad urban hits. The skatepark was closed so we took our dirt bikes in for a little rip. Too bad the cops came right as we got there! Thanks to everyone who watches and supports us we truly appreciate it!
