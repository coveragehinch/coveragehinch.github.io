{% raw %}☆ Just a flower and a sword and you by my side ☆<br /><br /><br />I was bored and decided to watch a new show one night... so here we are, 12 episodes and 252 chapters of content later. TGCF is so good, I highly highly recommend it if you're looking for something to read!<br /><br />As for this cover, sorry the instrumental is so low quality - I had to change the pitch to fit my range, but I'm still happy with the end result. Please check out RERO's links in the credits if you like the mix! He worked fast and did an incredible job, so I recommend commissioning him if you ever need a mixer!<br /><br />----------------------------------------­­­­­­­----------------------------------------------------------<br />☆ Follow/Support Me ☆<br />----------------------------------------­­­­­­­----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />✦ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/azia">https://ko-fi.com/azia</a> (taking song requests!)<br />✦ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AziaCovers">https://twitter.com/AziaCovers</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------­­­­­­­----------------------------------------------------------<br />☆ Credits ☆<br />----------------------------------------­­­­­­­----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />✦ Lyrics/Vocals<br />      ✧ Azia<br /><br />✦ Mix<br />      ✧ RERO (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://rcduostudio.com/">http://rcduostudio.com/</a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RcCovers)">https://twitter.com/RcCovers)</a><br /><br />✦ Original song<br />      ✧ Written by Wang Xiaoqian &amp; Shen Mingli<br />      ✧ Composed &amp; Produced by Yang Bingyin<br />      ✧ Sung by Li Xinyi<br /><br />----------------------------------------­­­­­­­----------------------------------------------------------<br />☆ Lyrics ☆<br />----------------------------------------­­­­­­­----------------------------------------------------------  <br /><br />(feel free to use, but please credit me if you do)<br /><br />Xianle’s streets reflect an age of luxury<br />As a youth in white descends so gracefully<br />Wind-swept petals frame a face like precious jade<br />In a flash, one glimpse of his glory<br /><br />Deep within the night, green eyes gleam hungrily<br />Silver butterflies like stars are fluttering<br />In that moment, caught between two desolate roads<br />Moonlight reaches forth, and yet you brave the cold alone<br /><br />Flowering trees bloom with fragrance, over flashing swords<br />Reaching up to the heavens, as the thunder roars<br />Constellations will migrate, people will change<br />With a flower and a sword and one desire<br /><br />Taicang mountain hides remnants of long ago<br />Crumbled buildings, worn away by wind and snow<br />Faces gaunt with famine, scarred by war and by plague<br />In this land of mystery, a nameless ghost remains<br /><br />Now in this forest rain pours, washing flowers clean<br />Time does wonders like amber, in this mystic scene<br />Stifling fog and dark rain clouds cannot compare<br />To the flower and the sword held in one man’s hands<br /><br />Though I miss you so deeply, patiently I’ll wait<br />Let the world ridicule me, for light I still pray<br />Moving into a past of blossoming white<br />Just a flower and a sword and you by my side<br /><br />Whether earth or heavens<br />my place is by your side{% endraw %}
