{% raw %}Icy roads led to a huge pileup this morning on Cedar Ave. at I-35E in Eagan around 7:30 a.m. While Eagan emergency crews were on the scene of a crash in the southbound lanes, a three-car crash occurred in the northbound lanes. Several other drivers that were unable to stop either crashed or slid into the pile of cars, resulting in two people being struck by a car, one of which was a firefighter. Both appeared to have suffered non-life-threatening injuries, according to radio traffic. A total of 11 cars were involved according to footage from MnDOT traffic cameras. Crews remained on the scene and shut down Cedar Ave. as they cleared vehicles and debris from the roadway.<br /><br />For more original reporting, visit our website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.MNCRIME.com">http://www.MNCRIME.com</a><br />or Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CRIMEMN">https://www.facebook.com/CRIMEMN</a>{% endraw %}
