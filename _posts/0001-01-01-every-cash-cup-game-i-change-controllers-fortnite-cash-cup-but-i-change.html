I started this channel alongside my bro, Josh but he has a fulltime job keeping him busy. Keeping the name RodeyBros despite the channel being run solely by me because I think it's a dope name lol I like to think all of you are apart of the bros anyways, so let's keep growin this thing.<br /> - Cole<br /><br />#FortniteSeason7 #RodeyBros{% endraw %}
