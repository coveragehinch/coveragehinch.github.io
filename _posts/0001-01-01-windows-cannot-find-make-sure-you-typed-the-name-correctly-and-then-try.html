{% raw %}windows cannot find make sure you typed the name correctly and then try again.<br /><br />Either way, go to the following path in your registry, look for the executable filename of the program you're trying to open and look for a &quot;Debugger&quot; key. Check if the value says AVAST in it. If it does, just open the Debugger key, remove the value and save it again. Try to open your program again.<br /><br />comments :Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage – DisableDevelopmentMode -Register &quot;$($_.InstallLocation)AppXManifest.xml&quot;}<br /><br />#Windows<br />#Cannot<br />#Find<br />#MakeSure<br />#NameCorrectly<br />Copyright Disclaimer :<br />  Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.
