{% raw %}What is the effect of a guaranty?  | Sheryl Hunter | Hunter Business Law | We help your business | Request Consultation | 813-867-2640 | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.hunterbusinesslaw.com/">http://www.hunterbusinesslaw.com/</a> | info@hunterbusinesslaw.com | 119 S Dakota Ave , Tampa, FL 33606<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Guaranty usually comes up in the context of a business taking out a loan. The business maybe doesn't have enough collateral to give the lender comfort that if the loan is in default that there's enough asset to the business for them to recover the amount of the loan. What the lender will do is ask for a personal guaranty. They will say to the business owner, or a family member of the business owner who's willing to be a personal guarantor, you have to sign as a guaranty on this debt. If the business doesn't have the money to pay off the debt and they're in default, we're going to come after you as the guaranty on that debt. You've got to think real hard about whether you want to sign as a personal guarantor on debt because it can come back to haunt you, but sometimes it's the only way to get a loan.{% endraw %}
