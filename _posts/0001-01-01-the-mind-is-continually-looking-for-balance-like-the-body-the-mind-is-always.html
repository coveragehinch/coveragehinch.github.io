{% raw %}Like the body, the mind is always looking for balance. When we grasp at our thoughts it can push us further out of balance but when we focus with awareness we centre ourselves within our mind and begin to observes ourselves and the world around us from our mental centre.<br /><br />It's Important to recognise that the mind inherently wants to centre and work from a place of balance and equilibrium rather than thinking that our own mind is somehow working against us. Sometimes our thoughts can be hurtful as they search for a place of peace. Their true intention is to unify.<br /><br /><br />We have classes and courses to suit everybody's development, from the yoga you know to the yoga you have yet to discover, dive into our channel to explore your world of yoga.
