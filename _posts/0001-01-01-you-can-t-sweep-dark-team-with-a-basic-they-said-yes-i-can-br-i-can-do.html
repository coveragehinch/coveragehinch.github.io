{% raw %}Yes I can<br />I can do anything<br /><br />Yep, this is GT JP, not in the Global version, because my Lahn on global is only 5* with lvl 60 weapon lol, and that still count as a sweep, even tho my Tinia helped a bit on the Lupina part, but it's still count<br /><br />Also, keyword soup because I'm lazy<br />This game is Guardian tales, specifically Guardian tales JP, or known as ガーディアン-テイルズ, in this video, I'm gonna fight Lupina, Arabelle, and Oghma (ルピナ, アラベラ, そしてオグマ) and win with my Lahn (ラーン) in arena Master rank<br /><br />Also, giveaway winner gonna be announced via Community post{% endraw %}
