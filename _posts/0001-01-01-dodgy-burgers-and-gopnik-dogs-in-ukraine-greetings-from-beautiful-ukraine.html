{% raw %}ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Greetings from beautiful Ukraine. Myself and my bodyguard Johhny FD left the capitol city Kyiv on a provincial adventure to the town of Pereyaslav in search of a Soviet Cosmic church I had tried and failed to visit last winter. On the way we learnt some more about this great country, for example: to always avoid Burger City, how not to serenade babushkas and that even dogs have bad reputations and are banned from shopping at some places. Join us on a trip to what might actually be Ukraine's friendliest little town, Pereyaslav.<br /><br />The first video about Pereyaslav from the winter can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETHMzJmgz1k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETHMzJmgz1k</a><br /><br />Johhny FD channel is here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JohnnyJ3N">https://www.youtube.com/user/JohnnyJ3N</a>{% endraw %}
