{% raw %}Jennifer Lopez’s  AMAs Performance►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6VzkeGcsEyk">https://youtu.be/6VzkeGcsEyk</a> <br />More Celebrity News ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews">http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews</a><br /><br />JLo danced through an amazing musical montage for her opening number but Anaconda started playing, Nicki didn’t look too happy about it. So, was she throwin’ shade or nah?<br />All signs point to no. Before the night was over, a short clip of Nicki’s reaction to JLo’s dance started making rounds on Twitter and before things got out of hand, Nicki quoted that very tweet that said QUOTE, ‘Damn J Lo… Nicki Minaj facial expression says it all… We still love you doe’ and responded with ‘lol says what all? I’m looking at my own face on the screen when I’m looking to the right. I turn Bak &amp; look @ her’ with a laughing emoji. <br />To be fair, Nicki kind of had the same facial expression whenever the camera panned over to her during other performances, so if you’re going to say she’s throwing shade at JLo, you might as well say she threw shade at everyone at the AMAs, right?<br />As always, I want to hear from you!
