{% raw %}Increase the efficiency of your terminal<br /><br />Lödige Industries is revolutionising the response to current challenges in air cargo handling with the introduction of intelligent automated guided vehicles (AGV) for flexible and scalable ULD transportation.<br /><br />As integral element of fully automated cargo terminals, our new AGVs provide the link between import/export areas and build &amp; break workzones as well as automated storage and retrieval systems. In manual terminals, they can enable cargo handlers to take the first step towards the benefits of automation. Quickly and easily route transportation inside your terminal. Assign routes via your warehouse management system (WMS) and reduce stationary equipment to create flexible, scalable and reliable cargo flows.<br /><br />The data-based intelligence of our AGVs enables absolute accuracy and complete control over cargo flows. Reduce the potential for ULD damage, enable 24/7 operations and free workforce for higher value tasks.{% endraw %}
