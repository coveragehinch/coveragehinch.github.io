{% raw %}Debut audit - usual reflexive request for ID - they failed. Brief back and forth about public/private but on the whole a civil interaction, despite their show me your papers mentality.<br />Missed the opportunity to dismiss the Officers, my bad, lesson learned.<br />This is England 2021 - show me your papers!{% endraw %}
