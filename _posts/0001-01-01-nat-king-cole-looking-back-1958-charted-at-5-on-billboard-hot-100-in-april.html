{% raw %}Charted at #5 on Billboard Hot 100 in April 1958 and #2 on R&amp;B chart. One of my favorite Nat King Cole records. I always thought it sounded like a Brook Benton number and now I find out that Brook co-wrote it. Original Billboard review: &quot;First-rate performance by Cole on &quot;Looking Back&quot;, a rockaballad, makes the side a strong contender for Pop and R&amp;B. The song has a spiritual flavor and Cole presents it in a warm, sincere style.&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br />This record was re-released after Nat passed away and also bubbled under the Billboard Hot 100 at #123 in December 1965 (#27 Adult Contemporary).<br /><br /><br /><br />Written by Brook Benton, Belford Hendricks and Clyde Otis. <br /><br /><br /><br />B-side (of the 1958 single) is &quot;Do I Like It&quot; which charted at #67 on the Hot 100.{% endraw %}
