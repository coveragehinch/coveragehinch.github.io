{% raw %}Shadowverse gameplay showing Machina Shadowcraft which is probably the better deck Shadow has after Ceres nerf. <br /><br />It's almost like the old list of Machina Shadow from a couple expansions ago but now with the addition of Skeleton Rider for that surprise damage that really depends on your enemy board.
