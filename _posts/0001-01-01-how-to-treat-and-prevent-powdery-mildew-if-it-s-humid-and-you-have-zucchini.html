{% raw %}If it's humid and you have zucchini, cucumbers, pumpkins, or melons, chances are good you will have to deal with powdery mildew.  My preferred treatment is to remove affected leaves and apply a basic organic spray.<br /><br />My recipe is 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon pure neem oil, and 1/2 teaspoon dish soap.  (test any sprays before applying to your plants and never apply spray before a hot day.)<br /><br />To prevent the issue from arising, keep leaves on the plant dry, water in the morning so dew doesn't accumulate as much at night, and promote good airflow through pruning or by spacing plants out.{% endraw %}
