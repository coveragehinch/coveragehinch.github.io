{% raw %}Let's talk about how to leverage money for time.<br /><br />Want to learn how to grow or start your company and earn 10X more? Hop on in at ➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://email10k.com/now">https://email10k.com/now</a> ⬅️<br /><br />Grab the Cold Email Optimization Checklist for free here: ➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://email10k.com/checklist">https://email10k.com/checklist</a> ⬅️<br /><br />I have this realization all the time, which is just based on our pure revenue, if our entire team was let go, and it was just me and my co-founder Robert, we'd be making $50,000, $60,000 a month easy each. If it was just me solo, I'd be making over $120,000 or ish, something like that a month, right, if we cut everybody on the team. But instead of firing everybody, right, and moving on, we have decided, or I've decided to use my money to buy time. I would rather be able to block out two or three days a week to work and spend the rest of the time doing whatever I want then I would make a 100K a month. Plus, of course, the business wouldn't be where it is without the team, especially Robert, and actually we have almost no dead weight, no dead weight on the team.<br />So the businesses would not be where they are without the entire team. So who knows, maybe without the team, I would only be making 30K a month or 40K a month in pure profit, but I would rather not work so much and instead provide jobs and provide this whole system for everybody else. That's what me and Robert agree on more than anything. I think one reason why we really worked together as co-founders is we're so aligned on this. We would rather spend our money to buy time than spend our time to make more money. That's what I want to talk about in today's video. How can you use your money to buy back some of your time, so you're not working every second of the day?
