{% raw %}Messages de Fr Joseph Coleman sur YouTube : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ephesiens.org/JosephColeman-index.htm">http://ephesiens.org/JosephColeman-index.htm</a><br /><br />Listen carefully to this unique testimony of Brother Billy Paul Branham who was called by God to accompany God's Prophet to the point he had an encounter with the Angel of the Lord. <br />Since then Bro Billy Paul is able to discern the Presence of the Angel when he comes down. Notice the clear and firm identification with a group of people who knows He is alive, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever.<br /><br />This testimony was recorded in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2000{% endraw %}
