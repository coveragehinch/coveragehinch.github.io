{% raw %}The fate of Iraq hung in the balance of this final battle. If the insurgents won it would wipe out all the gains from the US Forces Surge. This was the final major combat operations in the Iraq War. The Siege of Sadr City in 2008 was two months of fierce close quarters combat. Baghdad was under attack from constant rocket and mortar fire. Something had to be done. <br /><br />The past few years of war were at stake here. Commander Hort of the 3rd Infantry Division came up with an clever plan to defeat the insurgency. He erected a 3 mile long span of 3 meter high t-walls to shut off the city. The enemy had their AK47's Rocket Propelled Grenades and Improvised Devices. The United States had their M2 Bradley Infantry fighting Vehicle and M1 Abrahams Main Battle Tank. <br /><br />Follow me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cappyarmy/">https://www.instagram.com/cappyarmy/</a><br /><br />This concrete T-wall prevented the insurgents from operating with any level of freedom. This final Iraqi War battle meant that the Iraqi Prime Minister was able to keep control of the country. It resulted in a drastically lower level of violence throughout Iraq and Baghdad. The &quot;Green Zone&quot; was safe from rocket attacks following this battle. <br /><br />Task &amp; Purpose is a military news and culture oriented channel.
