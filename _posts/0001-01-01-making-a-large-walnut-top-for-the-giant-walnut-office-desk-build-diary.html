{% raw %}In this episode of Welcome to the Woodshop, we go behind the scenes as Chris Salomone and Shaun Boyd start choosing the grain orientation, by matching the figuring and sapwood of the Walnut boards. This can make or break the look of the top. The guys then Domino and begin the glue-up process to make the large desk top.<br /><br />▸ Subscribe | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmAc4goFlpEG_YXgZv2MiGw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmAc4goFlpEG_YXgZv2MiGw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />▸ Music by Sleepy Pablo | <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sleepypablo.bandcamp.com/">https://sleepypablo.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><br />Welcome to the Woodshop! Come hang out with Chris Salomone, Shaun Boyd, Johnson and Dolores in this behind the scenes look at the Foureyes Furniture woodshop. <br /><br />In this episode of WTTW (Welcome to the Woodshop), Chris Salomone and Shaun Boyd make the large / giant / big top out of Walnut for the Giant Office L-Shaped Desk. They run into a little problem at the beginning as they cut too much of the expensive Walnut boards. They then choose the pattern / orientation by matching as closely as possible the figuring / color / grain / sapwood and heartwood to each other to obtain a consistent look. Then they cut biscuit / domino’s into the boards using a Festool Domino, and then glue-up and clamp the boards together.{% endraw %}
