{% raw %}If you’re in a crazy rush or want to be efficient, can you get in a ridiculously quick workout with weights, and build the same amount of muscle as someone who’s taking their time? Can you build MORE muscle with a fast workout than someone training normally? Yes! I’m going to show you how you can build muscle fast at the gym with 4 unique training methods. I’m also going to show you HOW, with 3 of the 4 muscle building techniques (e.g. rest pause method), “rushing” through your workout might even help you build more muscle.<br /><br />Method 1 of the muscle building techniques-  the 3/7 method. 1 round of the 3/7 method seems to be the equivalent to 4 sets of traditional training. Normally do 4 sets or less in an exercise? You can substitute that for 1 round of the 3/7 method. Let’s say with bench press you typically do 3 sets of 135 lbs for 10 reps. With the 3/7 method, using that weight, you would perform 3 reps, rest for 15 seconds, perform 4 reps, rest for 15 seconds, perform 5 reps, rest for 15 seconds, perform 6 reps, rest for 15 seconds, and then finally perform 7 reps. Excluding a proper warm up, if you perform each rep with a controlled 2 second eccentric and 1 second concentric, and take exactly 2 minutes rest between each set and exercise, you could expect this workout to take just under 45 minutes.<br /><br />Example workout:<br /><br />Bench Press 3 sets of 10 reps<br />Shoulder Press 3 sets of 10 reps<br />Triceps Push Down 3 sets of 10 reps<br />Barbell Row 3 sets of 10 reps<br />Lat Pulldown 3 sets of 10 reps<br />Biceps Curl 3 sets of 10 reps<br /><br />With 1 round of the 3/7 method applied to each of these exercises, you’ll reduce the workout to just under 24 minutes!<br /><br />Method 2 - rest-pause sets. With the rest pause method, let's say that your goal was to perform 3x10 bicep. What you could do instead is set a goal of 30 reps total ideally using the same weight. Do as many reps as you can on your first set. Then, instead of resting 1-2 minutes, rest for only 20-30 seconds and go again trying to do as many reps as possible. You simply repeat this process until all 30 repetitions are completed. Applying rest pause sets to every exercise in the sample workout can reduce the time taken down to 19 minutes!<br /><br />Method 3 for a quick workout with weights - drop sets. With drop sets, you’d perform the first set the exact same way as you normally would. But after completing it, instead of resting, you decrease the weight by 10-20% and perform another set very close or all the way to failure. After that set, you decrease the weight again by 10-20% and do this once again. You repeat this process for a minimum of the number of sets that you would normally do. While still performing the same exercises you could take a workout that originally took 45 minutes and reduce it to around 19 minutes!<br /><br />The last method that’ll help you build muscle fast at the gym - supersets. Supersets training opposing muscle groups, such as chest and back, is the way to go.  Now, it does take a little bit of time to switch exercises, but for the best results research indicates you want to do this as fast as possible, in at least under 30 seconds. If you apply supersets to the example workout shown earlier by using opposing muscle groups and movement patterns like, then while still performing the same exercises, sets, and reps, you can cut your workout duration down to just over half at 25 minutes.<br /><br />Play around with these 4 methods and see how you like them. Just be wary of their inclusion on big compound exercises where form breakdown can pose risks especially when you’re training to failure. But overall hopefully you were able to see that if you’re in a rush or just want to maximize your efficiency, then there are still many options available that’ll help you build muscle even with a fast workout. Just keep in mind that in order for these methods and your overall training to be effective, you need to pay attention to the little details as that’s what makes all the difference. <br /><br />Want to maximize your gains with our science-based programs?
