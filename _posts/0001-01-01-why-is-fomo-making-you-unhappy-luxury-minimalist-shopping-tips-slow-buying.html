{% raw %}Hi guys, I'm Eileen. This video is all about the fear of missing out (FOMO), especially in the context of shopping and consumerism. Before embracing luxury minimalism, FOMO made me buy a lot of things, including some very expensive designer pieces. Some of you might have watched the videos about some of my failed luxury purchases (Cartier, many Chanel bags, Louis Vuitton SLGs, and the list goes on). I was sadly, anything but intentional about my spending. There were many reasons for my shopping behaviours, but one of them was certainly because of my FOMO. I wanted to become like those bloggers who do massive luxury hauls and designer unboxings. I thought that was the definition of a happy life. Lucky for me, minimalism has completely changed my life for the better. I still enjoy beautiful and quality pieces, but I now practise slow buying and intentional living. With a bit of intentionality, a small curated wardrobe can serve us well, so there's no reason to constantly buy more. Let's all make the low-buy -challenge a routine instead xx<br /><br />DOWNLOAD PAUSE (a bit of mindfulness can change your life)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3l4KVOw">https://bit.ly/3l4KVOw</a><br /><br /><br /><br />OTHER VIDEOS YOU MIGHT LIKE<br />Should We Buy Louis Vuitton? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/sHZcZtvkpuo">https://youtu.be/sHZcZtvkpuo</a><br /><br />Why I Stopped Shopping At Chanel.   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZgZOQz-kKoc">https://youtu.be/ZgZOQz-kKoc</a><br /><br />Luxury Minimalism Changed My Life <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/N3lT7p2M1MQ">https://youtu.be/N3lT7p2M1MQ</a><br /><br />20 Things I Stopped Buying <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cKdNWvzwB70">https://youtu.be/cKdNWvzwB70</a><br /><br /><br /><br />WHAT I WORE IN VIDEO<br />Cashmere top (size 2)<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2XRVXgS">https://bit.ly/2XRVXgS</a><br /><br />Pearl earrings <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/39RETul">https://bit.ly/39RETul</a><br />(these are so chic <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2P6FMIc)">https://bit.ly/2P6FMIc)</a><br /><br />VCA necklace   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3gUcExh">https://bit.ly/3gUcExh</a><br />(so cute <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/37Gwol2)">https://bit.ly/37Gwol2)</a><br /><br />Watch <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2pUxlTy">https://bit.ly/2pUxlTy</a><br />similar <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/30rOKUb">https://bit.ly/30rOKUb</a><br />classy and simple <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3bC3544">https://bit.ly/3bC3544</a><br />what I'll love to buy preloved <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2NXZDIP">https://bit.ly/2NXZDIP</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />SHOP SMARTER<br /><br />I always make my online purchases through Quidco cash back website.
