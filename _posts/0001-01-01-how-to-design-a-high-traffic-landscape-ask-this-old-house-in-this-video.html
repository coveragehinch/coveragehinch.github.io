Mark out the location of the new garden bed area with some spray paint.<br />2. Strip out the existing grass using a sod cutter.<br />3. Rake out the soil underneath with a metal rake to ensure a smooth, tilled surface. a. Any time you dig, you have to call your state’s 811. They will check for gas, electrical, and any other local utility lines.<br />4. Pick out materials that fit the environment. Jenn and the homeowner picked out some New England fieldstone steppers for a walking path and some small boulders to decorate the space.<br />5. Pick out the plants. When thinking of a high traffic area, remember to look for plants with resiliency. They will need to survive foot traffic, dog urine, and winter and/or extreme heat. When landscaping a corner street, nothing so tall that it blocks visual of oncoming traffic should be used.<br />6. First lay out your stepping stones and boulders. These items are heavy so Jenn likes to do this task first to ensure no damage is done to the plants.<br />7. Stage your plants.<br />8. For each plant, dig a hole twice as wide and just as deep as the pot of the plant.<br />9. Remove the plant from the pot. Sometimes gently squeezing the pot will help remove the plant while keeping the root ball intact.<br />10. Tease the root ball of the plant gently with your fingers to loosen them up.<br />11. Place the plant in the hole and add starter fertilizer.<br />12. Backfill the hole with soil. Leave a bit of space ontop to make room for the mulch.<br />13. Once everything is planted, cover with mulch.<br />14. Water the plants.<br /><br />Where to find it?<br />Jenn selected plants and materials that could withstand a high level of foot traffic from pedestrians and dogs, as well as snow plows in the winter.<br /><br />For the walking path, she chose New England fieldstone steppers [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2YtRYrv],">https://bit.ly/2YtRYrv],</a> which can be found at most stoneyards and landscape supply stores in the Northeast. The plants she selected included Panicle hydrangea [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thd.co/3msdxRf],">https://thd.co/3msdxRf],</a> thyme [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thd.co/3lgIQ1Q],">https://thd.co/3lgIQ1Q],</a> shasta daisies [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thd.co/3AfLc5t],">https://thd.co/3AfLc5t],</a> butterfly bush [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thd.co/3Bjw48C],">https://thd.co/3Bjw48C],</a> geranium Rozanne [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thd.co/3aerxZ8],">https://thd.co/3aerxZ8],</a> boxwoods [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thd.co/3BjKeGO],">https://thd.co/3BjKeGO],</a> and hens and chicks [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thd.co/2YvFlfx],">https://thd.co/2YvFlfx],</a> which can all be found at home centers and nurseries.<br /><br />Expert assistance with this segment was provided by Forever Green Landscaping, Inc.
