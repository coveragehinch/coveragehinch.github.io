{% raw %}Director Peter Jackson examines the mindset of The Beatles as they prepared for a rooftop concert profiled in the new Disney+ documentary, &quot;The Beatles: Get Back,&quot; and sheds light on why the band suppressed the footage for decades. Jackson also mentions a chat between George Harrison and John Lennon that might have changed the direction of the band had they ever shared the details with Paul. Stick around for two more parts of this fascinating conversation with Stephen Colbert's friend and favorite director. #Colbert #TheBeatles #PeterJackson<br /><br />Subscribe To &quot;The Late Show&quot; Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/ColbertYouTube">http://bit.ly/ColbertYouTube</a><br /><br />Watch full episodes of &quot;The Late Show&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Puei40">http://bit.ly/1Puei40</a><br />Listen to &quot;The Late Show Pod Show&quot; podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.chtbl.com/Awagtx95?sid=yt">https://link.chtbl.com/Awagtx95?sid=yt</a><br />Like &quot;The Late Show&quot; on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://on.fb.me/1df139Y">http://on.fb.me/1df139Y</a><br />Follow &quot;The Late Show&quot; on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1dMzZzG">http://bit.ly/1dMzZzG</a><br />Follow &quot;The Late Show&quot; on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/29wfREj">http://bit.ly/29wfREj</a><br /><br />Watch The Late Show with Stephen Colbert weeknights at 11:35 PM ET/10:35 PM CT.
