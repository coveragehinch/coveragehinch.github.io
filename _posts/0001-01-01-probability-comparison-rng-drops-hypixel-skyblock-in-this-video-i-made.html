{% raw %}In this video I made a massive overview of what I think are some of the most relevant and interesting RNG drops in hypixl skyblock. But just because a item might have a seemingly low drop rate, doesnt mean its that easy. I didnt account for actually obtaining the means to spawn the mob itself.<br /><br />My source was the Bestiary and the Wiki, as those are more likely to be true than some random forum post. Some of these might be incorrect, but these are the odds according to the Wiki and Bestiary<br /><br />Find the Excel sheet containing a better overview here in my discord server:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/9ey3Uzvg">https://discord.gg/9ey3Uzvg</a><br /><br />Source:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hypixel-skyblock.fandom.com/wiki/Bestiary">https://hypixel-skyblock.fandom.com/wiki/Bestiary</a>{% endraw %}
