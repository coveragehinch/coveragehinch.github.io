{% raw %}Antihypertensives are a class of drugs that are used to treat hypertension. Antihypertensive therapy seeks to prevent the complications of high blood pressure such as heart attack and stroke. This pharmacology lecture covers topics such as pathophysiology of hypertension, regulation of blood pressure, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, baroreceptors, alpha &amp; beta receptors, vasoconstriction, vasodilation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, bradykinin, nitric oxide. Mechanism of action of antihypertensive drugs and their side effects; adrenergic antagonists; alpha &amp; beta blockers, centrally acting adrenergic agents, dihydropyridine &amp; nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, loop, thiazide, potassium-sparing diuretics, renin inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs), endothelin receptor antagonist, dopamine-1 receptor agonist, peripheral vasodilators. Drugs mentioned include; Doxazosin, Prazosin, Clonidine, Methyldopa, Amlodipine, Felodipine, Nicardipine, Nifedipine, Diltiazem, Verapamil, Furosemide, Hydrochlorothiazide, Triamterene, Spironolactone, Aliskiren, Benazepril, Captopril, Enalapril, Lisinopril, Quinapril, Ramipril, Candesartan, Irbesartan, Losartan, Olmesartan, Valsartan, Bosentan, Fenoldopam, Sodium Nitroprusside, Nitroglycerin, Hydralazine, and Minoxidil.<br /><br />Thanks for watching and don't forget to SUBSCRIBE, hit the LIKE buttonüëç and click the BELL buttonüîî for future notifications!!! <br /><br />Like what we do?
