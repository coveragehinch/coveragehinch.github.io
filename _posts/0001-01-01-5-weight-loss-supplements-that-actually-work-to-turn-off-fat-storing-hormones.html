{% raw %}These 5 weight loss supplements actually work to help burn fat and build muscle mass. Use these supplements for weight loss. <br /><br />Want to lose weight the natural way with supplements? If so, then you will want to check out these weight loss supplements. These supplements have scientific studies backing them and I have personally used them on many patients with great success. <br /><br />The key to losing weight with supplements is using the right TYPE and DOSE. This means you do NOT want to run to the grocery store to pick up these supplements as they will be low quality and in the wrong doses. <br /><br />Here are my lists of weight loss supplements that work: <br /><br />#1. Fish oil. <br /><br />Fish oil makes the list because it has been shown in studies to help you both BURN fat and BUILD muscle mass. In order to get this beneficial effect, you MUST use at least 2-3 grams per day. <br /><br />You can also use certain types of more potent fish oils which do not require these high doses. Fish oil also helps reduce inflammation. <br /><br />Here is my recommended fish oil brand: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.restartmed.com/product/omega-soothe-sr/">https://www.restartmed.com/product/omega-soothe-sr/</a><br /><br />#2. Berberine. <br /><br />Berberine is a plant alkaloid that helps target insulin resistance and high blood sugar. Insulin accounts for weight gain in a HUGE percentage of people (up to 50%). <br /><br />You'll want to use 1,000 to 1,500 mg of Berberine per day. <br /><br />Here is my recommended berberine supplement: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2qDC8Jr">https://amzn.to/2qDC8Jr</a><br /><br />#3. Probiotics. <br /><br />Probiotics are an undercover weight loss supplement that helps promote satiety AND help reduce sugar cravings. They also impact how many calories you absorb from your food and have an impact on certain hormones. <br /><br />For weight loss, you will want to use at LEAST 300 billion CFU per serving. Most standard probiotics only have around 15 to 20 billion CFU per serving so you will need a MUCH higher dose. <br /><br />Look for probiotics that contain: L. gasseri, L. rhamnosus, B. lactis, and L. casei as these are the most well studied probiotic weight loss strains. <br /><br />Here is my recommended probiotic supplement for WEIGHT LOSS: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.restartmed.com/product/gut-bomb-350-billion/">https://www.restartmed.com/product/gut-bomb-350-billion/</a><br /><br />#4. Protein powder. <br /><br />Protein powder is another GREAT way to help you lose weight. The right protein powder can help your body feel less hungry AND it can also promote an increase in muscle mass to help improve your metabolism. <br /><br />I recommend using PLANT based protein powder for weight loss instead of WHEY protein. <br /><br />Plant protein powder is rapidly absorbed and utilized. <br /><br />You can find my recommended PLANT based protein powder here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.restartmed.com/product/functional-fuel-energize/">https://www.restartmed.com/product/functional-fuel-energize/</a><br /><br />#5.
