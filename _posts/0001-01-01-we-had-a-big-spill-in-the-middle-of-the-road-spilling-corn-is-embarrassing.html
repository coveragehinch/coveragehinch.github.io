{% raw %}Spilling corn is embarrassing. Spilling corn in the middle of the road is even worse. Oh yeah, we also broke the combine, again. <br /><br />In today's episode, we started combining corn in the field west of Dad's, I almost got a semi stuck in the middle of the road, Cooper taught us &quot;how to walk the dog&quot;, and we ended up breaking our combine for the, *slight exaggeration*, 9,000th time this season. Harvest is now over 60% done.
