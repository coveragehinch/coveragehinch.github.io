{% raw %}God has given us a spirit of power, love and a sound mind. Fear is not of God and the bible is very clear about this. How many times are we told â€œDo not fear?&quot; In order to overcome fear, a believer has to seek the peace of God. The Lord Jesus gave us a reason why we must not be afraid. He gave us his peace, and you cannot have peace and fear at the same time.<br /><br />Christian Motivation<br /><br />You can stream Grace for Purpose Motivation and listen from anywhere:<br />AppleMusic/iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cutt.ly/jd1eSYg">https://cutt.ly/jd1eSYg</a><br />Also available on Spotify | Youtube Music | iTunes | Amazon Music | Tidal<br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ SUBSCRIBE &amp; ENABLE ðŸ”” for weekly Christian motivational videos<br /><br />â–ºAn original video created by Grace for Purpose and delivered by our team speakers.<br /><br />â–º FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA<br />              â¬›<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/grace4purpose/">https://www.facebook.com/grace4purpose/</a><br />              â¬›<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/grace4purpose/">https://www.instagram.com/grace4purpose/</a><br /><br />             â¬›Footage licensed through: Artgrid<br />             â¬› Music licensed through Audiojungle<br /><br />For any enquiries, contact us: teamg4p@gmail.com{% endraw %}
