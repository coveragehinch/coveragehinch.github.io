{% raw %}Sit back and enjoy this sad, but beautiful Christmas story written by Hans Christian Andersen in 1846. <br /><br />While the story tells about a little poor girl in the midst of a cold winter night, the last night of the year, it also highlights the importance of being kind to one another. Feel and spread compassion, love and warmth, as you listen to this quiet and peaceful reading. <br /><br />Close your eyes as you listen to this old story, relax and feel the magical Christmas spirit. <br /><br />The story about the little match-seller is now in public domain and the reading was made possible thanks to the Project Gutenberg. We thank Tim Mossholder for the beautiful photo used in the ending screen. <br /><br />If you like the channel, please make sure to like, subscribe and let us know in the comments what type of videos and sounds you are looking for.<br /><br />All the videos are filmed and produced by us.
