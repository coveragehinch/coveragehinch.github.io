{% raw %}Steve's getting dressed this in this English video story. He tries a lot of T-shirts and Maggie's skirt (ups…). After that, Steve watches a TV programme about animals. But he doesn't want to help Maggie, so Maggie uses her Maggie Magic to have a bit of fun with Steve. Finally, Steve and Maggie sing a song about weather together. Let's jump into this English collection for children with Steve and Maggie. Steve repeats words such as eyes, ears, a tongue, a mouth, a nose and arms. HAVE FUN and learn English vocabulary with our English lesson! <br />--------------------<br />VISIT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://SteveAndMaggie.com">https://SteveAndMaggie.com</a><br />.<br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/SteveAndMaggieOfficial">https://instagram.com/SteveAndMaggieOfficial</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/SteveAndMaggie">https://facebook.com/SteveAndMaggie</a> <br />.<br />SHOP:<br />SpreadShirt: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/SteveAndMaggie">https://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/SteveAndMaggie</a><br />Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/steve-and-maggie-1">https://teespring.com/stores/steve-and-maggie-1</a><br />.<br />APPS FOR KIDS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://app.steveandmaggie.com/">https://app.steveandmaggie.com/</a><br />.<br />ENGLISH TEACHING MATERIALS for kids: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wowenglish.com">https://wowenglish.com</a><br />.<br />SHOUTOUTS and personalised messages via: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cameo.com/steveandmaggieofficial">https://cameo.com/steveandmaggieofficial</a><br />.<br />SONGS FOR KIDS:<br />iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itun.es/gb/i_oMcb">https://itun.es/gb/i_oMcb</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/2hlcWya">https://spoti.fi/2hlcWya</a><br />.<br />Support us and receive a personalised birthday message for your child from Steve.<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/steveandmaggie">https://patreon.com/steveandmaggie</a><br />--------------------<br />Produced by © Wattsenglish Ltd. ©<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wattsenglish.com/">https://wattsenglish.com/</a>{% endraw %}
