{% raw %}Today is going to be a busy day starting out at the office with the morning routine of invoices, inventory, customer calls, etc. <br /><br />Later on, I'm off to the Cincinnati vs Alabama playoff game. We are hoping they pull off an upset because of the advertising we purchased would follow Cincinnati to the championship and be featured on ESPN, possibly giving the brand more exposure. <br /><br />After the game, I'm off to Vegas to ring in the new year with several dealer friends from LA. I'm not generally a club person but I won't lie, these guys know how to do it right. I honestly don't want to know what their bill was...I had 5 Redbulls, so mine was $67<br /><br />Follow Me On Instagram <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/anthonywfarrer/">https://www.instagram.com/anthonywfarrer/</a>{% endraw %}
