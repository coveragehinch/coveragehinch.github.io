{% raw %}Tough Cookie: A Christmas Story by Edward Hemingway. Read by Riko.<br /><br />Once upon a time, while Fox was visiting the land of Holiday Treats, a little cookie‚Äïstill warm from the bakery oven‚Äïburst out the front door looking sweet and ready to be devoured. But, as it turns out, Cookie is not as fast as he thinks and when Fox finally catches him, they‚Äôre both in for a big surprise: Sugar Cookie does not taste delicious‚Äïand he‚Äôs certainly not fit to be eaten. What‚Äôs an unsavory cookie to do? Is there another option for this not-so-sweet treat?<br /><br />TO PURCHASE<br />* If you like the book, please consider purchasing a copy to support your favorite author &amp; publisher. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tough-Cookie-Christmas-Edward-Hemingway/dp/1627794417/">https://www.amazon.com/Tough-Cookie-Christmas-Edward-Hemingway/dp/1627794417/</a><br /><br />MUSIC CREDIT<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />üéµ Track Info<br />Title: Christmas Village<br />Artist:  Aaron Kenny<br />Channel Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVAggfwI4hnkA2WO6-xC06Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVAggfwI4hnkA2WO6-xC06Q</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Storybook for kids | Bedtime story | Children‚Äôs book | Read aloud<br />#touchcookie #christmas #christmasstory #gingerbreadcookie #kidsbookreadaloud #rikosreadingroom<br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you SO MUCH for watching my video.
