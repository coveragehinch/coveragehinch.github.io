{% raw %}So called ‘honour violence’ or ‘honour killings’ are a reality for women all around the world; this talk looks at the stories of three women in the UK. From Kurdistan to the UK, Diana explores her journey as a campaigner and how she has fought for justice for victims.<br /><br /><br /><br />Diana has dedicated her life to campaigning for universal human rights. She spent 12 years on the front-line as a Peshmerger (Kurdish freedom fighter) but eventually her activism in Kurdistan Iran and neighbouring countries resulted in her facing persecution, which forced her to flee.<br /><br /><br /><br />She now lives in the UK and in 2002 she founded the Iranian and Kurdish Women’s Rights Organisation (IKWRO) an NGO providing advice, advocacy, training and counselling women and girls from Middle Eastern and North African communities affected by so called “honour” based violence, including forced marriage and Female Genital Mutilation and domestic violence.<br /><br /><br /><br />As Executive Director she leads IKWRO’s campaigning and successes have included the Justice for Banaz campaign which lead to the first extradition from Kurdistan Iraq to the UK of two of the perpetrators of the “honour” killing and the criminalisation of forced marriage in the UK in 2014.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
