{% raw %}The most common style of framing in North America is platform framing.  This is where you frame walls, frame the floor on top of the walls, frame the next set of walls on top of the floor, and so on.  For years we've platform framed 90% of our homes, with the exception being rake walls or maybe a two story entry or living room.<br /><br />This is the third time we've framed this house in the last 18 months and we had wanted to balloon frame it to decrease working at heights and save time.  Site access prevented this, but this time we were able to frame the walls full height from the main floor bottom plates to the rafters.  <br /><br />In part 3 we are going to cover how to layout siding on a wall that's flat on the deck, floor framing, ledger attachment, AwesomeFramers hats, and a final walk thru which I think will explain the whole process as its finished.<br /><br />Thanks for watching, stay safe everyone.<br /><br />Please remember, I‚Äôm not showing the best way of doing something, just what works well for us.<br /><br />0:00   Intro<br />0:41   SmartSide Prep<br />1:12   Squaring Walls<br />2:20    Prefab Closed Soffits<br />3:15    AwesomeFramers Hats <br />3:32    Layout for Lap Siding<br />4:10    Siding the Last Wall<br />6:57    Last Big Wall Lift<br />8:27    Standard Wall w/ Rim &amp; Guard Rails Installed Pre-Lift<br />9:27    Installing Rim Before Lifting<br />11:36  Standard Wall Lift<br />12:40  Floor Ledger Install<br />14:25  Strong-Tie SDWC Structural Screws<br />18:03  Floor Framing<br />20:26  Hand Nailing<br />22:14  Walk Thru and Explanation<br />24:06 I Joist Strongback<br />27:08 Explanation of the Mistake<br />28:20 Do the Windows Actually Work?<br />29:54 Closing Thoughts üòÅ<br /><br /><br />FYI, I am a Part 107 Certified Commercial Drone Pilot.
