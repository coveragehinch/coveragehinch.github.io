{% raw %}A carefully executed publicity campaign turned a pretty average pilot into an aviation legend. <br /><br />Subscribe to our channel! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/0bsAjO">http://goo.gl/0bsAjO</a><br /><br />Amelia Earhart is often thought of as the first or greatest female pilot of her time. But the real reason she is seen as an aviation legend comes from a carefully executed publicity campaign starting with her transatlantic passenger flight in 1928, which launched her out of obscurity and into celebrity status. From there, she pursued an ambitious career of record-breaking and stunts in order to stay in the headlines and fund her aviation career. <br /><br />Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
