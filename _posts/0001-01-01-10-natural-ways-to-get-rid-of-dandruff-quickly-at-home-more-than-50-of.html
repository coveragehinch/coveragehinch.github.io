{% raw %}More than 50% of the population in the US are affected by dandruff. Dandruff can appear at any age; however, it's more likely to do so when a person is between 20-30 years old. Such an inconvenient condition can usually lead to a dry scalp, hair loss, and have a negative effect on your self-confidence. Of course, those little white flakes can be embarrassing, but dandruff is more serious than a lot of people think. It can be caused by an underlying issue, be it a dry itchy scalp, a poor diet, or even stress! <br /><br />Yep! In 2007, a group of French scientists studied the connection between stress and seborrheic dermatitis, which is one of the most common causes of dandruff. In the end, they found that these two are, in fact, connected. Stress weakens your immune system, so it canâ€™t fight fungal and bacterial infections as well as it should. There are countless ways to reduce stress levels in your life. Just do more of what makes you happy. And instead of reaching for yet another overpriced shampoo, how about trying some all-natural ways you can be free of the flakes without breaking the bank?<br /><br />#brightside<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />Aloe Vera 0:10<br />Olive oil 0:55<br />Coconut oil 1:57<br />Baking soda 2:35<br />Aspirin 3:09<br />Lemon juice and yogurt 3:50<br />Apple cider vinegar 4:34<br />Tea tree oil 5:13<br />Fenugreek seeds 5:49<br />Egg yolks 6:16<br />Probiotics 6:54<br />Omega-3s 7:32<br />Relaxation 8:06<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
