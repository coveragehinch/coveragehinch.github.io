{% raw %}I came up with the idea for my version of an Auto Actuated Edge Clamp while applying edging to chipboard panels. <br /><br />The Edge Clamp works beautifully with a variety of different sizes, widths, and weight boards. <br /><br />It will be particularly handy when fixing hinges to doors or drilling pocket holes on the edges of large planks and boards.<br /><br />Time will tell but it already seems to be a good addition to my workshop. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />To support my channel visit one of our merch stores:<br /><br />USA - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/woodshop-junkies-usa">https://teespring.com/stores/woodshop-junkies-usa</a><br />EU - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/woodshop-junkies-eu">https://teespring.com/stores/woodshop-junkies-eu</a><br /><br />Or follow my projects on social media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/woodworkjunkiesite/">https://www.facebook.com/woodworkjunkiesite/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/woodworkjunkie/">https://www.instagram.com/woodworkjunkie/</a><br /><br /><br />Other videos you might like:<br /><br />Diamond in the rough table saw:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/kl0D19L3zYw">https://youtu.be/kl0D19L3zYw</a><br /><br />Ultimate Space Saver For Small Workshops:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/kIeuntHqOFo">https://youtu.be/kIeuntHqOFo</a><br /><br />Small Shop Drill Press Stand:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLL4TPJc4T3h9jeImkeejK_AoFM1DZ7jK">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLL4TPJc4T3h9jeImkeejK_AoFM1DZ7jK</a><br /><br />Some product links may be affiliate links which means that I may earn a commission if you click on the link and/or make a purchase.
