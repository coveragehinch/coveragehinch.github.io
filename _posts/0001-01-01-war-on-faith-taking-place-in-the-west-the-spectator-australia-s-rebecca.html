{% raw %}The Spectator Australia’s Rebecca Weissman says there is a &quot;war on faith” not only taking place in Communist China but also in the West.  <br /><br />“There is genuinely a war on faith because faith is so powerful,” she told Sky News host Cory Bernardi.  <br /><br />“We see this in Communist China, the attempts to eliminate faith or to subvert it and to try and bend it.  <br /><br />“Because when you realise that there is a force greater than you, that there is something that you have to answer to, that there is a life beyond this life, it gives people enormous courage. <br /><br />“And of course, if you’re a godless communist that is the last thing you want.  <br /><br />“We see it not just in Communist China, but certainly in the West as well.”{% endraw %}
