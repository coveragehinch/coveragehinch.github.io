{% raw %}2021 Polestar 2 review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/3mcSV0d">https://carbyr.uk/3mcSV0d</a><br />Watch our latest video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carbuyervideos">http://bit.ly/carbuyervideos</a><br />Sign up to Carbuyer’s FREE newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/32TH658">https://carbyr.uk/32TH658</a> <br /><br />The Polestar 2 is an upmarket electric car from Volvo’s offshoot brand, and is a direct rival to the Tesla Model 3. It bears several design cues from its parent company, giving it distinctive styling that blends elements of both hatchback and crossover. Under the bodywork it boasts a choice of rapid powertrains, offering a range of up to 336 miles. The brand has applied the same design techniques inside, too, with a luxury interior trimmed in vegan-friendly materials, and an array of new technology including the latest Android operating system. But is this enough to make the ‘2’ a genuine rival to the Model 3? Nicola heads to the Carbuyer test track to find out. <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to Carbuyer for new videos every week: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/17k4fct">http://bit.ly/17k4fct</a><br /><br />Tesla Model 3 review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/30IPD9t">https://carbyr.uk/30IPD9t</a><br />Tesla Model Y review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/3ydr8Q4">https://carbyr.uk/3ydr8Q4</a><br />Ioniq 5 review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/3sPLMop">https://carbyr.uk/3sPLMop</a><br />Kia EV6 review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/kiaev6">https://carbyr.uk/kiaev6</a><br /><br />Best electric cars playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://carbyr.uk/2jwb47i">http://carbyr.uk/2jwb47i</a><br />Best electric cars 2021: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/best-evs">https://carbyr.uk/best-evs</a><br /><br />Follow us: <br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/2KkYSrv">https://carbyr.uk/2KkYSrv</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/3328zBG">https://carbyr.uk/3328zBG</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carbyr.uk/3pOhQXK">https://carbyr.uk/3pOhQXK</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Auto Express magazine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://subscribe.autoexpress.co.uk">http://subscribe.autoexpress.co.uk</a><br /><br />Carbuyer makes car buying simple.
