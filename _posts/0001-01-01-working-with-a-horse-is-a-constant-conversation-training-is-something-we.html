{% raw %}Training is something we do with a horse, not to a horse. This involves a constant stream of conversation back and forth between the rider and the horse. In this video I give an example of what I mean by conversing with a horse during a short working session.<br /><br />I teach Good Horsemanship around the world helping people to understand the emotional and mental component of how horses operate to achieve both a willing partnership and bond and to maximize the performance potential of a horse. <br /><br />Web Site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.goodhorsemanship.com.au/index.html">http://www.goodhorsemanship.com.au/index.html</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Good-Horsemanship/275719312528545?skip_nax_wizard=true">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Good-Horsemanship/275719312528545?skip_nax_wizard=true</a>{% endraw %}
