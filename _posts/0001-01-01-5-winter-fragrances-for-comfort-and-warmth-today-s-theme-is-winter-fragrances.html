{% raw %}Today's theme is winter fragrances, and I made a selection of 5 perfumes I like and wear when I want something warm and comforting.<br /><br />Guerlain Shalimar (my flanker is Ode à la Vanille, but I recommend any version of Shalimar; they are all beautiful)<br />Hermessence Ambre Narguilé<br />Serge Lutens Ambre Sultan<br />Frédéric Malle Iris Poudre<br />Attar<br /><br />I wanted to mention attar in this video to highlight the traditional perfume style, and while I don't have a specific recommended blend, here are two reputable sources for attar: <br />Authentic -<br />M.l. Ramnarain Perfumers (they also have an Instagram page, which I recommend following to learn about distillation)<br />Ali Brothers Kannauj -- I visited their distillation in Kannauj, and I liked their attars very much. They also an Instagram page and can be contacted directly to learn about their products. <br />Affordable -<br /> Enfleurage.com is a reliable supplier of natural essences, including attar blends. Their selection varies, but I have their rose and lotus attars (made with sustainably grown sandalwood) and they are nice. I would describe them more as perfume blends, rather than true attars, but they convey the richness and opulence well. <br /><br />More on fragrances: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://boisdejasmin.com">https://boisdejasmin.com</a>{% endraw %}
