{% raw %}This video will teach you how to simply convert Digital Audio Out from a Samsung Smart TV to any analog AUX or RCA audio signal to plug into a mixer or your own regular analog speaker input. It's a very simple process that might frustrate a lot of people. The key ingredient is the Digital to Analog audio converter that you'll need to purchase. This won't work any other way.<br /><br />ðŸ”´ Buy Audio Converter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/digitalaudioconverter">https://geni.us/digitalaudioconverter</a>  ðŸ”´<br /><br />Ensure your audio converter is sufficiently powered via the USB cable that comes with the package. Most Tv's will have a USB port you can use to power the converter. The package also includes a Digital Audio Optical cable so you won't need to purchase a seperate one. The only additional cable you'll need is the 3.5mm AUX headphone cable or RCA cable (whatever your output speaker takes). <br /><br />Cheers<br />DT Unboxed{% endraw %}
