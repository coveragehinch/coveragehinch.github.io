{% raw %}Thank you for the watchings, likes, comments and subscribes x<br />Enjoy tne one of most beautiful song (lyrics here underneath) from the newly released ABBA Voyage album. This is the  6th song of the album. <br /><br />&quot;I Can Be That Woman&quot;<br />You're asleep on the couch with Tammy<br />And she looks straight up at me<br />The reproach in her eyes is imagined<br />But the pain that I feel is real<br />She jumps down and her tail is swishing<br />Like a feather right under your nose<br />And then you wake up and you're bleary-eyed<br />I say I'm sorry, I can see you've cried<br /><br />You look frail as you stand before me<br />Then you curse and kick a chair<br />And the dog, bless her heart, licks my fingers<br />But she jerks every time you swear<br />I feel sick and my hands are shaking<br />This is how all our fights have begun<br />You say you've had it<br />And you say, &quot;Screw you!&quot;<br />I say,&quot; love you!&quot;<br />And I know it's true<br /><br />You're not the man you should have been<br />I let you down somehow (Not the one I could have been)<br />I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)<br />But I can be that woman now<br /><br />You're confused when you turn to face me<br />Is it true or is she drunk?<br />But it's clear that I've hit my rock bottom<br />I'm aware of how far I've sunk<br />And the dog is the first to feel it<br />There's a shimmer of hope in your eyes<br />You can't believe it<br />But you're close to tears<br />Oh God! I'm sorry for the wasted years<br /><br />(Not the one I could have been)<br />You're not the man you should have been (I let you down)<br />I let you down somehow (Not the one I could have been)<br />I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman now)<br />But I can be that woman now{% endraw %}
