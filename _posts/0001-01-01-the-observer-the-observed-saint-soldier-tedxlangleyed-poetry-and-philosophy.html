{% raw %}Poetry and philosophy come together to discuss ideas on duality, life &amp; death and Oneness.  <br /> Saint Soldier is an Indian born, Canadian raised spoken word &amp; Hip Hop artist. His lyrics reflect his ideas around spiritual and social well being and the struggles we have as individuals and as a society. &quot;Music is my lover, the songs we make are our children.
