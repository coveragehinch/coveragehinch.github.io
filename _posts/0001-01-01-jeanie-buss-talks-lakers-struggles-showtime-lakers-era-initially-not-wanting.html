{% raw %}Jay sits down with the owner and president of the Los Angeles Lakers, Jeanie Buss, and they immediately dive into the struggling Lakers squad in 2021. Plus Jeanie talks about growing up around the Lakers in the 1980s when her father bought the team, how her father was advised NOT to draft Magic Johnson, and how much scouting has developed over the years. Plus Jay explores Jeanie's relationship with her late father, and how their relationship grew as he purchased these LA teams and she learned to lead them. Jeanie also talks about how her father set up the Lakers to be run by both her and her brother, but she had to take action to remove him after seeing how poorly the team was being run. She even jokes that she tried to talk her father out of hiring Phil Jackson, because with big personalities like Shaq and Kobe she thought Phil would ruffle feathers.{% endraw %}
