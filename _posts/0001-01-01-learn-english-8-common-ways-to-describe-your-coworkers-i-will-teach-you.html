{% raw %}I will teach you common vocabulary we use when talking about the people we work with. A lot of our time is spent working. We meet many people at work. I’ll give you positive and negative expressions to describe coworkers. Learn what it means to have a work wife, have a go-to, to be a team player, or to be going places. I will also teach you what it means when a coworker is a stress case, two-faced, a slacker, or not pulling their weight. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.engvid.com/learn-english-8-common-ways-to-describe-coworkers/">https://www.engvid.com/learn-english-8-common-ways-to-describe-coworkers/</a><br /><br />More English for work:<br />How to talk about your boss in English <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mlOo68azqlE">https://youtu.be/mlOo68azqlE</a><br />How to talk about your job in English <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OQ8g6uuzlBM">https://youtu.be/OQ8g6uuzlBM</a><br /><br />In this video:<br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:13 go-to<br />3:07 going places<br />4:26 team player<br />5:44 work wife/husband/spouse<br />8:06 not pulling their weight<br />10:18 slacker<br />12:08 two-faced<br />14:22 stress case{% endraw %}
