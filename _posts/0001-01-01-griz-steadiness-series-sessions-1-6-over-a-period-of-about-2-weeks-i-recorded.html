{% raw %}Over a period of about 2 weeks I recorded a series of training sessions with Griz. I've compiled those videos into one large video (35 minutes). If you're curious about how I teach dogs to have patience, and specifically how to wait to be sent for a retrieve, you might enjoy this video. <br /><br />The video quality is not great (it was a one-man job with the camera on a tripod), so I apologize in advance for that. <br /><br />Keep in mind that all dogs are different and yours may require different techniques, but these videos show a method that was productive with Griz. <br /><br />Also, this is 6 consecutive sessions. No training was done between these sessions, and the sessions were recorded in their entirety...you get to see every second of Griz's progression.{% endraw %}
