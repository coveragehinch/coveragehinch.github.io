This meditation is designed to help you tap into your own innate goodness and bring you to a place of true appreciation for the beautiful person you are.  <br /><br />In this meditation you will be learning to accept yourself as you are and let go of negative attitudes you have about yourself. It is designed to bring you peace, fill you with self-love, and help rejoice in the miracle of YOU. <br /><br />Focusing on what you dislike about yourself drains you of the energy you need to create a life of joy. It is time to throw off perfectionism and embrace your true and authentic self. <br /><br />Perfectionism is an insidious form of self abuse that deserves no place in your life. You are not broken. You do not need to be fixed. You are perfectly imperfect. Life is a journey and you are growing in wisdom and character with each passing year.<br /><br />It is time to come to a deep place of acceptance and let go of your desire to be something different than you are. Yes, we should desire to become better. But self-acceptance is a prerequisite to true internal change. <br /><br />I hope this meditation helps you find the peace that comes when you appreciate your own uniqueness and embrace the entirety of who you are. <br /><br />Because true healing needs to begin on a subconscious level. The reason that change in our lives comes so slowly  is because so often we exert all our efforts at changing ourselves on a conscious level. But your subconscious mind is actually in the driver's seat of your life. The subconscious mind holds all of your well-learned thought patterns and behaviors (your habits, good and bad). So on a conscious level, you may be seeking change, while your subconscious mind is directly working against you. <br /><br />Perhaps you have been struggling to come to a place of peace in your life. Happiness seems to elude you despite your best efforts. Transformed Women Academy is all about removing the subconscious blocks that are preventing you from finding true and lasting happiness in your day to day life - by teaching you how to directly impact your subconscious mind and create permanent, lasting change. <br /><br />To learn more visit: <br />www.transformedwomenacademy.com<br /><br />This meditation was created by Tiffani Cappello CHt, RTT, NLP. Tiffani is a Clinical Hypnotherapist and Transformational Coach who specializes in Transformational Hypnosis and NLP for locating and removing the subconscious blocks that are holding you back. Transformational Hypnosis uses tools and techniques that explore the subconscious roots and destructive beliefs behind thought patterns and behaviors. Once identified, these can be neutralized and reframed, so your subconscious mind no longer sends negative thought patterns and compels you toward bad habits. Then new, empowering thought patterns can be embraced by the subconscious mind and become just as automatic as your negative thinking patterns once were. <br /><br />When you transform your mind, you transform your life!<br /><br />For more information about Transformational Hypnosis and working with Tiffani visit:<br />www.tiffanicappello.com<br /><br />Also visit Tiffani on social media<br /><br />Instagram: @transformedwomenacademy<br />Tik Tok: @transformedwomenacademy.com<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/transformedwomenacademy">https://www.facebook.com/groups/transformedwomenacademy</a><br /><br />Please LIKE, SHARE, AND SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube meditations so you can have access to the new meditations, videos, and podcasts as I create them.{% endraw %}
