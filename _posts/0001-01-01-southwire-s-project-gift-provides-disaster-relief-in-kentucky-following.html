{% raw %}On Dec. 10, deadly tornadoes and severe storms ravaged and destroyed communities in six states across the nation. At least 50 tornadoes were reported during this time, and the lives of nearly 80 people were lost following the storms.  <br /><br />In response, Southwire’s Project GIFT hosted disaster relief drives across several of the company’s Giving Back communities and collected more than six tractor trailers full of much-needed supplies and holiday gifts for those impacted by these devastating storms in the state of Kentucky.{% endraw %}
