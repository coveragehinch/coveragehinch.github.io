{% raw %}The department of Home Affairs refutes reports that it has reversed its decision on the Zimbabwe special permit. The department says it has only reversed a circular issued last week because it created confusion. On another issue, the Home Affairs office is temporarily extending operating times at front offices and ports of entry to ease congestion associated with the festive season. <br /><br />Home Affairs Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, elaborates on these issues.<br /><br />Tune into Newzroom Afrika, DSTV channel 405 for more details.{% endraw %}
