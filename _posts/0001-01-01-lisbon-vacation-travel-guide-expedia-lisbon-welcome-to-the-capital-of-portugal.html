{% raw %}Lisbon – Welcome to the capital of Portugal. Explore the hilly streets of this coastal city and take in the rich culture here. Check out the top spots to visit. <br /><br />When ready, browse vacation packages to Lisbon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.expedia.com/Lisbon-District.d178278.Destination-Travel-Guides">https://www.expedia.com/Lisbon-District.d178278.Destination-Travel-Guides</a><br /><br />From a Phoenician outpost to 16th-century trading giant, from the Great Earthquake of 1755 to its glorious reconstruction, #Lisbon has long been a city of shifting fortunes.<br /> <br />On a #visit to the waterfront, find the city’s grand gateway, Praça do Comércio. Pass beneath the triumphal arch, a tribute to the city’s reconstruction, and on to Rua Augusta to another of Lisbon’s great squares, the Rossio.<br /> <br />Climb aboard Tram 28, which passes some of the city’s most iconic sights, then climb the battlements of Castelo de São Jorge to see the red-tiled roofs of Lisbon spread out before you.<br /> <br />Although the Great Earthquake reduced much of Lisbon to rubble, the ancient suburb of Alfama was spared. Lose yourself amid the cobblestones, where cafes, bars and artisan shops have taken residence in the dockworkers’ homes of old. <br /><br />A #vacation here will reward you with some of Europe’s most beautiful beaches. <br /> <br />For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it. <br /><br />More travel information around Lisbon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.expedia.com/Lisbon-District.dx178278">https://www.expedia.com/Lisbon-District.dx178278</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Expedia’s YouTube Channel for great travel videos and join the conversation on the best vacation ideas. <br /> <br />---------<br /><br />Follow us on social media: <br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/expedia">https://www.facebook.com/expedia</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Expedia">https://twitter.com/Expedia</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/expedia/">https://instagram.com/expedia/</a><br />PINTEREST: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/expedia">https://www.pinterest.com/expedia</a><br /><br />---------<br /><br />0:00 - Lisbon<br />1:19 - Torre de Belem<br />1:33 - Monument of the Discoveries<br />1:59 - Jeronimos Monastery<br />2:25 - Maritime Museum<br />3:00 - Belem Patisserie<br />3:15 - The Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology<br />3:37 - Oceanario <br />3:55 - Ponte Vasco da Gama<br />4:08 - Praca do Comercio<br />4:28 - The Lisbon Story Centre<br />5:19 - Triumphal Arch<br />5:29 - The Rossio<br />6:21 - Convento do Carmo<br />6:48 - Castelo de Sao Jorge<br />7:19 - Miradouro de Sao Pedro de Alcântara<br />7:46 - Alfama<br />8:21 - Lisbon’s Cathedral<br />8:39 - Fado Museum<br />8:55 - Fado Bar<br />9:15 - National Azulejo Museum<br />9:50 - Fronteira Palace<br />10:17 - Calouste Gulbenkian Museum<br />10:33 - LX Factory<br />10:57 - Mercado da Ribeira<br />11:14 - Cascais<br />12:00 - Sintra<br />12:52 - Sintra-Cascais Natural Park<br />13:18 - Adraga and Ursa<br />13:32 - Cape Roca{% endraw %}
