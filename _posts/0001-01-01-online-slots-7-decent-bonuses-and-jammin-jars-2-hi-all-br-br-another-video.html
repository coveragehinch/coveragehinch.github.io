{% raw %}Hi All,<br /><br />Another video recorded before the autoplay ban here, continuing from my previous video at Party Casino.  My decent run here is well and truly over, the last 4 videos at this site have cost me over £1100.  It seems a distant memory that I had a £2000 balance recently, let alone the £3000 a couple of months back.<br /><br />Still, I have had an incredible run, and having withdrawn £500 along the way I am still essentially playing with the house's money.  It does go to show that over time (with a little luck), you do see close to the advertised RTPs. <br /><br />Perhaps my strategy of playing slightly less volatile games than some other streamers pays dividends here, something I intend to discuss at some point. Nonetheless, it is clearly an absolute guarantee that the house edge will grind away your balance to nothing in time.<br /><br />Today I am still playing around the £1 stake mark and have managed to assemble 8 games for just over £600.  A decent start and a decent finish made this possible.  The downside today came in the middle, and no surprise was jammin jars 2 once again.  Another hugely expensive bonus that is not the giga jar.  I am not going to admit defeat without it (yet, anyway), but this game has cost me an absolute fortune now.<br /><br />This is the full selection:<br /><br />Twin Spin MW<br />88 Fortunes MW<br />Jammin Jars 2<br />Gold Cash Free Spins<br />Dog House MW<br />Hippo Pop<br />Big Banker x4<br />Eye of Horus MW<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this one, back soon.<br /><br />#onlineslots #slots #bonushunt{% endraw %}
