{% raw %}Hey guys, today the day after Thanksgiving I am covering for a friend. I inherit a job that might just be a gravy job. Once we take it up for the first look, I can tell you my friend must hate me. The job is a transfer case reseal in a much older Lexus SUV. Flavor is present, and leak was mis diagnosed. There is a very BIG TWIST at the end. All I can say is no good deed goes unpunished.{% endraw %}
