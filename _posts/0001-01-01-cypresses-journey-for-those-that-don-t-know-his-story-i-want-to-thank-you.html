{% raw %}I want to thank you for the the people who asked or read the description in his last video. <br /><br />I imagine most who have been subscribers for quite sometime kinda already knew 1. He was a wing amputee 2. Knew he was a rescue and 3. Know we love all of our birds dearly.<br /><br />I understand people may have questions that are new here and that's quite alright. If I feel it's necessary I will certainly add to a description to help fill in the gaps. <br /><br />What I will not tolerate is the harsh negativity towards myself or others. For people to come here and accuse me of cutting my own birds wing off is just preposterous. Saying he should of not been a pet, I mean really... he would of died. For someone to think that way is absurd and if that's your way of thinking then you don't belong here on this channel.  <br />Accusing me of clipping one side. Your eyes should tell you that if that much is clipped off, he would of bled to death so also a horrendous comment. Learn anatomy before being a keyboard warrior. <br />STOP ASSUMING, not only here but anywhere.  Ask questions!!!{% endraw %}
