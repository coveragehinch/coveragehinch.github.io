{% raw %}With the original Diamond and Pearl Catch 'em All being my most popular video ever on this channel, I figured you all would want to see what this challenge would be like in the brand new remakes! Today we're going to find out how easily you can catch every Pokemon in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. This video took a lot of time and effort to put together, so I'd really appreciate it if you shared this with a friend. If you have any suggestions for the next video, leave it in the comments below! Have a great day :)<br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Follow me on Twitter!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JohnstoneYT">https://twitter.com/JohnstoneYT</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitch!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/johnstone">https://www.twitch.tv/johnstone</a><br /><br />Follow my Twitch Highlights Channel!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/c/johnstonelive">http://youtube.com/c/johnstonelive</a>{% endraw %}
