On one hand bulimia and the tendency to ritual self devouring excess and expulsion of the necessary to maintain a neurotic control. <br /><br />On the other hand it is the story of an unrequited love, of the same excess of binging through the other and of an end made of distance and longing.<br /><br />Two topics related to each other through rejection, through a final unsuccessful recognition of what used to feed, metaphorically and literally.<br /><br />The closing line &quot;Never forgive, never forget‚Äù can be applied to both situations - to the rejected, thriving inside the loop of the distance and still unable to find peace. To the bulimic disorder itself, in its tendency towards repetition and annihilation.<br /><br />Love feeds. Love purges. Regurgitate and glorify.<br /><br />The video, created by Maksim Berg, was shot in Minsk / Belarus. Through the words of the director:<br /><br />&quot;When we do not accept ourselves, we try to appropriate or destroy what we like, fleeing from ourselves in mania, forgetting ourselves.&quot;<br />_________________<br /><br />Follow Kandinsky Noir: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kandinskynoir2/">https://www.instagram.com/kandinskynoir2/</a><br /><br />Listen and watch Kandinsky Noir:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/Kandinskynoir">https://linktr.ee/Kandinskynoir</a><br />_________________<br /><br />A Substitute for Love<br /><br />Could it be the deceit of these last days? <br />A sombre relief in disguise,<br />Could it be that we are caught in this slumber? <br /><br />And indifference cuts in the raw flesh,<br />The self in the siege it defies<br />Every memory, turning to absence.<br /><br />Dissimulate and move away,<br />As fate will grip you in its invisible ways<br />Your skin, so clear, a battlefield of desire. <br />Nothing compares to you,<br />A substitute for your love.<br /><br />And no matter how far you are,<br />These hands will reach you,<br />And no matter how Idle. <br /><br />All these bodies around,<br />Satisfying hollow thirst. <br />Nothing remains of you,<br />A substitute for your love.<br /><br />So alienated, so reckless and secure, <br />Your certainties crumble inside, <br />Within the retch your beauty is a facade. <br /><br />And when predators will seek for your secrets, <br />Your weakness will grow through their claws. <br />You will remember what it used to be us. <br /><br />And distance feeds morbid appetites,<br />The more you leave, the faster the hunt becomes, <br />Regurgitate and glorify, <br />Nothing can hold your fall, <br />A substitute for your love. <br /><br />And no matter how far you are,<br />These hands will reach you,<br />And no matter how Idle. <br /><br /><br /><br />All these bodies around,<br />Satisfying hollow thirst. <br />Nothing remains of you,<br />A substitute for your love.<br /><br />And no matter how high you are, <br />The lower you'll crawl, <br />And no matter this emptiness<br /><br />All these shadows around<br />Like your youth, they will fade, <br />Nothing remains of us, <br />A substitute for this love. <br /><br />Mirror, mirror on the wall <br />Dolboieb i pizdobol<br /><br />Never forgive, never forget.{% endraw %}
