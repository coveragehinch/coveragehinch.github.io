{% raw %}MISSED PART 1 of our interview with Sven? WATCH IT HERE at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/iKzGtI6Rljc">https://youtu.be/iKzGtI6Rljc</a><br /><br />This video is the middle of three videos cut from a 2-hour long recording session with stock market technical analysis expert Sven Henrich.<br /><br />Here, Sven walks through the latest charts and key patterns he sees with the VIX (the volatility index) and the major stock market indices: the S&amp;P 500, the Dow, the NASDAQ &amp; the Russell 2000.<br /><br />He is very concerned that they have reached record heights of (over)valuation in large part due to the tens of $trillions in monetary &amp; fiscal stimulus issued around the world lately, which now appears will be substantially reduced (by the US Federal Reserve, at least) in 2022. <br /><br />In addition to that, he sees just a few massive stocks (Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc) as responsible for driving the overall market now. Many other stocks are faring poorly, showing that underneath the overall index prices, the internals of the markets are poor &amp; worsening.<br /><br />If you've not yet watched Part 1 of this interview with Sven, you can do so here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/iKzGtI6Rljc">https://youtu.be/iKzGtI6Rljc</a><br /><br />At Wealthion, we show you how to protect and build your wealth by learning from the world’s top experts on finance and money.
