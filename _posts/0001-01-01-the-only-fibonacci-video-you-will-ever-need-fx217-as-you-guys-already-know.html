{% raw %}As you guys already know, I am not a fan of indicators because about 80% of all forex indicators are all lagging indicators and they tern to cloud my judgement in trading so I prefer pure price action and fundament trading but there is one tool which is very fascinating, unique and effective which I cover on this video know as the Fibonacci Too. So watch to learn how to better use the Fibonacci tool to generate signals in forex trading. <br />--------------<br />🏆 Looking for the Best Forex Broker?<br />I Used These Brokers.  <br />🎖IC Markets - Best Overall True ECN Forex Broker with the lowest spreads<br />🎯Fast Deposits and Withdrawals.<br />🎯Best Customer Service.<br />🎯Best for All Trading Strategies.<br />🎯Best Robotic and News Trading.<br />🎯For Both Beginner and Advance Traders <br />👉Sign up here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2W38hd2">https://bit.ly/2W38hd2</a><br /> ---------------<br />🕹Please Only use this 2 brokers below if the first broker IC Market is not available in Your Country. <br />🧩XM - Best For Micro Clients who can't use IC Markets or OsphreyFX<br />Sign up link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3tX28vY">https://bit.ly/3tX28vY</a><br />---------------------<br />💰Do you want One on One Mentorship from me, wanna get in direct contact with me or like my work and just wanna support the channel? <br />👇Click the link below to Join this channel and get access to awesome perks:  <br />👉<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jaTUfx">https://bit.ly/3jaTUfx</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />🏆The best Crypto Platform/broker  I use <br />🎖Binance - Best Overall Worldwide Crypto Trading Platform. <br />👉Sign up here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3k7KUZe">https://bit.ly/3k7KUZe</a><br />--------------------<br />🎯 Joint My FREE Telegram Channel NOW: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/ndemazeah">https://t.me/ndemazeah</a><br />🎯 Follow My Instagram 📲 : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3F8MzXq">https://bit.ly/3F8MzXq</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />ツ HOPE YOU GUYS ENJOY THIS VIDEO! <br />📌 If you enjoy this video, Please like comment and and share it. <br />📌 Don't forget to subscribe to this channel and press the bell 🔔 for more updates.<br />📌 Subscribe now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cutt.ly/Lnu9ACQ">https://cutt.ly/Lnu9ACQ</a> <br />⌨ Share your opinion by the comment below.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />📧 Email For Business Enquiries: support@godlovegroupltd.com<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />💰 SPONSORED:<br />No, this video was not sponsored.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />#fibonaccitool #forex #scalping #forextraderlifestyle #strategy #ForexChallenge #liveforex #forexstrategy  #forextrader #scalping #daytrading #forextrading​ #secretforexstrategy​​ #forexmillionaire​ #forexcourse​ #forexlife​ #forexmoney​ #forexmentor​ #investing #scalping #forextips #crypto #Ndemazeahgodlove #godlovendemazeah #godlovestrategies #godloveforex <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />What Are Fibonacci Retracement Levels?<br />Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur. They stem from Fibonacci’s sequence, a mathematical formula that originated in the 13th century.<br /><br />Each level is associated with a percentage. The percentage is how much of a prior move the price has retraced. The Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. While not officially a Fibonacci ratio, 50% is also used.<br /><br />The indicator is useful because it can be drawn between any two significant price points, such as a high and a low. The indicator will then create the levels between those two points.<br /><br />KEY TAKEAWAYS<br />Fibonacci retracement levels connect any two points that the trader views as relevant, typically a high point and a low point.<br />The percentage levels provided are areas where the price could stall or reverse.<br />The most commonly used ratios include 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%.<br />These levels should not be relied on exclusively, so it is dangerous to assume the price will reverse after hitting a specific Fibonacci level.<br /> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />⚠️ NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE DISCLAIMER: <br />We have done our best to ensure that the information provided here and the resources available for download are accurate and provide valuable information.
