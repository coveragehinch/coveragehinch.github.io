Although slightly disconcerting at first, cement is actually a really useful material in boatbuilding. Richard has been working on the Bulwark Staunchions, which are made of White Oak and will support the Bulwarks, a kind of fence around the perimeter of the deck. Pete has been making the aftermost deck beam, or transom cleat, which will support the end of the deck strakes. <br /><br />—-<br /><br />To become a Patron - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sampsonboatco">https://www.patreon.com/sampsonboatco</a> <br /><br />To donate or support - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://sampsonboat.co.uk/support">http://sampsonboat.co.uk/support</a> <br /><br />My Amazon Wishlist <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://a.co/76y5IZP">http://a.co/76y5IZP</a><br /><br />For sneaky previews of what’s going on in between episodes, follow my <br />FACEBOOK <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/sampsonboatco">http://www.facebook.com/sampsonboatco</a> and <br />INSTAGRAM <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/sampsonboatco.">http://www.instagram.com/sampsonboatco.</a> <br /><br />MANY THANKS! <br /><br />--- <br /><br />Music; <br />Busted - John Deley<br />Waiting - Andrew Langdon<br />Lonesome Avenue - The 126ers<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />110.
