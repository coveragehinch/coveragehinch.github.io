{% raw %}#whatisjadeprotocol<br />#jadeprotocol<br /><br />What is JADE PROTOCOL - JADE Protocol The Next 100X Crypto Gem OR a Scam?<br /><br />Jade Protocol is a decentralized reserve currency platform on Binance Smart Chain. Unlike DAI or USDC, which are pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, JADE's reserves are crypto assets held by the Jade Protocol Treasury.<br />JADE is a free-floating currency backed by our treasury supply of the stable coin BUSD. JADE tokens canâ€™t be minted or burned by anyone except the protocol. The protocol only does so in response to price. Each JADE is backed by at least 1 BUSD. If JADE ever trades below 1 BUSD, the protocol buys back and burns JADE, pushing the price back up to 1 BUSD. There is no upper limit imposed by the protocol to the potential trading price of JADE.{% endraw %}
