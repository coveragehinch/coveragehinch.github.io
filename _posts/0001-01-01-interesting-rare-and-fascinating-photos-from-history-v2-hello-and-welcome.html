{% raw %}► Hello and welcome back everyone. In this series, we are looking at interesting, rare and fascinating photos from history. <br /><br />IN FOCUS TODAY:<br />► This is believed to be the first ever picture taken with humans in it. You may wonder, where are they? This image in fact shows a busy street in Paris, taken by Louis Daguerre in 1838, the guy who invented the Daguerreotype process. But, due to exposure time of more than ten minutes, the traffic disappeared, apart from one man getting his boots polished, who stood still long enough, to appear on the photo and be forever immortalized in history records, even though his identity remains unknown.<br />► When I saw this photo for the first time, I thought this is some sort of anti-tank shotgun. In fact, this monster gun, is used to shoot ducks and it dates back to 19th century, even though this photo is taken around 1920s. It is called Punt Gun and can kill between 50 and 100 birds in one shot. As the population of waterfowl fell to a dramatic level, at some point US government had to step in and ban this practice.<br />► This rare photo from 1877, has just emerged in the last couple of years and it shows Billy The Kid, playing cards, presumably poker, with three other men from his gang. The Kid is wearing his distinctive top hat and waistcoat, looking more like a teenager than an outlaw. He was just 21 years old when sheriff Pat Garrett finally caught up to him in New Mexico, in July 1881.<br /><br />Please check the video for more fascinating photos from history.<br /><br />Featured in this video:<br />00:00 | Intro<br />00:13 | First Ever Photo With Humans, 1838<br />00:49 | World's Largest Gun<br />01:22 | Billy The Kid playing cards, 1877<br />01:52 | George Custer &amp; Elizabeth Bacon, 1860<br />03:22 | Jesse James &amp; Robert Ford, 1880<br />03:59 | Japanese Samurai in Egypt, 1864<br />04:17 | The Statue of Liberty's head, 1878<br />04:55 | Nine Kings in one photo, 1910<br />05:56 | Renoir, 1910s &amp; 1875<br />06:50 | Sergeant Stubby most decorated dog WWI, 1920s<br />07:16 | Mount Rushmore, 1932<br />07:49 | &quot;Lunch atop a Skyscraper&quot;, 1932<br />---------<br />If you have enjoyed the video, please show some love by LIKING, COMMENTING and SUBSCRIBING to my channel!<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />#MysteryScoop #HistoricalPhotos #PhotosFromHistory #InterestingPhotos #FascinatingPhotos<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />For any Copyright issues, please reach out to us first before filing a claim with YouTube.
