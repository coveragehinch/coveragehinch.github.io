{% raw %}Time capsule of the street styles worn by women in the late 1930's. Filmed by early sartorial film maker Ivan Besse in Britton, South Dakota, during the winter and spring of 1938 and 1939. <br />We originally published this in 2010. Women never went out without dressing up. Some lovely examples of 1930's fashion, dresses, coats, hats, shorts, slacks, boleros etc. <br />You can see this now in 4k, 60 fps here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/TKVLqi727Vg">https://youtu.be/TKVLqi727Vg</a><br /><br />Colorized and Restored by Glamour daze using DeOldify.<br />A deep learning based project to colorize and restore old images and film footage.
