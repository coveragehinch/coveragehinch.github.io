{% raw %}We are armed with a brand new 2021 Honda CR500AF and our man Neville Bradshaw is ready and raring to let it rip! This is going to be fun...<br />Neville Bradshaw is one of the most prolific 500cc 2 Stroke racers on the internet, he's done some special things on these iconic dirt bikes. But he has has never had the opportunity to swing his leg over and shred an aluminium framed CR500, until now! <br />We've teamed up with Andre and Brett to make some magic happen, they lent us their brand new Ally Frame CR two stroke for the day and we called up Mr. Bradshaw to take her for the ride of her life! Enjoy guys :-) <br /><br />If you want to find out more about these bikes. Drop Andre a message on facebook -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/andrebatore">https://www.facebook.com/andrebatore</a> <br /><br />Big thanks goes to VIP Motocross for providing an awesome track to ride in the British winter!{% endraw %}
