In addition to hundreds of live television shows and thousands of informal debates on the show, he's also engaged in formal debates and traveled the United States speaking to local secular organizations and university groups. He's also the producer of both the &quot;Godless Bitches&quot; and &quot;The Non-Prophets&quot; podcasts.{% endraw %}
