{% raw %}I live in the Pacific Northwest, that is the north west part of the United States. With evergreen forests, and the endless, endless rain, it was maybe natural that Scandinavian loggers moved here. 100 years later many of their ancestors were driving Scandinavian cars down Seattle streets, and many of them were Saab 900s. With it being a popular, well-loved car, it’s no surprise then it was Saab’s best-selling model, and it was maybe rather appropriate that the 900 sold over 900,000 before being replaced by the next generation model. Why did this large car use the same small 4-cylinder engine found in the Triumph Dolomite, and how did it fair against its Swedish rival, the Volvo 700 series?<br /><br />A special thanks to Graham Turner for the images of the 900 Carlsson. He has some fascinating vehicles available on his website: www.grahamturner.org<br /><br />If you'd like to support what I do, and get early access to advert-free videos and exclusive channel updates, please consider supporting the channel from just $1 or 80p a month: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/bigcar">http://patreon.com/bigcar</a><br /><br />Support me using PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/bigcartv">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/bigcartv</a><br />Big Car merch:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/bigcartv">https://teespring.com/stores/bigcartv</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/bigcartv">https://twitter.com/bigcartv</a><br /><br />My second channel - Little Car: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/littlecar">https://www.youtube.com/littlecar</a><br /><br />#bigcar{% endraw %}
