Even though my discipline is in the line of chemistry I was sure about my call at the age of 12/13 when I had series of encounters with God and I began to work towards it from that time. My transition to a preacher is referenced to an encounter I had where I was taken to heaven and I stood on a mountain and watched people going to hell and I was sent to do something about the situation of the people. This happened when I was 13 years old. And those moments began to shape my life. I couldn’t find rest in any other thing outside ministry.{% endraw %}
