But there are certain desires which seem very far and difficult to achieve, especially the ones that give true joy. <br /><br />Hari is Joy. Hari is also the biggest healer of all. Also known as Vishnu, Krishna and  Ram, Hari brings Intention, Attraction and Abundance to turn desires into achievable goals. <br />.<br />'Tat Sat' is the ultimate truth one has to live by to reach the goals. The ultimate truth is Karma. Whatever we do, stays in form of Karma. <br /><br />Combined with Universal energies of OM, this mantra gives one an insight into the deepest desires to turn them into strong goals<br />When chanted to or listened to, this mantra attracts positivity around you and strength inside you. it generates hope and faith in yourself. Your confidence levels go up sky-rocketing. You feel more at peace even while you continue to struggle towards your goal. The path seems much clearer and the goals look much brighter. <br />Nothing is unachievable when one follows the mantra with a true heart.<br /><br />OM<br /><br />The love, power and driving force which is the love of God,<br />The eternal substance of the Universe, from which all is made,<br />And the Universal Consciousness, the intelligence of Creation,<br />That is the only Truth, That is the only Existence.<br /><br />By repeating the mantra HARI OM TAT SAT, we receive the sbutle energy which gives us the experience of spontaneous meditation and initiates the process of unfoldment, purifying our minds and bodies. Chanting can be done either out loud in a group, or silently alone. Sit comfortably and repeat the mantra rhythmically and energetically for 15 minutes or more each day especially in the early morning. The length of time can vary according to your interests and capacities.{% endraw %}
