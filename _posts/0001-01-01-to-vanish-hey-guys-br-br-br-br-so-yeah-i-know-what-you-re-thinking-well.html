{% raw %}Hey Guys,<br /><br /><br /><br />So yeah, I know what you're thinking...well, no. I don't but anyways:<br /><br /><br /><br />Why is Spazzy posting a Beta when she made that spzii account for that. Well, this is more like a &quot;I want to ask a question&quot; as compared to a &quot;this is something I'm working on, if you're interested.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm going to take it down, soonish. <br /><br /><br /><br />Anyways, here is my question.<br /><br />Should I do the whole song to Zack &amp; Aerith? Or should I do a bunch of other Canon Pairings; and if so, what other pairings? <br /><br /><br /><br />I mean, the other pairings I could think of were Sarah and Snow (though I don't really have enough hq clips to want to edit with them) and Tidus/Yuna. (I thought about Vincent/Lucrecia, Ashe/Rassler, and a few others too, but I can't seem to just pick what to do...)<br /><br /><br /><br />...try to stay away from KH. I might do Kairi and Sora...but I don't like KH pairings much. XD<br /><br /><br /><br />Anyways, you're feedback would be very much appreciated. <br /><br /><br /><br />Enjoy--<br /><br /><br /><br />Song: Come What May (Moulin Rouge OST){% endraw %}
