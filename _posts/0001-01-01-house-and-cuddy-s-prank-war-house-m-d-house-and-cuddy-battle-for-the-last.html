A man (Frank Whaley) is mugged and suffers from a respiratory arrest. Though he has no memories of who he is, he can read the personality of the most dominant person in the room, applying it to himself to create a temporary identity. This is due to a rare disease known as Giovannini Mirror Syndrome. House becomes intrigued by the accuracy of this judge of character and manipulates the patient to judge others, while a team member wonders if House is more dominant than Cuddy.<br /><br /><br />Your favorite shows, movies and more are here.
