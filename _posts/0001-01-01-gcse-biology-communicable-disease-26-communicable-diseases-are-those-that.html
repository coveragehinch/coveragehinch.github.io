{% raw %}Communicable diseases are those that can spread from person to person, because they're caused by pathogens. This video considers what pathogens are, how they cause disease, the different ways they can spread, and how we can reduce that spread. <br /><br />Then over the next videos we'll take a closer look at:<br />- Viral disease <br />- Bacterial disease <br />- Protist and Fungal disease{% endraw %}
