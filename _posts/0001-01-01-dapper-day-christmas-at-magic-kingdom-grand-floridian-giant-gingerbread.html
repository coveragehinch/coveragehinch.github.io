{% raw %}It's Dapper Day at Magic Kingdom in Disney World, the best dress day at Disney! AND it also falls during Christmas time. We first made a stop at the Grand Floridian because it's decorated for the holidays and the giant gingerbread house is back! Then we head to Magic Kingdom to take part in Dapper Day and take in the holiday cheer. <br /><br />WAYS TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL!! <br />• Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/dani702">https://www.patreon.com/dani702</a> <br />o Donations help with monthly editing fees, equipment, gas, ext...

Created for fun to get me out of the house, go on adventures, and discover new things. My content will mostly be about exploring popular destinations, and my personal experiences, but also trying to bring you information on the places we visit for you to use. I love to explore and I love being able to bring you with me. We might go to Disney and other theme parks, a resort, a tourist spot, a historic site, or a roadside attraction. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and have spent 6 years living in Las Vegas, where I started my channel. In 2019, we moved to Orlando where there are tons of fun things to do! I also try to keep things positive and friendly for all ages. Come adventure with me.
