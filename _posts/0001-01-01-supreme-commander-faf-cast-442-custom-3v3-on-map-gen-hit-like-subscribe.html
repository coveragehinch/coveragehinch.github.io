On his way back across the estate, he and his junior colleague, DC Wise, were caught in a storm whose manner was so uncharacteristically ferocious for the time of year that the two officers were forced to seek shelter at the manor house. With no let up in the gales or the horizontal rain, they were both invited to stay the night. Mr. Auspley the butler had greeted them guardedly and had made it perfectly plain that both of them were to refrain from leaving the servants quarters since Lady Effingham was currently entertaining a large shooting party that had travelled up from London one day prior. They were however well fed that evening and the beds that were afforded them in the spare servant rooms, were comfortable enough. It was therefore a great shock to Burke when he was abruptly awakened at 2AM by Mr Auspley and the head footman. Both were clad merely in their nightclothes and dressing gowns and relayed in a lamenting tone that Lady Effingham was dead. <br /><br />Burke hastily pulled on his trousers and shirt and followed the butler down the hallway. As he passed his colleagues room he hammered his fist on the door and said, <br />      &quot;Wise, wake up man!&quot; The trio continued to make their way down the corridor, up the meandering stairwell and out through a panelled servants door into the main hall of the house. The transition into the finery of the main house was almost as jarring as the sight of Lady Effingham lying in an undignified sprawl at the foot of the main staircase. She was surrounded by a number of guests who had been awoken by the commotion and Burke detected a wide range of diverse accents from the group as they consoled one another. He asked them to make way as he pushed his way to the front of the group. Lady Effingham lay on her front and it was immediately obvious that there had been a struggle. Finger marks on her neck and rips in the night gown clearly pointed to fowl play and yet vital evidence could be being displaced  at that very moment by the hoard of guests crowding around him.<br />     &quot;Ladies and gentlemen this is now a police matter and I must insist that you all return to your rooms,&quot; said Burke standing to his feet and gesturing for them to move back further. &quot;Mr. Auspley will show you all to the servant's staircase.&quot; Slowly, the weeping gawkers moved off down the hall with the butler. DC Wise pushed past them, struggling with his tunic as he went.<br />     &quot;Oh,&quot; he said. &quot;She must have fallen...&quot; Burke sighed and shook his head. 'DC Wise' he thought, never was an inspector more inappropriately named'.<br /> <br />Check out the FAF Discord and help with localisation @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/z6JbTw5zj8">https://discord.gg/z6JbTw5zj8</a> <br /><br />A Forged Alliance Cast In aid of Community Awareness.<br /><br />Replay ID - 15865421<br /><br />Support me on Patreon @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Gyle?ty=h">https://www.patreon.com/Gyle?ty=h</a><br /><br />or<br /><br />Help me out and make a Paypal donation to - djfelixlighta@hotmail.com<br /><br />For Forged Alliance Forever Community Client please visit - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.faforever.com/">http://www.faforever.com/</a><br /><br />Download at - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://faforever.github.io/downlords-faf-client/">https://faforever.github.io/downlords-faf-client/</a><br /><br />Join us on Facebook @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/ForgedAllianceForever">http://www.facebook.com/ForgedAllianceForever</a><br /><br />Join Me on Facebook @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/Gylecast">http://www.facebook.com/Gylecast</a><br /><br />Like our casts on reddit and help promote FAF @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/vids_of_faf/">http://www.reddit.com/r/vids_of_faf/</a><br /><br />To send me FAF replays to be considered for casting, simply send me the replay ID number to either my facebook page or in a youtube or forum mail.
