{% raw %}Motivation is hard to come by these days, especially motivation on building wealth and managing your finances in general. That is why in today's video, we'll provide you will all the motivation you need! Although you can't ALWAYS keep running on motivation, you'll end up quitting that way.<br /><br />1% or less actually achieve financial independence, so that means 99% of the people are living in a delusion. And if you ask them what theyâ€™re going to do if you gave them $10 million or what they would do with their life, I guarantee it 2to 8 million of that will be spent in less than a minute.<br /><br />The first stage, in my opinion, is to remove your own shame, guilt, and justifications for feeling unworthy. There are a lot of folks who are berating themselves right now. When you create goals that aren't aligned with your highest values and then fail to attain them because you give up, you beat yourself up and believe there's something wrong with you.<br /><br />So, first and foremost, you want to figure out what you've done in your life, how it has benefited you and others, and then you want to sit down and ask yourself, &quot;What am I really going to do?&quot; Because unless you serve people, you will not become wealthy. And if you're not committed to helping others, you're living a fantasy.<br /><br />You must place a higher emphasis on serving others than on taking. And you must be able to devote yourself to something that is truly consistent with your ideals or you will not stick with it. You won't gain momentum and tenacity toward your goal until you have a forced automatic savings plan in place and are prepared to study and research on a regular basis because you value wealth creation.<br /><br />What happens is that each person has a set of priorities, values, and things that range from most essential to least significant in their lives. They become the most powerful and productive people they can be when they set goals that are congruent and linked with their highest ideals.<br /><br />Any individual that is setting goals and has intentions that are congruent and aligned with their highest values has the highest probability of being spontaneously inspired in the morning to get up and do it. So if you have an entrepreneur that's working in a business and they found what is most meaningful to them, they have found the tap dance to work energy that Warren buffet describes.<br />We tackle more upon running on motivation and why it can hurt you in the long run.
