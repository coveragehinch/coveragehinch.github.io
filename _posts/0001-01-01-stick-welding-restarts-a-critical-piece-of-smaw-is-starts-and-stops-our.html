{% raw %}Our Weld.com Advisor, Cliff Danis, talks about why mastering SMAW starts and stops is critical for weld tests and also for application purposes. He uses both 6010 and 7018 in this video, while stick welding and explaining what he is doing and why along the way. Cliff is an instructor at the Delta-Schoolcraft Intermediate School District (DSISD) in Escanaba, Michigan. <br /><br />If you have any questions about SMAW or any other processes, head to our forum where you can post pictures and ask for technical advice directly from our advisors and other Weld.com members!
