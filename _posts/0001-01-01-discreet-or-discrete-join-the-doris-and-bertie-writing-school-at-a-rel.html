Same sound. Different spellings. Different meanings.<br /><br />So how can you remember which one to use? <br /><br />First, let’s look at what they mean.<br /><br />Discreet ending in double-E-T means careful, tactful, deliberately unobtrusive or able to keep things confidential. As in:<br /><br />This information confidential so please be discreet.<br /><br />Discrete, ending in E-T-E means separate or distinct. As in:<br /><br />All materials are made of discrete molecules.<br /><br />So now you know the difference, here’s three ways to remember it<br /><br />First of all, discreet, double-E-T is much more common, so chances are that’s the one you’re after. <br /><br />Second, discreet double-E-T is most often used of people - he or she was discreet, for example.<br /><br />Discrete, E-T-E is more often use of things or even abstract concepts like ideas or categories. For example, ‘Biology is a discrete branch of science’<br /><br />The third and final way to remember the difference is to think about the letter e’s in each word.<br /><br />In discrete, meaning ‘separate or distinct’, the two letter ‘e’s are separated from each other by the letter t.<br /><br />In discreet, meaning confidential the two letter e’s are like eyes - the prying eyes you’re trying to keep something away when you’re being discreet.<br /><br />So remember E-T-E - separate or distinct.<br /><br />E-E-T - confidential, careful or unobtrusive.<br /><br />I’m Dr Clare Lynch of Doris and Bertie.
