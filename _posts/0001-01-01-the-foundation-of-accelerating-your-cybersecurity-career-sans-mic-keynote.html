{% raw %}Cyber security is a fast-moving industry how do you build your foundation skills for sustainability and accelerate your progress? Technology trends, the tactics of attackers, the available tools, and the surface area of attack all change the skills and profession significantly year to year. In the last 10 years, the number of specialist roles have exploded, which is a wonderful opportunity for practitioners but also much harder to navigate.<br /><br />In this talk James Lyne, SANS CTO, will talk about the foundations for your career and the value of base technical skills. More and more our technology interactions are black box. Few of us are editing Autoexec.bat or Config.sys to make their game work and most of the time computers just work but that is eroding understanding invaluable to faster cybersecurity progression. Learning and refreshing how computer hardware works, how operating systems execute code, basic programming, and reversing skills these are skills that sit outside cybersecurity but can massively accelerate the grasp of students when it comes to even very advanced cybersecurity topics.<br /><br />Join this talk and walk through history with James Lyne, packed with live demos of foundation skills and how they apply to security. Shell hacks, debugging, programming and oh so many memes. <br /><br />SANS Foundations<br />SANS Foundations is the best single course available to learn the core knowledge and develop practical skills in computers, technology, and security fundamentals that are needed to kickstart a career in cybersecurity.
