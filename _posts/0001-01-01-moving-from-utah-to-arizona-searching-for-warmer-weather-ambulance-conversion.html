I made this change to my life and you can too! Like, subscribe and comment - Lefty would appreciate it - he wants the adventures to keep coming!<br /><br />The Campulance is a 2002 Ford E450 Marque Commando 164 Class III ambulance powered by the Ford 7.3l Powerstroke turbo diesel engine and a 4 speed 4R100 transmission. Lefty is a 65lb Staffordshire Terrier (best I can tell) that came from the Verona Street Animal Shelter in March 2014 at the age of 9 months. We have been living full time in the campulance since July 2019.{% endraw %}
