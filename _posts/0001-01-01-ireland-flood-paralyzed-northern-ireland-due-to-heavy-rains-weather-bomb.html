{% raw %}'Weather bomb' brings heavy rains, flooding to Ireland, Northern Ireland.<br />A major storm swept across parts of Ireland and Northern Ireland, bringing heavy rains, strong winds and flooding to the region and leaving tens of thousands of people with no electricity.<br /><br />Storm Barra arrived on the countries' western coastline and posed what forecasters call a &quot;weather bomb&quot; -- a dangerous phenomenon that occurs when the pressure in a weather system falls by a certain amount over a 24-hour period.<br /><br />A busy road in North Dublin flooded, following by heavy rain.<br /><br />WEXFORD COUNTY COUNCIL said residents in one village saw flood levels rise to more than one metre in their homes after the banks of a canal burst.<br />The county and other parts of the south east experienced heavy rainfall, with flooding reported in parts of Wexford as early as 8am on Christmas Day.<br />A bridge collapsed at Wilton Bree and another bridge at Kilcarbry, Enniscorthy, has been severely damaged.<br />More than 3.5 inches of rain fell in Wexford over the 24-hour period with a “devastating” effect, the council said. <br />“Hundreds of people were forced to put their Christmas Day celebrations on hold as local river networks across the county became inundated and unable to cope with the staggering water volumes, described by many locals as “unprecedented in living memory” and of “biblical proportions”,” the council said.<br />Council workers including firefighters, road crews and civil defence volunteers were called in for assistance as flood waters breached river banks across the county.<br /><br />The council said its out of hours emergency phone line received more than 250 calls from people seeking assistance to protect their homes against the rising waters.<br /><br />“More than 3000 sandbags were deployed at scores of locations and while these did offer protection to householders in many areas, not every home managed to escape the flood waters,” the council said.<br /><br />It said the village of Bridgetown was one of the worst affected areas after a local canal burst its banks in the morning. This flooded nearby houses “to a depth of more than a metre”. <br /><br />“Fire crews and trained civil defence personnel used boats and rafts to assist those trapped by the rising waters. Many of those forced to leave their homes took shelter with friends and neighbours with others availing of temporary emergency accommodation provided by Wexford County Council.”<br /><br />#Ireland #WEXFORD #StormBarra #Flood #Weatherbomb #NorthernIreland #heavyrains #westerncoastline #dangerousphenomenon #Dublin #NorthDublin #Wexford #ChristmasDay #bridgecollapsed #WiltonBree #Kilcarbry #Enniscorthy #severelydamaged #devastating #staggeringwater #staggeringwatervolumes #unprecedentedinlivingmemory #biblicalproportions #Majorflood #WorldPhenomena #World #Phenomena<br /><br />Subscribe To Our Channel &quot;World Phenomena&quot; For Daily Videos <br /><br />ATTENTION: All videos are taken from public sources.
