{% raw %}#Spain #Volcano #Eruption<br /><br /> Lava flows out from the new side &amp; extends to the sea side <br /><br />Red hot lava from a volcano that devastated the Spanish island of La Palma reached the Atlantic Ocean late on Tuesday evening, nine days after it started to flow down the mountain, wrecking buildings and destroying crops<br /><br />The strong increase in tremor amplitude in the afternoon of October coincided with an increase in Strombolian activity. With the eruption approaching two weeks of activity, there is no sign of ending anytime soon. In contrast, the magma supply level appears to be more or less stable, judging by the visible lava output and volcanic tremor, which remain at high levels.<br />Music in this video{% endraw %}
