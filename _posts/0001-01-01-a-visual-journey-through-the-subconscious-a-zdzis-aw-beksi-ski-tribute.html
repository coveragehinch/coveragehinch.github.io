{% raw %}Zdzislaw Beksinski still amazes me to this day and is easily my favorite artist. His unrivaled skill to be able to visualize and paint his darkest subconscious thoughts, nightmares, and visions is unlike anything this world has ever seen. I felt the need to share his amazing art combined with the incredible music of Bell Witch, which go perfectly together in my opinion. <br /><br />Music:<br />Mirror Reaper by Bell Witch<br /><br />&quot;Zdzisław Beksiński; (24 February 1929 – 21 February 2005) was a Polish painter, photographer and sculptor, specializing in the field of dystopian surrealism. Beksiński made his paintings and drawings in what he called either a 'Baroque' or a 'Gothic' manner. His creations were made mainly in two periods. The first period of work is generally considered to contain expressionistic color, with a strong style of &quot;utopian realism&quot; and surreal architecture, like a doomsday scenario. The second period contained more abstract style, with the main features of formalism.&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zdzis%C5%82aw_Beksi%C5%84ski">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zdzis%C5%82aw_Beksi%C5%84ski</a><br /><br />Be sure to check out and support Beksinski's Facebook page for more art and info on his life: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/zdzislawbeksinski/">https://www.facebook.com/zdzislawbeksinski/</a>{% endraw %}
