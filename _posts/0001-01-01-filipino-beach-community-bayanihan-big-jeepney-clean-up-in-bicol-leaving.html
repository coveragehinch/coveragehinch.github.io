{% raw %}I AM LEAVING THE COMMUNITY IN CATANDUANES... BUT FIRST IT WAS AWESOME WATCHING THEM DO A BEACH BAYANIHAN CLEAN UP! <br /><br />This is my last day in Puraran.  I check up on the boat house building, take a few moments to soak up some awesome beach vibes, and then head over to the Municipality of Gigmoto so see the Bayanihan beach clean up!  I absolutely love the big jeepney that everyone was rocking.  Bicol and Catanduanes certainly is beautiful!  It is so wonderful seeing the beaches be cared for, and I am excited for the future when everything gets even more beautiful and blooming!<br /><br />Filipino beach community clean up...<br /><br />And bayanihan vibes in Catanduanes Bicol!<br /><br />POWER ON!<br /><br />*** NEW #BecomingFilipino Drone Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2H-TxqnKbM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2H-TxqnKbM</a><br /><br />*** FOR HAMMOCKS AND SHIRTS JUST MESSAGE VIAJERO OUTDOOR CENTER ON FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://web.facebook.com/viajerocdo/">https://web.facebook.com/viajerocdo/</a><br /><br />*** FOR MORE STORIES AND ADVENTURES CHECK OUT MY FACEBOOK PAGE: #BecomingFilipino{% endraw %}
