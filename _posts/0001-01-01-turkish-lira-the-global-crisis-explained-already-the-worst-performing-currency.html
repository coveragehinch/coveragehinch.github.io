{% raw %}Already the worst performing currency in 2020 and 2021, the Turkish lira has lost -40% of its value vs USD within the past month alone, with USDTRY currently hitting new all time highs on massive single day moves day after day. Despite Turkey’s government-reported 20% inflation rate, the central bank has been cutting interest rates against all conventional wisdom. The Lira meltdown is not some broad based “USD-Emerging Markets” matter- this is very specific to the idiosyncratic characteristics of Turkey, namely President Erdogan’s direct control over the central bank, and his highly unorthodox (i.e. completely backward) understanding of basic economics. More importantly, the lira is not isolated to Turkey - it poses enormous and largely unrecognized global contagion risk by way of the EU banking system’s exposure. Weston Nakamura has been closely monitoring and discussing the lira since the crisis began in 2018, most notably identifying its direct impact on gold and Bitcoin prices in 2020. In this video, Weston gives an update on the lira, along with a brief history, and explains why every investor needs to pay close attention to the lira as a potential catalyst for global market contagion and turmoil.<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Follow on Twitter for live market updates by Weston: @acrossthespread<br /><br />Subscribe to our channel now for more videos like this one: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rvtv.io/subscribe">https://rvtv.io/subscribe</a><br /><br />About Real Vision™:<br />Real Vision™ is where you can gain an understanding of the complex world of finance, business and the global economy with real in-depth analysis from real experts. <br /><br />Connect with Real Vision™ Online:<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rvtv.io/twitter">https://rvtv.io/twitter</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rvtv.io/instagram">https://rvtv.io/instagram</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rvtv.io/facebook">https://rvtv.io/facebook</a><br />Linkedin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rvtv.io/linkedin">https://rvtv.io/linkedin</a> <br /><br />The Global Lira Crisis Explained<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/RealVisionFinance">https://www.youtube.com/channel/RealVisionFinance</a><br /><br />#TurkishLira #Bitcoin #EmergingMarkets<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />This is pretty obvious, but we should probably say it anyway so that there is absolutely no confusion…The material in REAL VISION GROUP video programs and publications {collectively referred to as “RV RELEASES”} is provided for informational purposes only and is NOT investment advice.
