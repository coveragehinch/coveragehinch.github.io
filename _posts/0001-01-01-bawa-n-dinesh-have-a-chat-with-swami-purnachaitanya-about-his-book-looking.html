{% raw %}We have known Swamiji since he was just Alex - an enthusiastic little fellow from the Netherlands. We had first bumped into him at Art of Living's German Ashram... It's been quite some time since then and now he is ordained as a Swami - yet retains his sense of mischief and fun.<br />His book Looking Inwards is a lovely read and we have a chat with him about it.{% endraw %}
