This channel/community is inclusive to all but is also non-political.<br /><br />All gatherings held through the Wisdom of Odin and its extended community are private events held and organized by the members of the community. The only service the Wisdom of Odin provides is a place to connect with others of similar beliefs in the old ways.<br /><br />The Wisdom of Odin is property of Jacob Toddson Productions LLC<br /><br />#norsepagan #heathen #yule{% endraw %}
