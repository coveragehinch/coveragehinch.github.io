{% raw %}In this gentle fifteen-minute follow-along stretching video, physiotherapist Jay Milomo is joined by James who lives with arthritis. Together they demonstrate commonly recommended hip exercises for people living with arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions, including hip extension, heel to buttock, squats, knee hugs, heel slide and external hip rotation. This session will be beneficial in building strength and improving mobility in the hip joints. Designed to be incorporated into your daily routine, these exercises can be done anywhere and at any time of the day that suits you.  A couple of exercises involve lying down and they can be done on a yoga mat, on the bed or on the sofa. <br /><br />Time: 15 min <br /><br />Items to bring along: it would be helpful to have a chair nearby to hold unto.{% endraw %}
