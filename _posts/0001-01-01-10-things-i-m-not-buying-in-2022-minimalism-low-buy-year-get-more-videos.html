Can you believe it? Today, I want to share with you 10 things I'm not buying in 2022. I've ever set no buy goals for them, or low buy goals. Minimalism has made me look at a lot of things differently, and has resulted in quite a few things I stopped buying. So let's talk about some of the things I don't buy anymore.<br /><br />Of course, this list is very personal to me and my lifestyle. So no worries if you do enjoy buying some of these things! Feel free to make it your own, it's your minimalist journey. But if you want to start frugal living, or save money, then a no spend challenge can be very helpful at times. So I hope this video will inspire you with your own no buy challenge.<br /><br />I'm also sharing how I did on my low buy for 2021.:) Enjoy the festive season, everyone!<br /><br />Lots of love,<br />ðŸŒ¼ Vera <br /><br />FIRST TIME HERE?
