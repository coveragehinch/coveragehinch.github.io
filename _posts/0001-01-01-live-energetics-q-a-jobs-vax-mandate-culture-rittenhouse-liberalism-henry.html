{% raw %}I have a few topics to cover this evening. If you have questions about Energetics or other topics that would benefit from the Whiteboard visualization especially, please bring them to the chat discussion and I'll do my best to answer them during the live stream.<br /><br />Going to dig into the topic of vax mandates and finding jobs or maintaining one's relationship with their current employer if they find themselves in a conflict of values or belief systems relative to this issue.<br /><br />Should we establish a network of friendly employers?<br /><br />Why aren't we making it cool to resist this...because it is 'cool' to resist it and most people 'want' to...the lame position is accepting a flawed solution that many will have serious negative reactions to...what is the solution when faced with this dilemma? How do we respect people's right to accept whatever solution fits them individually?<br /><br />I'd also like to discuss the Rittenhouse trial briefly...more specifically the apparent awakening many on the left are going through as the 'real' details of Rittenhouse's case are revealed...many thought the shooting victims were African American but no...they were not...in fact one was a convicted child abuser with multiple convictions. Not exactly a guy anyone wanted around...frankly, and for the record, he was a bald white guy...not Black. Rittenhouse defended himself against a few 'white guys'...these are facts. He never shot a single Black person. Many on the left had no clue this was the case...which is truly amazing to me...and I'm going to discuss that in more detail<br /><br />...and briefly I'm going to revisit my Henry Silva material because I discovered something new when reviewing The Return of Mr Moto that I believe reinforces the notion that Silva was involved with dropping timeline clues in many of his film projects<br /><br />Google Pay Contributions to: rfchaosheart@gmail.com<br /><br />PayPal Contributions - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/gabrielcruz74">https://www.paypal.me/gabrielcruz74</a><br /><br />Cash App Contributions to: $Gabrielcruzresearch<br /><br />Venmo Contributions to: @GabrielCruzResearch<br /><br />Bitcoin &amp; Cryptocurrency Contributions Welcome and Accepted<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.coinpayments.net/$GabrielCruzResearch">https://www.coinpayments.net/$GabrielCruzResearch</a><br /><br />For consulting or other forms of contributions contact Gabriel Cruz at:<br />gabrielcruzresearch@icloud.com<br /><br />If you'd like to see more of this research please consider making a contribution to this channel.<br />Thanks!<br /><br />Find me on social media<br /><br />Twitter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gabrielcruztrue">https://twitter.com/gabrielcruztrue</a><br /><br />Minds<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.minds.com/gabrielcruz">https://www.minds.com/gabrielcruz</a><br /><br />Gab.ai<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gab.com/rfchaosheart">https://gab.com/rfchaosheart</a><br /><br />BitChute Mirror (YouTube Clips Archive Mirror)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/gabrielcruzresearch/">https://www.bitchute.com/channel/gabrielcruzresearch/</a>{% endraw %}
