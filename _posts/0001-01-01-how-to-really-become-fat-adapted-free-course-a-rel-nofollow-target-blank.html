It can take time to become fully fat-adapted and begin to lose weight. <br /><br />Before you give up and quit keto, check out these points, so you know what to expect. <br /><br />If you aren’t familiar with keto already, the goal is to go from burning sugar (glucose) for fuel to burning fat (ketones) for fuel. <br /><br />When you first start keto, here’s what to expect:<br />• Around 3 days in, you begin burning ketones (instead of glucose)<br />• Around 1-2 weeks, you lose a lot of water weight<br />• Around 3 weeks, weight loss may slow down temporarily <br />• Around 4-12 weeks, most people become fully fat-adapted (weight loss increases)<br />• Around 12 months, athletes become fully fat-adapted <br /><br />How do you know if you’re fat-adapted on keto? Here are the signs:<br />• You can exercise without a dip in energy<br />• You can go a long time without feeling hungry<br />• You don’t feel tired after meals<br />• You can hold your bladder through the night<br /><br />To speed up the keto fat-adaptation timeline, get your carbs as low as you possibly can and increase your fat consumption. <br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:<br />Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
