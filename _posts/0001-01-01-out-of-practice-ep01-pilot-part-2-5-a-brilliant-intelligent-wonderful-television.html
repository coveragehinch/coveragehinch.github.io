{% raw %}A brilliant, intelligent, wonderful television comedy series that originally aired on CBS in 2005. Starring Paula Marshall, Stockard Channing, Henry Winkler, Christopher Gorham, Ty Burrell, and Jennifer Tilly. With Emmy Award-winning producers Joe Keenan and Christopher Lloyd (&quot;Frasier&quot;). I believe it is one of the best comedy series this decade. I have not watched the CBS network since they cancelled the show.<br /><br /><br /><br />It is Ben Barnes' 30th birthday and all his family is present when he learns that his wife wants to leave him. This comes as a shock to Ben, a couples counselor. Stewart, Ben's father also stirs things up by bringing his young new girlfriend to the family affair.<br /><br /><br /><br />GO TO CBS AND CLICK ON THE LINK &quot;FEEDBACK&quot; AND LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU WANT IT BACK ON THE AIR AT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/out_of_practice/">http://www.cbs.com/primetime/out_of_practice/</a>{% endraw %}
