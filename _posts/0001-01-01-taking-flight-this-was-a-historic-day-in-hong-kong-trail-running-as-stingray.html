{% raw %}This was a historic day in Hong Kong trail running as Stingray ran the entire 43km Hong Kong Trail in a blistering 3 hours and 26 minutes unsupported.<br />After nearly 30 years in one of Asia’s oldest Ultra trail races no one has run faster than 3hours 39 minutes. This was already a remarkable time on such a technical trail, and set a decade ago by Will Davies when battling Stone Tsang and Daren Benson to the finish line. <br /><br />Stingray set the unsupported record 2 weeks earlier but failed to break the supported race record when his day unraveled from dehydration. Stingray said at the finish, “I feel so good today and not dizzy like 2 weeks ago. I also eat more and take some extra electrolytes halfway. It’s the perfect day for me and I’m so happy.”<br /><br />He continued, “ The new The North Face Vectiv shoes also are a huge help to allow me to run so fast. Today I felt like I was flying. I feel like I’m really back now after a few injuries. I want to thank Alain Chu the Needleman and also Joint Dynamics for helping me in recovery. And I must also thank Asia Pacific Adventure and again my coach Andy DuBois from Mile27 who always work close with me on my training plans.”{% endraw %}
