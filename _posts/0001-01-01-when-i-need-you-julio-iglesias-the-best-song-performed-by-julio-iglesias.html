{% raw %}(The best song performed by Julio Iglesias at Jakarta, December 1994) <br /><br />When I need you<br />I just close my eyes and I'm with you<br />And all that I so want to give you<br />Is only a heartbeat away<br /><br />When I need love<br />I hold out my hands and I touch love<br />I never knew there was so much love<br />Keeping me warm night and day<br /><br />Miles and miles of empty space in between us<br />The telephone can't take the place of your smile<br />But you know I won't be travelling forever<br />It's cold out..so hold out<br />And do like I do<br /><br />When I need you<br />I just close my eyes and I'm with you<br />And all that I so want to give you<br />Is only a heartbeat away<br /><br />It's not easy when the road is your driver<br />Honey that's a heavy load that we bear<br />But you know I won't be travelling a lifetime<br />It's cold out..so hold out<br />And do like I do<br />When I need you<br /><br />When I need love<br />I hold out my hands and I touch love<br />I never knew there was so much love<br />Keeping me warm night and day<br /><br />When I need you<br />I just close my eyes<br />And you're right by my side<br />Keeping me warm night and day<br />I just hold out my hand<br />Hold out my hand<br />And I'm with you<br />All I wanna give you<br />Is only a heartbeat away<br />When I need you...{% endraw %}
