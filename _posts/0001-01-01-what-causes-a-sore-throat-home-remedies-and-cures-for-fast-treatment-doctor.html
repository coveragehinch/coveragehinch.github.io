It is usually caused by an infection in the throat (Viral or Bacterial). Soreness in the throat may be the only symptom. In addition, you may also have:<br /><br />‚¶ø Tiredness.<br />‚¶ø Swollen glands in your neck.<br />‚¶ø Pain when you swallow.<br />‚¶ø A hoarse voice.<br />‚¶ø A mild cough.<br />‚¶ø A high temperature (fever).<br />‚¶ø A headache.<br />‚¶ø A feeling of wanting to be sick (nausea).<br /><br />We will then look at how to treat a sore throat yourself:<br />To help soothe a sore throat and shorten the severity of the symptoms, you can:<br /><br />1) Gargle with warm, salty water (half a tea spoon of salt) (children should not try this) - one of the most effective and inexpensive ways to try this home treatment. Anybody can prepare this as we demonstrate in the video how to do it.<br /><br />2) Drink plenty of water - when we have an infection our body will be fighting it and this can send the body in to overdrive. The key is to keep it hydrated and avoid dehydration as this can make us feel unwell. <br /><br />3) Eat cool or soft foods - Helps create a soothing effect on the throat. <br /><br />4) Warm drinks like tea and soup may also help (Avoid Hot Drinks) - Again as above, generally cooler foods are preferred but if you don't like bananas or yogurts then a warm glass of tea or soup can do the trick.<br /><br />5) Avoid smoking or smoky places - these can irritate the throat further and make your symptoms worse. <br /><br />6) Suck ice cubes, ice lollies or hard sweets ‚Äì but do not give young children anything small and hard to suck because of the risk of choking.<br /><br />7) Rest - Helps the body fight the infection.<br /><br />Consider seeing a GP/Family Doctor if:<br />‚¶ø The sore throat does not improve after a week<br />‚¶ø Often get sore throats<br />‚¶ø Worried about your sore throat - it is severe/ or you feel unwell<br />‚¶ø Have a sore throat and a very high temperature, or you feel hot and shivery<br />you have a weakened immune system ‚Äì for example, because of diabetes or chemotherapy<br />A severe or long-lasting sore throat could be something like strep throat (a bacterial throat infection).<br /><br />0:00 - Intro<br />0:37 - Viral causes of sore throat<br />0:44 - Covid symptoms and sore throat <br />1:45 - Bacterial causes for sore throat - Strep throat/tonsillitis <br />2:12 - Allergies and irritants causing a sore throat <br />2:34 - Acid Reflux may cause sore throat<br />3:07 - Worrying causes of a sore throat - cancer<br />3:53 - Home Remedies for sore throat - How to prepare warm water and salt to gargle<br />5:25 - Things to avoid if you have a sore throat <br />6:58 - When do you need to speak to the doctor regarding sore throat?<br />7:58 - Emergency causes for sore throat and what you should do.<br /><br />#sorethroat #sorethroathomeremedies #sorethroattreatment<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This video and content on this channel are not for personal medical advice.
