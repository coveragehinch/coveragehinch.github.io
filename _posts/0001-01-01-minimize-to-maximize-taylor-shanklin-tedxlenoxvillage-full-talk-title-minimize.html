Research shows that the American workforce is stressed, and many of us find ourselves chasing an ideal of success that often does not line up with our own personal gifts or passions. By minimizing distractions in your life and letting go of things that do not truly give you fulfillment, you can maximize opportunities for personal and professional growth. Focus on what matters, lift off. Taylor is a speaker, podcast host, and marketing innovator in the nonprofit sector.
