{% raw %}Freddie Sayers meets Bjorn Lomborg.<br /><br />Listen to the podcast version here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shows.acast.com/lockdowntv-with-freddie-sayers/bjorn-lomborg-climate-change-is-not-the-end-of-the-world">https://shows.acast.com/lockdowntv-with-freddie-sayers/bjorn-lomborg-climate-change-is-not-the-end-of-the-world</a><br /><br />As the COP26 summit meets over the next couple of weeks in Glasgow, we can all expect to be bombarded with disaster scenarios, replete with stories about our species’ imminent demise. Over the last couple of days, we have had Boris Johnson warning that it is “one minute to midnight” and Prince Charles claiming that this is “literally our last chance saloon”. And of course, Greta Thunberg has already made a few appearances of her own, accusing politicians of “pretending to take our future seriously” and saying that COP26 will “lead us nowhere”.<br /><br />Bjorn Lomborg takes a different view. His latest book, ‘False Alarm: how climate change panic costs us trillions, hurts the poor, and fails to fix the planet’ sets out his argument that, although climate change is a real problem and is mostly man-made, the panic and alarmism is counter-productive.<br /><br />// Timecodes //<br /><br />0:00 - 01:41 - Introduction<br />01:41 - 06:36 - It is a problem, but it’s not the end of the world<br />06:36 - 09:26 The positive impact of global warming<br />09:26 - 11:13 - Myth 1: small islands are doomed<br />11:13 - 15:21 - Myth 2: extreme weather is on the rise<br />15:21 - 18:30 - Myth 3: climate lockdowns are the solution<br />18:30 - 21:51 -  Myth 4: electric cars will save us <br />21:51 - 23:50 - Myth 5: polar bears are dying out<br />23:50 - 27:29 - Myth 6: cutting out meat will save the planet<br />27:29 - 29:55 - Myth 7: increasing wildfires<br />29:55 - 40:07 - What’s the solution?<br />40:07 - 40:45 - Conclusion<br /><br />#ClimateChange #COP26 #BjornLomborg{% endraw %}
