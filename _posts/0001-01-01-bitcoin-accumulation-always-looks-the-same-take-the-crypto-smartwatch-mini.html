Any trading involves risks including, but not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price or liquidity of any financial market. Speculative investments may also be susceptible to sharp rises and falls as the relevant market values fluctuate. Leveraged trading can have a proportional effect on your trading account balance. This may work against you as well as for you. Not only may investors get back less than they invested, but in the case of higher risk strategies, investors may lose the entirety of their investment, or more. <br /><br />Hypothetical Results Disclaimer<br /><br />Some trading commentary is based on hypothetical performance results that have certain inherent limitations and may not represent actual trading. Past performance does not predict future results. Predictions do not include the impact of market liquidity and no representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those being shown. Forward looking statements include words such as &quot;anticipates,&quot; &quot;estimates,&quot; &quot;expects,&quot; &quot;projects,&quot; &quot;intends,&quot; &quot;plans,&quot; &quot;believes&quot; and are based on this authorâ€™s current expectations and assumptions regarding the market in question and actual results may vary significantly from those expressed or implied. <br /><br />Before deciding to trade in any market you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. You should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
