{% raw %}This video explains what harm reduction is and how it benefits people who use drugs, as well as their families and communities.<br /><br />Harm reduction acknowledges that people should not need to stop using drugs to receive help. Research shows that harm reduction decreases the negative effects of drug use without increasing drug injection. Thatâ€™s why organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) recommend a comprehensive package of harm reduction inventions for people who use drugs.<br /> <br />This video is supplemented with a brochure &quot;What is Harm Reduction for People who use Drugs?&quot;, available at www.hareact.eu/en/publication/what-harm-reduction-people-who-use-drugs<br /> <br />The animation and brochure were developed within the EU-funded programme, the European Joint Action on HIV, Co-infection prevention and Harm Reduction (HA-REACT).<br /><br />Further information on HA-REACT at www.hareact.eu{% endraw %}
