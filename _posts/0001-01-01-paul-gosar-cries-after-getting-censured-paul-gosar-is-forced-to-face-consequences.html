Paul Gosar and strips him of his two committee assignments, the first time a sitting House member has been censured in more than 10 years.<br /><br />The action led by House Democrats represents a major rebuke to the Arizona Republican for posting a photoshopped anime video to social media showing him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden.&quot;<br /><br />#TheDamageReport #JohnIadarola #TheYoungTurks{% endraw %}
