{% raw %}TOUR TICKETS AND SHOW INFO HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.doctormikelive.com">http://www.doctormikelive.com</a><br /><br />TikTok has become a great place to see some of the most incredible human bodies in the world. No need to judge these people’s differences, rather we can celebrate what makes them unique (and maybe be a little bit jealous we don’t have their super powers). Today we look at long tongues, veins in body builders, double joints, lipedema, uvulas, wide necks, hard chests, popping eyes, hyper mobility and flexibility, spine spirals, third nostrils, extra pupils, ectrodactyly, spice tolerances, takis, peppers, capsaicin, mountain dew, caffeine, withdrawal headaches, armpit hair, toilets, popping blisters, chest compressions, eye worms, loiasis, clubbing and clubbed fingers, webbed fingers, syndactyly, veganism, pescatarians, splinters, a broken jaw, wood sculpting, vaginal odor, cellulite, family medicine interviews, and charlie puth’s head.<br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there’s a subject you want me to discuss or something you’d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don’t hold back!<br />-Doctor Mike Varshavski<br /><br />Help us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!
