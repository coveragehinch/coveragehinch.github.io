{% raw %}I get an email this morning from the New York Times. They are telling me they are making a video and putting me in it. How do you feel about the Chinese Government and State Run Media supporting You Tubers in China? Quite a loaded question. They were so nice because they also said that I could comment and tell my side of the story. Instead of commenting I made this video. What they though I was born yesterday or wanted to become famous because of their less than popular name?? Well think again guys. Gweilo Style honest and true.<br />Help support this channel. We try to show the good side of China.<br />Buy Gweilo a Beer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://prnt.sc/uzmmjh">https://prnt.sc/uzmmjh</a>  <br />Buy Gweilo a Coffee: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Gweilo60">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Gweilo60</a><br />My Paypal account: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/gweilo60">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/gweilo60</a><br />Children's Helping Hands Patreon Account: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Gweilo60">https://www.patreon.com/Gweilo60</a><br />Bilibili: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://space.bilibili.com/1105647919">https://space.bilibili.com/1105647919</a><br />Ixigua: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ixigua.com/home/1952374673900152/">https://www.ixigua.com/home/1952374673900152/</a><br />Weibo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://weibo.com/1455675991">https://weibo.com/1455675991</a>{% endraw %}
