{% raw %}a young woman recalls her relationship with her friend following her sudden disappearance<br /><br />a big special thanks to both of my tremendous media teachers and all of my patient cast &amp; crew who helped put together this passion project amidst endless assignments, sacs, tests, covid-19 lockdowns and year twelve in general - they endured shooting in 5 degree weather on a cold thursday night, filming in weird laneways in enclosed streets and suffered through my endless &quot;lets do it again&quot; or &quot;you're doing it wrong&quot; (incredible direction on my behalf) just to get the perfect take<br />but you know what they say, you suffer for your art....i think that's the saying?<br /><br />the film isn't necessarily of the high standard i anticipated from the beginning of the year or what my friends &amp; family would expect from me - an intense cinephile &amp; aspiring filmmaker - but after several re-writes, re-shoots, deleted scenes, fired extras and characters who were left on the cutting room floor, i was still fortunate enough to have something to submit as my vce media final for media units 3 &amp; 4 at all and that's something to be proud of!<br /><br />congratulations to all year 12 students submitting their art, vis-com and media finals (all year twelves too) - i hope everything turned out in your favour<br /><br />i don't own the rights to any of the music or sound effects throughout the short film - all of which are copyright free or sourced from imovie (yes...i used imovie to edit this, premiere pro broke two days before the due date){% endraw %}
