{% raw %}A bar owner in Limerick says some people 'get shirty' when they are being asked for their COVID-19 Cert.<br /><br />Last week the HSE said it carried out hundreds of checks and reported very high levels of compliance.<br /><br />Of 628 checks by the HSE, 74% were found to be compliant.<br /><br />However a sample of 12 premises visited by the Irish Mail on Sunday found 80% of pubs and restaurants are not fully checking the certs in line with Government guidelines.<br /><br />Just two out of a dozen pubs, less than 20%, visited asked to see a COVID Cert and cross-checked it with photo identification.<br /><br />Fiona is the owner of Bobby Byrnes pub in Limerick. She told Lunchtime Live her staff have been met with confusion.<br /><br />&quot;We're checking COVID passports, ID, we're taking contact tracing, if you don't have a reservation already we're taking your name and number as a walk-in.<br /><br />&quot;But interestingly, we're finding we're getting on a daily basis people querying why we're still checking them - and getting a little bit shirty with you that you're checking their COVID passports.<br /><br />&quot;They're saying 'Why are you still doing this? You're the only ones doing it'.<br /><br />&quot;I don't know if people are just chancing their arm or what are they doing.<br /><br />&quot;But every day you will get somebody querying why you're checking it, and 'Are you really going to check it' or 'Are you seriously asking for that?'<br /><br />&quot;And that's what they're saying to you&quot;.{% endraw %}
