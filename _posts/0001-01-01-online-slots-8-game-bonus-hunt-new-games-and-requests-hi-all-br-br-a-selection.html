{% raw %}Hi All,<br /><br />A selection of new games for the video today, and the first time I have made a video since the removal of the autoplay functionality.  I must say I am not entirely convinced about the methodology that justified the decision, but we are stuck with it for now.  My first impression is that it certainly isn't ideal when playing games that churn and are expected to give bonuses infrequently at best.<br /><br />Talking of potentially tough to get bonuses, I was pleased today to see that the new BTG slot was available to play, although given some of their recent releases was concerned it might be another dud.  Not the case from what I saw in play though, and the bonus itself looks to have an interesting mechanic whereby it awards the starting free spins and multiplier.  <br /><br />I note also that it shares the &quot;enhanced&quot; bonus idea from Wild Flower where landing a symbol on the final reel (along with 2 others) grants the enhanced version. This will be something to play for and I would hope rewards the player accordingly.<br /><br />This is the selection today then, entirely new to me:<br /><br />Golden Fishtank 2<br />Bankin Bacon<br />Big Juan<br />Pirate Pays MW<br />Lucky Clucks<br />Thunderstruck 2<br />Gonzo's Gold<br />Wild Pop<br /><br />The last game is the first one of the video as it doesn't have a bonus as such.  It gives 3 extra lives when you unlock the full reels, and each of these save you from a losing spin.  It has the standard multiplier build up that you get on these games, plus a mechanic that can drop wilds into the reels. Looks interesting, I will commence play on it and resume the video when the reels unlock.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this one, I shall be back in the week.<br /><br />#onlineslots #slots #bonushunt{% endraw %}
