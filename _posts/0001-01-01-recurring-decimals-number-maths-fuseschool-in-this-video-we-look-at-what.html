{% raw %}In this video we look at what recurring decimals are, and how to write them as fractions. Recurring decimals repeat forever. To save us having to write all of the repeating numbers, we can place a dot above the number or numbers that repeat. If all the decimal places donâ€™t repeat, just put a dot above the ones that do. All recurring decimals can be written as fractions. Writing the number as a fraction is even better than the dot. In this video we are going to look at how to write recurring decimals as fractions. There is a simple method to follow. We need two equations which have the same repeating part. We then subtract one equation from the other, to eliminate the repeating part. To get the same repeating part, we may need to multiply the recurring decimal number by 10, 100, 1000 or even 10,000.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to the FuseSchool YouTube channel for many more educational videos.
