{% raw %}The plaintiff says she bought a car from the defendants, but they never gave her a clean title and she can’t register it. She claims they knew exactly what they were doing, and she’s suing for her money back. The defendants say the plaintiff is crazy and sent her boyfriend to crash his car into one of theirs, causing thousands in damage. She was even arrested for threatening to harm them.{% endraw %}
