{% raw %}This is the second demonstration video for the TRAX RS-1 Rota-Synth, a new 8-step analogue sequencer which incorporates  a monophonic, true analogue synthesizer.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this part, the Glide control is explored, the sequence length is altered by setting a 7-position rotary switch, steps are added and removed using the toggle step switches, and we show the different effects available when the VCO is frequency modulated by the Low Frequency Oscillator. This has a waveshape control, for more modulation possibilities.<br /><br /><br /><br />The only external effect used here is reverb.{% endraw %}
