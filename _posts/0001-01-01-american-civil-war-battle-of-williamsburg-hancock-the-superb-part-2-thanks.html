Hancock leads his men in securing one of the unoccupied Confederate redoubts, but soon comes under counterattack by Confederate forces under D. H. Hill and Jubal Anderson Early. Hancock must hold onto his position and hope for reinforcements to arrive and exploit his &quot;Superb&quot; flank attack.<br /><br />Music from Flimstro: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://filmstro.com/music/">https://filmstro.com/music/</a><br /><br />Sources:<br /><br />To the Gates of Richmond: The Peninsula Campaign by Stephen W.
