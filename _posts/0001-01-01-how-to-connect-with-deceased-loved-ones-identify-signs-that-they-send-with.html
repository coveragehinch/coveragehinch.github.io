{% raw %}On today’s episode, we talk with Saje and Serena Dyer, the daughters of spiritual thought leader and the beloved “Father of Motivation” Wayne Dyer. When their father suddenly died in 2015, the sisters were blindsided by grief and thrown into an adventure from loss to understanding, as they came to realize their father’s teachings with a new urgency, intimacy, and power as they applied them to their lives.<br /><br />On today’s show, Maria and the Dyer sisters sit down for our longest interview yet! The trio talk about how to connect with loved ones who have passed, how to recognize the signs that the deceased may be sending you and how to find peace when someone dies. We also learn how to be there for someone who is grieving (as we know it can be uncomfortable sometimes). <br /><br />We hope you enjoy part 1 of this amazing 2-part interview with Saje and Serena Dyer. <br /><br />Subscribe To Better Together w/ Maria Menounos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mariamenounos">https://www.youtube.com/c/mariamenounos</a><br />Subscribe &amp; Review Better Together w/ Maria Menounos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/better-together-with-maria-menounos/id1320060107">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/better-together-with-maria-menounos/id1320060107</a> <br />Join Our Patreon: www.patreon.com/bettertogetherwithmaria<br /><br />Check out our BT Clips channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHMkQ9ASfIEwqvkR7KHu-FQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHMkQ9ASfIEwqvkR7KHu-FQ</a><br /><br />FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL! <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/bettertogetherwithmaria">https://instagram.com/bettertogetherwithmaria</a> <br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJD6vrkY/">https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJD6vrkY/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/432608110738691">https://www.facebook.com/groups/432608110738691</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/better-together-with-maria-menounos">https://www.linkedin.com/company/better-together-with-maria-menounos</a>{% endraw %}
