{% raw %}As we move into winter, cold weather and central heating can deplete your protective skin barrier which often leads to dry, tight and potentially irritable skin. Not only can it be sore and uncomfortable, but it can also affect your ability to stick to your regular actives-based skincare regime. It can also flare up your eczema, rosacea and even acne.<br /><br />Our skin barrier is the protective yet delicate outer layer of skin that’s made up of lipids to cement skin cells together. Acting almost like your skin’s security guard, your barrier works to keep out irritants, pollution and dirt while retaining moisture.<br /><br />In today’s video, I share 5 EASY steps to train your skin barrier to be in its best possible shape.
