{% raw %}If you ever see &quot;My First Level&quot;, you should probably skip it.<br /><br />Edited by JTX, Royru<br /><br />Applied some of the feedback in this video, as the video was made before the feedback was given on the first JTX Edit, so I (Royru) did some edits in response. I cut some black screens, cut some fat of the video, couldn't do anything more since it was an already edited video.<br /><br />Secondary YouTube Channel (Streams Archive): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCkJiW3y-XgG2KANSho_7x6w">https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCkJiW3y-XgG2KANSho_7x6w</a><br /><br />I stream regularly at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/royru">https://www.twitch.tv/royru</a><br /><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discordapp.com/invite/ZevYdtD">https://discordapp.com/invite/ZevYdtD</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RoyruKenshin">https://twitter.com/RoyruKenshin</a><br /><br />#SMM2 #Royru #Endless{% endraw %}
