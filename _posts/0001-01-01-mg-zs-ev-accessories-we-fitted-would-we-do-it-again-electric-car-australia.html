{% raw %}This is the perfect video for anyone thinking about adding accessories to an MG ZS EV or see what’s missing from the ZS EV off the showroom floor.<br /><br />We walk around the car and looking at over twelve (12) accessories one by one covering the availability, price, our thoughts on the functionality and value each provides and if we would had our time over would we still install them.<br /> <br />Welcome to @ElectricCarAustralia and our EV YouTube video showcasing the accessories we decided to add to our MG ZS EV. Electric cars are no different to a combustion engine car, owners want to add some extra bits and pieces to personalise them or increase the vehicles usability and we have done just that!<br /><br />Some of the over 12 accessories we added are genuine MG and others are aftermarket and we also give a sneak peek to a do it yourself vehicle to load (V2L) upgrade (separate video on that!!) we done. <br /><br />We walk around the car and look at each of the accessories one by one covering the availability, price, our thoughts on the functionality and value each provides and if we would do it again. We talk through a MUST HAVE ACCESSORY for the MG here in Australia and also another we don’t have as yet but are seriously thinking of getting in the near future.<br /><br />Some of the accessories we’ve added to our EV include a full set of mud flaps, carpet dash mat, front and rear floor mats, car seat, roof rails, fire extinguisher and lithium iron 12 volt jump starter just to name a few.<br /><br />As we’re covered in our other electric car videos, generally we’ve been happy with the MG ZS EV as a value for money electric car here in Australia but there are a few things missing and the extra bits and pieces we’ve added have really improved the vehicles practicality.<br /><br />Finally we’ve included some links below where you can buy most of the ZS EV accessories we discuss, either in Australia or from business’s which ship down under. We trust these help if you’re thinking of ‘pimping’ your ZS EV as well.<br /><br />So that’s it for another video.
