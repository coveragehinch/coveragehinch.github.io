{% raw %}What Mark and Faye Leveson have been through to discover the truth about the death of their son Matt is extraordinary. In September 2007, 20-year-old Matt vanished after a fight with his older partner, Michael Atkins. Atkins denied having any involvement in the young man's disappearance, and sensationally claimed Matt was still alive. But Mark and Faye always suspected Atkins was a cruel liar, and was in fact responsible for their son's death. However, to expose his deceit, and most importantly to find Matt's body, the Levesons had to agree to a horrible deal with the devil. It meant Atkins received immunity from prosecution - a free &quot;stay out of jail&quot; card - for revealing where he buried Matt. At the same time Atkins also gave police his explanation of how Matt died from a drug overdose. Mark and Faye say it's more lies, but in a major 60 MINUTES investigation, Tara Brown uncovers yet another surprising twist in this long-running case (2017).<br /><br />WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.60minutes.com.au">https://www.60minutes.com.au</a> <br />LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9">https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9</a> <br />FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/60Mins">https://twitter.com/60Mins</a> <br />FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9">https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9</a><br /><br />For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the worldâ€™s greatest stories.
