{% raw %}Someone just discovered a massive underground tunnel in Mexico but didn't expect to find this inside. Today, we take a look at this massive underground tunnel that was just found in Mexico.<br /><br />Mexico is a country that has a rich history. Every year archaeologists working here discover incredible artifacts, helping to give us a glimpse into what life would have been like here thousands of years ago. Each year researchers discover underground chambers and caves, sometimes these are emptied, but some of these are filled with artifacts and treasures. One example of this is archaeologists recently uncovered a secret ‘passage to the underworld’ at Pyramid of the Moon in Teotihuacan.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Thank you to CO.AG for the background music!{% endraw %}
