{% raw %}The Dream You Need<br />X Ambassadors - Loveless (Lyrics)<br /><br />Young hearts broken in<br />Stolen parts, secondhand<br />You came, you came around<br />I was dried up, was broken down<br /><br />I can't find it, can't find it<br />The road I traveled on is gone<br />I can't find it, can't find it<br />And I can't go on<br /><br />I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless<br />I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless<br />I can't give you love cause I'm helpless, helpless<br />I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless<br />I can't give you love<br /><br />Fickle heart, fickle mind<br />I gave it all, she robbed me blind<br />When I met you, I was half a man<br />With half a heart and half a chance<br /><br />I can't find it, can't find it<br />The road I traveled on is gone<br />I can't find it, can't find it<br />And I can't go on<br /><br />I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless<br />I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless<br />I can't give you love cause I'm helpless, helpless<br />I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless<br />I can't give you love<br /><br />I can't give you my love<br />I can't give up on you<br />Give you the stars up above<br />I can't<br /><br />I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless<br />I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless<br />I can't give you love cause I'm helpless, helpless<br />I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless<br />I can't give you love<br />I can't give you love<br />I can't give you love{% endraw %}
