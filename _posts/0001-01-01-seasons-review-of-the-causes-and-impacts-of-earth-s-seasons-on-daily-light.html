{% raw %}Review of the causes and impacts of Earth's seasons on daily light cycles and heat input. Designed for an introductory oceanography course. To access version with CC and scripts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ccsf.edu/en/educational-programs/school-and-departments/school-of-science-and-mathematics/earth-sciences/Courses/EarthRocks.html.">http://www.ccsf.edu/en/educational-programs/school-and-departments/school-of-science-and-mathematics/earth-sciences/Courses/EarthRocks.html.</a> <br /><br />NOTE: This video keeps the content simple. But for those who want to dig deeper, Earth rotates around its own axis once every 23 hours and 56 minutes. It takes another 4 minutes more rotation each to face the Sun again. So when we talk about a day = 24 hours, we are really saying the time it takes to return us always returning to facing the Sun. (Technically called a &quot;solar day.&quot;) Multiply 4 minutes per day by 1/2 a year and you get about 12 hours. By the time we get to the other side of Earth's orbit, we are about 12 hours rotated from where we were on the other side. The result is that noon always ends up with us almost directly under the Sun depending on where you live in a time zone. We don't notice this 12-hour rotation unless we look at the stars in the sky (the &quot;fixed objects&quot; against which we can see our motion). That's why we see different constellations at night depending on the time of the year.{% endraw %}
