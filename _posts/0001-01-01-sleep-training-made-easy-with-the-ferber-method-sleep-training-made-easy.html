{% raw %}Sleep training made easy with the Ferber Method!<br /><br />First and foremost, This method is not for everyone, if it causes parents too much stress or anxiety you do not have to do it. The goal of the method is to teach the child to self sooth with reminders that “mommy and daddy are always here.” It is not meant to just let the child cry it out, or to be cruel. Use your best judgement, no one knows your child better than you. <br /><br />With that said, Almost all parents of young infants are in need of more sleep. <br /><br />In this video, we REVIEW a popular sleep training method, the Ferber Method. The Ferber Method teaches babies to self-soothe by allowing the child to cry for a predetermined amount of time before receiving  brief comfort from the parents to remind the child they are not alone. Overtime these intervals slowly increase.<br /><br />We discuss the reasons why sleep training is beneficial for the health of both the infant and the family unit. <br /><br />Sleep training will ultimately lead to better quality, consistent sleep for your child which is necessary for proper infant growth and development. And adequate sleep in adults is linked to lower levels of anxiety, stress and proper weight management.  <br /><br />We also review why the best age to sleep train a baby is between 4-6 months of age, when infants are capable of self soothing but before they can sit up. <br /><br />Check out our video on sleep training using the Ferber Method!{% endraw %}
