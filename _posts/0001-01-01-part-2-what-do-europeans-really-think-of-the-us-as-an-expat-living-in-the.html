{% raw %}As an expat living in the Netherlands / Europe you start to realize how Europeans really feel about the US...it's interesting! Everything from education in the US to health insurance to what we eat and how loud we can be! You know...I really can't disagree with 95% of everything that was said. It's no secret that the US is struggling in this current day and age and Europeans are taking note. So what do Europeans really think of the US? I think like any where else it depends who you talk to. I don't think it's really Europe vs the US or living in the Netherlands is the end all beat all. I just think we have found a home here in the Netherlands and our love foe it continues to grow...and we're happy here!{% endraw %}
