{% raw %}Need help buying your next car? Click the following link and my team and I will help you choose your ideal car at a fair price - from Mat Watson! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/-Help-Me-carwow">http://bit.ly/-Help-Me-carwow</a><br />.............................................................<br /><br />Lexus &amp; Toyota have unveiled an incredible range of new cars this week, including what looks like a new LFA &amp; MR2! In total, 15 new vehicles have been unveiled, ranging from sports cars to vans and one-person city cars! <br /><br />Ok, so these may just be concepts rather than actual cars, but itâ€™s already been confirmed that all the cars on show in this video will help influence actual production cars before the year 2030! <br /><br />So all we have left to ask is - which are you most excited about? Obviously, the new LFA looks incredible, but perhaps youâ€™re more excited about the oh-so-cool Compact Cruiser? All we know is, youâ€™ll need to stick with Mat to check them all out! <br /><br />.............................................................<br />Instagram â€“Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/carwow">http://www.instagram.com/carwow</a><br /><br />Tiktok -Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow">https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow</a><br /><br />Facebook â€“Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk">http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Twitter â€“Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk">http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Sign Up to our Newsletter â€“Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter">http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter</a><br /><br />Awkward haggling is a thing of the past with carwow.
