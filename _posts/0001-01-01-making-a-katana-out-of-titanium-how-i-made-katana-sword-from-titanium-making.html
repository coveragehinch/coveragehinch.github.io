{% raw %}Making a Katana from titanium or how I made a Katana sword from titanium, to be honest, I myself did not figure out the name.<br />I'll leave this question to the viewer's judgment, to share your opinion after watching the video.<br /><br />I think there are few people among us who have not seen films about the Samurai.<br />As someone who deeply respects Japanese culture, I have always admired this sword.<br />Japanese craftsmen have invested many years of their lives making a real work of art in the form of a Katana sword.<br />I have always dreamed of having a Katana sword in my collection, but not everyone can afford such pleasure, so I decided to make this sword myself.<br />There are a lot of videos on YouTube showing the process of making a Japanese Katana Samurai sword from different materials, a Katana from a Chain, a Katana from Damascus steel, there is even a video showing the process of making a katana sword from a large wrench.<br /><br />Since I love the high-tech approach, I decided to make a titanium katana sword using all the tools and machines I have in my workshop.<br />As tests have shown, this titanium Katana sword was not only beautiful to look at, but also very durable.<br />I think this will not be a bad copy for my personal collection.<br /><br /><br /><br />By the way, in this video you will see my new purchases.<br />I found an opportunity to buy professional equipment directly from the manufacturer.<br />They have everything you need for your workshop, garage or production workshop.<br />I was very pleased with the quality of everything that I purchased from them, as well as with the service and of course the after sales who helped me set up the equipment.<br />I advise you to visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.stahlwerk-schweissgeraete.de/">https://www.stahlwerk-schweissgeraete.de/</a><br /><br />Stahlwerk-Shweissgeraete just right!<br /><br /><br />Friends,<br />As you may have noticed, I read almost every comment and I am always with you.<br />So don't be lazy to share this video with your friends and even your boss at work.<br />And if you are not at work, then show this video to your friends.<br /><br />Always with you<br /><br />Sincerely<br />Meanwhile in the garage<br /><br />#KatanaSword<br />#SamuraiKatanaSword<br />#japanesekatanasword<br />#forgingakatana<br />#makingofKatana<br />#makingofjapanesekatanasword<br />#meanwhileinthegarage{% endraw %}
