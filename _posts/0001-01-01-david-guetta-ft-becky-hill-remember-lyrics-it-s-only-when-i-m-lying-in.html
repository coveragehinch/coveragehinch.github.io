Becky Hill - Remember<br />00:01 I'm doing just fine now it's over<br />00:04 I've been moving on and living my life<br />00:09 But occasionally I lose composure<br />00:12 And I can't get you out of my mind<br />00:16 If I could go back in time<br />00:20 I'd do things differently, yeah, I wouldn't think twice<br />00:24 I distract myself, think of someone else<br />00:28 But every now and then you remind me<br />00:31 It's only when I'm lying in bed on my own<br />00:35 And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone<br />00:39 It's in the moments where I think that I'm better alone<br />00:43 That's when I remember, that's when I remember<br />00:47 Every time I walk past your house in the rain<br />00:51 And I tell myself that you were the biggest mistake<br />00:54 And just when I think I'm finally doing okay<br />00:58 That's when I remember, that's when I remember<br />01:03 My friends tell me I shouldn't listen<br />01:06 To the voices that go 'round in my head<br />01:11 So I try to delete all the memories<br />01:15 But you're really hard to forget<br />01:18 If I could go back in time<br />01:22 I'd do things differently, I wouldn't think twice<br />01:26 I distract myself, think of someone else<br />01:30 But every now and then you remind me<br />01:33 It's only when I'm lying in bed on my own<br />01:37 And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone<br />01:41 It's in the moments where I think that I'm better alone<br />01:45 That's when I remember, that's when I remember<br />01:49 Every time I walk past your house in the rain<br />01:52 And I tell myself that you were the biggest mistake<br />01:56 And just when I think I'm finally doing okay<br />02:00 That's when I remember, that's when I remember<br />02:04 I'm missing you<br />02:08 You<br />02:13 I'm missing you<br />02:16 You<br />02:20 It's only when I'm lying in bed on my own<br />02:23 And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone<br />02:27 It's in the moments where I think that I'm better alone<br />02:31 That's when I remember, that's when I remember<br /><br />#DavidGuetta #Remember #MusicCavier{% endraw %}
