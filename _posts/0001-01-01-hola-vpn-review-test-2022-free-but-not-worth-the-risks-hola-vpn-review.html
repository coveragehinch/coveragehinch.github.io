What‚Äôs happening?! Adam here! And In today‚Äôs video I‚Äôm going to take a good look at Hola VPN and whether it‚Äôs worth your time and money.<br />Now, Hola is one of the better-known titles  associated with VPNs.  This service has amassed over 180 million users since its launch in 2012 and is a product of the Israel-based Hola Networks. It markets itself as the first peer-to-peer VPN on the market. So, How is it different than other VPNs? <br />Well, For starters, Hola makes users share their bandwidth with one another. As a result, You won‚Äôt be able to hide your IP address by connecting to a foreign server operated by Hola. In fact, You‚Äôll likely be using someone else‚Äôs IP address, while another stranger will have connected to yours.<br />Of course, Hola is big on its peer-to-peer model. But this makes me question whether it brings  any value to users, or instead, is it just a cheap move that benefits the company while exposing you to serious risks?<br />Now, Hola isn‚Äôt a traditional VPN by any means. It‚Äôs what is called a ‚Äúfreemium‚Äù service, meaning you can use it without paying anything. Then if you want,  you can subscribe to the Plus package and pay for the extra features.<br />Unfortunately, The peer-to-peer model isn‚Äôt the only thing I didn't love. In my tests, Hola wasn‚Äôt reliable and I had trouble with some websites.<br />So is there anything that Hola does well? Let‚Äôs take a closer look and find out! <br />Okay, the first thing that I tested was its speeds, and to be fair it was decent. But here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äì Hola VPN isn‚Äôt an actual VPN but rather a peer-to-peer proxy service.<br />So, with confusing advertising aside, this might be good if you‚Äôre mostly interested in speed.<br />Now, I tested Hola on a 75 Mbps connection. And The UK connection test delivered some great results. Of course, You‚Äôre not likely to notice a 1.2% decrease in speeds. Actually, the UK connection managed to unclog my upload speeds a bit! Because of this, I expected a decent showing from the U.S. connection as well. Again, The results I got were not bad at all, considering my test location is far away in Europe. So, Even though my speeds were cut in half, the U.S. connection was still good enough for hassle-free browsing.<br />Then, since I was Impressed with those e results, I checked out an Australian connection. Yes, I was hoping for a pleasant surprise. And, the download speed decreasing by 83.8% was expected because of the distance between locations. However, the upload speed dropped by 97.6% and was close to unusable.<br />Still keep in mind that these numbers will likely improve the closer you are to the connection source.<br />Yes, Overall, Hola was able to deliver great speeds. Which was Not a surprise, considering it‚Äôs a proxy tunnel without any encryption to slow it down. <br />So, If you‚Äôre looking for a true  VPN that can encrypt your data while maintaining or even increasing your connection speed, I'd suggest ExpressVPN. And, I‚Äôll put some links for you to check out on ExpressVPN to help you learn more.<br />So, If you were hoping for the industry-standard AES-256 encryption and native OpenVPN support for secure connections, I‚Äôd suggest taking a look at an actualVPN service that works to protect you online. Thank you guys very much for watching and I'll see you in the next one.
