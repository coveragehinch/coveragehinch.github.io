{% raw %}Truth is not necessarily what you see with your eyes or what is reasonably accurate. Truth is the person of God. Every time you see truth, you behold God and the testimony of His Word.<br /><br />PRAYER: Loving father, I am grateful for your Word. It is the foundation of my victory, my source of strength and the affirmation on which I stand. I look at life through the eyes of the Word and behold truth every day. Nothing in this world can shake me because my walk is one of faith. Regardless of what is around me, I have created my world by the power of your Word and I see its realities manifest every day. In Jesusâ€™ name. Amen.<br /><br />#Phaneroo #PhanerooOnlineService #ApostleGraceLubega{% endraw %}
