He travelled to the US for a fresh start and new opportunity, never looking back. <br /><br />Landing in Virginia, First, PG became a waiter at a local restaurant to make ends meet. What he was making was barely enough to provide for his then growing family and PG needed a change. <br /><br />To make more money “PG” decided to get his CDL and started working for an “OTR” trucking company of which he was fired from only after a year. He continued to drive for other companies until a rollover caused him to be let go from his last. <br /><br />Difficult to find employment PG’s only choice was to get his own truck and become an owner-operator. <br /><br />By this time PG was saving his money and decided he would purchase his own truck and another shortly afterwards. He would also convince a friend from his community “ Shaan” to get into the trucking business with him and also purchase a few trucks of his own. <br /><br />The two decided to go into business together. Fate would have it that they would find a distressed intermodal trucking business in Virginia Beach, VA and be able to purchase it for just 10K right before the pandemic hit. The business needed work and After investing an additional 100K and working through the pandemic they got it up and running. <br /><br />Fast forward under 2 years later, PG and his team now own 40 + Trucks, Employ 50 + drivers and have a full office staff of 14 people working to grow Blue Dolphin Transportation.<br /><br />The company is currently doing a million dollars per month in revenue and have no plans on slowing down currently In The process of adding 10 more trucks to the fleet.<br /><br />PG and his team have plans to become one of the biggest names In the trucking industry and make an impact in the intermodal scene.  With the companies humble beginnings you can’t help but to route for their continued success. This is a must-hear story for anyone who is afraid of taking the leap and starting their own trucking business.
