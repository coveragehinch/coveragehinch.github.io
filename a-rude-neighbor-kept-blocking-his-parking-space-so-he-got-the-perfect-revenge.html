                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description">Angry AussieGam3r is the screen name of a Reddit user who had had enough with his annoying neighbor. He is also a skilled mechanic. His love for cars started when he was just a teenager. He loved to open the hood of a car to find out what made it tick. He loved to do little jobs. When he grew up, he decided to get his vehicle maintenance certificate, so he began an apprenticeship. It didn't take long for him to become an expert in his trade. He needed these skills to finally get back at his neighbor. <br /><br />At one point or another, most people will have a horrible neighbor. The neighbor can be loud, stomping on the floors upstairs all the time. Some neighbors throw wild parties and keep you up all night. Finally, there are some neighbors who can't seem to park their cars on their own side of the garage. <br /><br />AngryAussie had a neighbor who refused to park where he was supposed to. He warned his neighbor many times not to block him in. His neighbor never listened, and each time, his neighbor was blocking him again. Finally, he had had enough. His rage had boiled to the point where he decided that he had to do something crazy to get his neighbor to park correctly. <br /><br />In the building where AngryAussie lived, there were assigned parking areas for each apartment block. The concept was very simple. Each apartment had two designated parking spots, with each spot facing the other. This worked great because everyone could coordinate their vehicles so that nobody had to park against the barrier. <br /><br />AngryAussie had a parking plan so that nobody would ever get blocked in. He left the furthest spot open for visitors. When someone told him they were coming over, he made sure to park his car in the spot against the wall. This way, his guests could come and go when they needed to. Unfortunately, his horrible neighbor continued to mess up his perfect parking plan. <br /><br />Each time AngryAussie would leave a space open for his guests, his inconsiderate neighbor park in that space, blocking AngryAussie in. Because AngryAussie lived in a large apartment building, he had no idea which tenant was blocking him in. His first solution to the problem was to peacefully get his neighbor to stop taking his guest spot and blocking him in. <br /><br />AngryAussie wasn't the type of person to cause confrontation, but he wanted to get the neighbor stop. He wrote a note to his neighbor asking him not to park in his guest spot on Fridays. Just one week later, the horrible neighbor struck again. AngryAussie was planning to take a trip with his friends, and they were leaving on Saturday. When he went out to his car early Saturday morning, he was blocked in. AngryAussie was so mad that he decided to come up with a new plan. <br /><br />AngryAussie called the building manager. The tenant got drunk the night before, and he didn't move his car on Saturday morning. He didn't seem to care that his actions were constantly affecting other people. AngryAussie called the building manager who didn't want to get involved. Finally, AngryAussie decided to teach his neighbor a lesson. A rude neighbor kept blocking his parking space, so he got the perfect revenge.  <br /><br />AngryAussie got his hydraulic jacks and six friends. They jacked up the neighbor's car and started rolling it. They wheeled the car to the other side of the garage. On the opposite side, there was a support beam with a small parking space behind it. That is where they left his car. He was excited by the thought of his neighbor searching the parking garage for his car. <br /><br />When AngryAussie returned home from his trip, his neighbor's car was still in the spot where he and his friends left it. The noticed that the front end of the car was turned, which meant that the neighbor tried to move his car but couldn't. A few days later, AngryAussie realized that the car was gone and he never saw it again. Finally, he was free to come and go as he pleased. He never wanted it to come to this but after speaking to the building manager and leaving notes on his neighbor's car, nothing happened. His horrible neighbor kept parking in places where he shouldn't, blocking AngryAussie in. He knew that he had to take drastic steps to reclaim his parking spot and his freedom to come and go as he pleased. He was thrilled that his problems were finally over.<br />Like this content?
