Republicans are passing laws all over the country that will make it easier for them to challenge the results and throw out ballots, which means that the &quot;dry runs&quot; they've done this year will look amateurish in comparison, as Michael Waldman from the Brennan Center for Justice put it. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains what's happening. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2021/11/15/gops-next-coordinated-attempt-steal-election-wont-be-so-amateurish">https://www.commondreams.org/views/2021/11/15/gops-next-coordinated-attempt-steal-election-wont-be-so-amateurish</a><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

This wasn't their, their best efforts. This was something they kind of had to make up as they went along. And of course it hasn't worked out well for any of them, but that doesn't mean that it's not going to work for them in the future. And that's exactly the point that Michael Waldman from the bureau, a Brennan center for justice recently pointed out in an op-ed this year was amateurish. He said their future attempts to overturn elections will not be. And we know that because as a new report from the Brennan center pointed out Republicans across the country have been passing legislation that is effectively going to give them more power to help overturn election results. One of the things that has happened in at least two Republican controlled states is it gives them the authority to get rid of election officials and replace them with their partisan picks. So the people overseeing the elections, you know, county by county. They can look at it and say, I don't like it. This guy's a Democrat. Let's replace them with her because she is a Republican. <br /><br />And then of course, when they come to her and say, Hey, Mrs. Republican, uh, yeah, we, we have some things we don't like about this. Let's us switch things up a little bit. Let's say that these votes aren't, aren't quite right here. And of course, they're going to want their handpick political puppet to go along with this. And it's going to be easier because they're the ones putting their people in place. These people will obviously know whatever the plan is. And I'm not saying there's some sinister plot, a foot already, but that could be the end game here. We have also seen other attacks on our voting rights here. Lot of states out there, especially closer ones restricting the right to vote by mail restricting ballot boxes, restricting voting hours, purging people off the voting rolls. If you didn't vote in the last election, sorry you're off there. You got to go reregister and activate yourself. The next attempt to steal the election is going to be a lot more professional. It's going to be a lot more coordinated. They're not going to make it up as they go. So the big question is, how do we counter this? Well, of course, we've got that to John Lewis, voting rights act had still floating around in Congress. We can pass that. That is going to solve a lot of these problems, but not all of them. <br /><br />In some of these instances, I hate to be gloom and doom, but I don't see a path forward. I don't see a way we get around it because if they still have the laws that allow them to basically change out their election officials with their partisan hacks, that's not something that the John Lewis voting rights act. As far as I know addresses, we have people like Steve Bannon that have gone out there and encourage people. Hey, go run as an a for election official positions. They're encouraging people to take these positions, even in states, you know, where they can't just switch them out. They're already starting. And there's a reason they're putting these people in place.
